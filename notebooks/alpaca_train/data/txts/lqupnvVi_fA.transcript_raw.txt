 Hello friend my name is Azam Assood today we will discuss about agreements and contracts  friend let me tell you that it's a very interesting topic and I'm very hopeful  that you will definitely like the topic so let us start our tutorial first of  all I would request to subscribe to my channel and also click on the bell  option so let's start what is basically agreement and contract I hope that you  have definitely heard about these two terms very frequently in meetings in  discussions and with client so what is basically agreement friend agreement is  basically an understanding which basically reached between two or more  parties this is called an agreement remember one thing that it is not  necessary that agreement should be in a written form form basically agreement  means that it is an understanding between two parties and as it is not in  the written format it the agreement cannot be challenged or cannot be put  into a court of law so what is agreement agreement is basically understanding  between two or more parties now contract contract is basically a specific type of  agreement this is also an agreement that by its terms and elements is legal  binding and in enforceable in a court of law that means basically it has some  terms and conditions and it has some legal binding legal binding means that  if someone breach the terms and conditions then we can case a file in  the court of law so this is basically a main difference between a contract and  an agreement agreement is just understanding or mutual consensus  between two or more parties which cannot be challenged and which cannot be put  into court of law agreement contract is basically is also a type of agreement  but it has some terms and elements which has some legal formats which can  be which can be put into a court of law if there is any breach of terms so this  is basically a main difference between agreement and contract okay now what are  the basically requirement for agreement and contract friend remember one thing  that agreement means that there is some agreement there is some consensus between  two or more parties basically parties need only come to a common understanding  as to their relative rights and responsibilities and the requirement for  the formation of a contract are more precise and comparatively stricter  stricter mean for that what does that mean basically see whenever we do a  agreement the terms and conditions are very simple and it is not necessary that  they are very formal normally agreement is that agreement means informal things  and but when we talk about the contract it has some mutual consensus and the  things are more stricter more strict as compared to the agreement why because  the court of law the you always know that if any party breach the law or  breach the terms and condition it can be challenged it can be put into a into the  court of law now essential for contract what are the common things which are  very necessary for a contract whenever we do a contract between two or more  parties what are the essential what are the things which are necessary for  contract first of all offer and acceptance offer and acceptance means  that every contract must include a specific offer something to provide and  the acceptance of that offer okay what does that mean for example if you are  doing a employment contract so that means that employee has to offer some  services and company will offer him some sort of salary some benefits any bonus  some sort of like that so offer and acceptance mutual consent of mutual  consent mean the offer and acceptance must be freely consented by the parties  all parties must agree to the same terms and all must intend for a binding  agreement to be formed mutual consent means that both parties coming to the  same example employment contract like employees offering some services and  companies offering a salary so here comes the mutual consensus like both  parties are free both parties companies also free and employees also free so  both parties with a mutual consensus the agreement they contract the they sign  the contract so both parties sign the contract with a mutual consensus the  point of view the consensus is basically included from both parties from contract  from company and from employee as well consideration this is something of value  that is exchanged between the two parties consideration can take the form  of money goods or services but both parties must provide something of value  for a contract to be formed if only one side provide something it is a gift not  a contract same thing like for example it is necessary that both parties  contribute if only one party is contributing that means it is a gift so  basically contract is it is necessary that both parties provide some sort of  some sort any something like for example money goods services so when both  parties are contributing so so basically this is called a contract if one  party is only contributing this is a gift not a contract now competence  means both parties must comprehend the situation and understand what the  contract will entail thus no party can in a way that would prevent them from  understanding the terms of contract that means that the both parties should be  competent competent means that they know the scope of contract the terms and  conditions the agreements the mutual consensus so they knows the services the  scope and what would happen if they do they don't fulfill the requirements so  they both both parties both two or more parties should be competent enough to  understand the requirement of contract and they should understand that what  they have to deliver and they also should know the consequences if they  don't deliver the required services or things now legal purpose the purpose of  the contract must fall within the confines of lawful conduct in other words  a court would never enforce a contract regarding something illegal that means  that the whatever the contract is basically going to sign remember one  thing that all things should become under the legal boundaries remember one  thing that if if the contract is not under the legal binding remember one  thing that you cannot go into the court because if it is not under the law of  country so it cannot be challenged in the court of law so remember one thing  that whatever is basically going to sign in the contract it should come under the  laws of your country and one thing remember that if it is under the law of  your country so you can you can challenge the contract in the in the  court of law if there is any breach of any terms and condition but remember one  thing if it is not under the law of a country so it is definitely cannot be  changed there is no use to put in the contract so remember one thing there are  the things should be legal and come under the law of your country example of  agreement and contract agreement as we discussed that it is a very common  example of agreement with a mutual consensus for example you rent a car for  example tenancy agreements payment agreements very simple example of rent a  car for example you just phone a rental company and ask them that you have to go  somewhere they inform you that this is the rent of a car so if you buy with  mutual consensus you agree to the terms and condition and you pay the amount and  they provide you the services this is not necessary that things should be in  the written format it is very easy and quick service and it is a very common  example of agreement so remember one thing it is a mutual consensus and it is  an informal way of agreement contract common example of contract are non  disclosure agreements and user licenses employment contract and accepted  purchase order contract very common example of a contract is employment  contract for example company offers you some salary and you provide some  services of anything software IT anything so employment contract and the  NDA or non-disclosure agreements all these are the terms are these are the  forms of very formal contract and remember one thing that the contract  means that there are some terms and conditions which can be challenged it  can be put into a court of law this is the main difference between the  agreement and contract because agreement is an informal way and you and the co  contract is a very formal and a strict way of terms and condition now the next  topic is benefits of agreement remember one thing the primary benefit of an  agreement that does not meet the criteria of contract is that it is  inherently informal where the agreeing parties have a long-standing  relationship and share a considerable degree of trust the use of non-contract  agreement can save time and allow for more flexibility in the fulfillment of  the agreed upon obligations what does that mean basically remember agreement  means the mutual consensus between two or more parties and it is an informal way  so it is a very quick and just understand make and understanding  between two or more parties and we can start an agreement by agreeing with with  with the parties so it is a very informal way and it is a very quick way  to and it's also save time or as well and flexible as well so agreement means  the understanding mutual consensus between two or more parties it is safe  time quick flexible and fulfill the requirements benefits of contract the  main advantage of contract is that they spell out the specific terms that the  contracting parties have agreed upon and in the event of a breach where one or  more parties fail to fulfill their obligations serve as a guide to for a  court of law to determine the proper remedy for the injured for the injured  party or parties the main benefit of contract is that it is basically a very  formal way of mutual consensus and the terms and conditions so in case of any  breach of any terms and condition it can be challenged in the court of law so  this is basically the very basic and the very major con advantage of a  contract that the terms and conditions are very are very strict and in case of  any breach from any party so it can be challenged and can be put into a court  of law this is the very main and basic advantage of a contract now the PMP exam  as if it discuss about with respect to the PMP exam remember one thing that you  should expect few questions or multiple choice options related to agreement or  contract remember one thing whenever you go for a PMP exam you expect few  questions definitely related to agreement and contract so as a as a  attempt or as a student of PMP exam you should have a very clear understanding  about what is the difference between the agreement and the contract and where  should we use the agreement and where should we use the contract so this is  very necessary to understand the concept of agreement and contract and in  whenever you are going to give the exam of PMP you should expect a few questions  specifically related to agreement or contract and especially in the multiple  choice options of answers you would definitely see the term agreement and  contract so if you have a clear understanding to understand the  difference between agreement and contract and what are the consequences  of agreement or contract you can use it properly more questions you should  expect related to project charter as well because the project charter is also  a type of a contract basically signed by a company and by project manager so  you should expect few questions as well related to project charter as well as a  project manager you should have a clear understanding of agreement and contract  because see if as you know that you are if you are a project manager and also  executing some projects so you should have a knowledge about the difference  between the agreement and contract you should know that where to use the  agreement and what were to use the contract and as a project manager you  should have the clear understanding of contract because the contract has the  scope of a project and the terms and conditions which could be  applied anywhere so you should have a very clear understanding of a contract  you should read it properly so that you can use it properly in the project so  with respect to PMP exam with respect to project management or if you are going  to give exam of PMP you should have a clear understanding of agreement and  contract or if you are already a PMP certified person or you are already a  project manager or executing a project so you should have understanding of  agreement and contract that how we can use the agreement and contract and what  is the basically purpose of agreement and contract remember one thing always  remember one thing the agreement is basically a mutual consensus between two  or more parties and it is an informal way contract is basically mutual  consensus between two or more parties but it is a formal way and it can be  challenged it can be put into a court of law if any party breach the terms and  conditions so this is basically the major major main difference between  agreement and contract so friend I hope you like this video I have tried my  level best to explain the concept of agreement and contract  and I have tried my level best to give you and share
