 We have started this listening comprehension for you guys and this listening will help  you for your A1 Life Skills exam for the Phase 2A. Remember previously we have done question  making and answers and in today's video we are doing the listening for your Phase 2A.  In Phase 2A, there are two recordings that are played. You have to listen to both audios  and make the notes. First time when the examiner will play the audios, both audios, audio 1  and audio 2. Once, ek baar jab wo play karta hai, you have to listen to it and then you  have to give the answer. And in the second time when they play both recordings again,  they ask you two questions from each candidates, two to three questions. You have to make sure  that you write about both of the audios important components, important information. So whatever  recording they will ask you, so you know the answers for that. Thank you.
