[00:00:00 -> 00:00:11]  Hello, welcome, welcome. Hopefully, everyone can see me and hear me. Let me just get my
[00:00:11 -> 00:00:12]  screen sorted.
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:19]  Lovely. Hello, welcome. Hi, Edward. Nice to have you. I'm pretty sure you were here last
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:23]  time, weren't you? Welcome back. How are you doing? How's everybody doing? Please feel
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:27]  free to say hi in the chat. It's lovely to know who we've got here and it's always nice
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:34]  to have faces back again or names back again. So that's great. If you're new, welcome. If
[00:00:34 -> 00:00:42]  you're not new, welcome back. Good. I'm glad you're doing well. I'm glad you're doing well.
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:47]  We've been doing these web classes for ages. So if you're an old, probably already know
[00:00:47 -> 00:00:55]  to download slides for today's session, which are in the description below. So please feel
[00:00:55 -> 00:01:00]  free to go and check those out and download them. Keep them, scribble all over them now,
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:05]  save a second copy, whatever works for you. But they are very, very useful in order to
[00:01:05 -> 00:01:17]  get yourself prepped, ready for exams. If you're mid exams right now, then hopefully
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:22]  they're going really, really well. But if you're a year 12 student, or perhaps you're
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:28]  somebody just interested in understanding what A-level chemistry is like, then welcome.
[00:01:28 -> 00:01:33]  Please feel free to download the slides because you can use them for revision, etc, etc. We'll
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:38]  give it, oh, actually, no, we'll probably get started. Okay, let me get my screen sorted
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:46]  then and then we can get started. So this is our A-level chemistry web class on mass
[00:01:46 -> 00:01:55]  spectrometry. Oh, well, you probably should go and do a bit of revision then, I'm guessing.
[00:01:55 -> 00:02:05]  If it were me, I'd make sure I was doing a bit of revision. So this is our A-level chemistry
[00:02:05 -> 00:02:12]  web class on mass spectrometry. Yeah, hopefully everybody does go, everything does go well
[00:02:12 -> 00:02:19]  tomorrow. I'm sure it will. I'm sure it will. So our objectives then are to understand how
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:26]  mass spectrometry works, to calculate relative masses from mass spectra, and to determine
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:33]  molecular structures from mass spectra as well. So hopefully, well, this might be new
[00:02:33 -> 00:02:40]  to some people, but it's more likely to be revision for some of us. So hopefully everybody
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:46]  goes, everybody's feeling nice and confident about it. We're not going to look at specific
[00:02:46 -> 00:02:52]  details of TOF or time-of-flight mass spectrometry, because that is, I believe, only for AQA students.
[00:02:52 -> 00:02:57]  So we're not going to cover that specifically, but we are going to look at mass spec in general.
[00:02:57 -> 00:03:01]  And we're not going to look at the appearance of carbon-13 peaks, although I may mention
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:07]  it in the exam question, we'll see. Okay, so this is going to be about 50 minutes or
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:11]  so, and we'll try and whiz through as much of it as possible. We'll also try and have
[00:03:11 -> 00:03:17]  a go at some of our exam questions, because they are very useful. But in some cases, we
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:24]  may struggle to get through all of our questions. We'll do our best, though. We'll do our best.
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:30]  So what do we already know? What do we already know? And for some reason, my what do I already
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:35]  know is here, ahead of my specification points, but never mind. So what is relative atomic
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:44]  mass? Do we know what relative atomic mass is? Hi, Deaksha, as well. Lovely to have you
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:55]  here. What is relative atomic mass? Do we know? There's a very nice, there is a definition
[00:03:55 -> 00:04:00]  that we should know off by heart, because we have to be very specific with our understanding
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:05]  of relative atomic mass, because there's loads of different ones. There's relative atomic
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:09]  mass, there's just molecular mass, there's formula mass, there's isotopic mass, there's
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:14]  molar mass. So all of these things are ever so slightly different. So we do need to know
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:18]  the differences between them. And specifically, absolutely brilliant, we've got some great
[00:04:18 -> 00:04:25]  answers in the comments. Very specifically, it is the mass of a carbon atom compared to
[00:04:25 -> 00:04:30]  one twelfth the mass of, sorry, a mass of an atom compared to one twelfth the mass of
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:37]  a carbon atom. Brilliant. And even, yeah, lovely. It's also average. It's the average
[00:04:37 -> 00:04:44]  mass or mean mass of an atom compared to one twelfth the mass of carbon 12. Very nice.
[00:04:44 -> 00:05:04]  So relative atomic mass is the average mass of an atom of an element relative to one twelfth
[00:05:04 -> 00:05:13]  the mass of carbon 12, specifically carbon 12, because hopefully we do know that carbon
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:21]  have multiple isotopes, including carbon 13. So it's specifically the carbon 12 atom. And
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:26]  it's one twelfth the mass of carbon 12. Because at this point, when we determined relative
[00:05:26 -> 00:05:32]  atomic mass, we weren't 100% sure about protons existing. And because carbon is the most abundant
[00:05:32 -> 00:05:39]  element by mass, I believe, on Earth, and it's so important for us as carbon based life
[00:05:39 -> 00:05:45]  forms, we base it around carbon, but it's not actually a carbon atom, it's at one twelfth
[00:05:45 -> 00:05:52]  of the mass of a carbon atom, which happens to be the mass of a proton or a neutron, approximately.
[00:05:52 -> 00:05:55]  Isotope then is what? What is an isotope?
[00:06:01 -> 00:06:02]  Isotope.
[00:06:09 -> 00:06:15]  Oh, that's really nice, Alyssa. Very good. Brilliant. That's very succinct, very nice
[00:06:15 -> 00:06:19]  description. I'm not gonna have to write as much about it. I don't have very much space, but
[00:06:19 -> 00:06:29]  that's lovely. Really good. So the key thing, iso, I believe, means are different. So isotope,
[00:06:29 -> 00:06:34]  different structure, I think, is a very basic entomology of the word. So it's the same number
[00:06:34 -> 00:06:38]  of protons, but different numbers of neutrons. Really nice. So we know it's an atom of an
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:43]  element. I know it's carbon, for example, because it's got six protons, but it has a different
[00:06:43 -> 00:06:49]  number of neutrons. So it's a slightly heavier or slightly lighter atom of that element. Really
[00:06:49 -> 00:07:05]  nice. An atom of an element. So you can add in same number of protons, they will, in an exam,
[00:07:05 -> 00:07:10]  they will be for the same mark. So if you say it's an atom of a specific element, or if you say it's
[00:07:10 -> 00:07:14]  an atom with the same number of protons, they mean the same thing effectively. So they'd be for
[00:07:14 -> 00:07:26]  the same mark. An atom of an element with a different mass number, whoops, too many S's,
[00:07:26 -> 00:07:33]  mass number, or again, for the same part of the mark or the same mark, you can say different
[00:07:33 -> 00:07:44]  numbers of neutrons. So isotopes have different numbers of neutrons to each other. Really lovely.
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:47]  If at any point you can't read my handwriting, I know it is a bit scrappy, especially when I try
[00:07:47 -> 00:07:51]  and write fast, then just let me know and I can try and write something again, or I can tell you
[00:07:51 -> 00:07:57]  what it's supposed to say, even if it doesn't look like it. And of course, if you have any questions,
[00:07:57 -> 00:08:00]  pop them in the chat, and I'll do my best to answer them. If we speed through this content,
[00:08:01 -> 00:08:07]  we might even have some time at the end to ask generic chemistry questions as well if we need to.
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:11]  No worries, Dominic, nice to have you here. Welcome. Okay, what's this term molecular mass
[00:08:11 -> 00:08:16]  then? And if you can, do you know the difference between molecular mass and relative atomic mass?
[00:08:16 -> 00:08:20]  So specifically, if we want the molecular mass, what are we looking for the mass of?
[00:08:21 -> 00:08:26]  Molecular mass is what? And how do we calculate it as well is a good thing.
[00:08:31 -> 00:08:34]  Molecular mass.
[00:08:39 -> 00:08:41]  Anyone know? Hi, Marianne, nice to have you.
[00:08:45 -> 00:08:52]  Hopefully you're doing well, ready for tomorrow. I'm sure you are. Yeah, lovely, Dominic. So
[00:08:52 -> 00:08:59]  molecular mass is the relative atomic masses of inner molecule all added up. Yeah, brilliant.
[00:09:01 -> 00:09:11]  Lovely. So it's the sum of all of the relative atomic masses. Oops, can't spell. Relative
[00:09:13 -> 00:09:23]  atomic masses, the sum of all the relative atomic masses of all of the atoms
[00:09:23 -> 00:09:31]  in a, whoops, in a molecule. I think my screen just went blank there, but hopefully it's back
[00:09:31 -> 00:09:37]  again. In a molecule. Lovely. So specifically, it's the mass of a molecule, one molecule
[00:09:37 -> 00:09:43]  of something. Okay, compared to relative atomic mass, which is just the mass of one atom,
[00:09:43 -> 00:09:47]  the average mass of one atom, taking into account all of the isotopes.
[00:09:47 -> 00:09:52]  Lovely. Let's keep going then. So for some reason, these are in an odd order. So usually we
[00:09:52 -> 00:09:57]  did spec points first, but never mind. So if you're an AQA student, these are specification
[00:09:57 -> 00:10:03]  points that we're going to be covering. If you're an Edexcel student, these are specification
[00:10:03 -> 00:10:09]  points that we are looking at today. And then if you're an OCR student, these are the OCR
[00:10:09 -> 00:10:12]  spec points we're going to be covering. I say this every time, but I think it's so important
[00:10:13 -> 00:10:17]  and print it off and have it next to you because it's such a good revision tool.
[00:10:17 -> 00:10:21]  Whenever you go to lessons, you can tick off, oh, I think we did that today, or,
[00:10:21 -> 00:10:26]  oh, I didn't understand that. I'll need to revise that specifically or whatever. So hopefully
[00:10:27 -> 00:10:33]  you can use your specifications as checklists, basically, for your revision in this. So, so,
[00:10:33 -> 00:10:40]  so useful. Okay, so let's move on then. So let's move on to the next one. So this is
[00:10:40 -> 00:10:46]  so, so useful. Oh, nice, Marianne. That's what we like to hear. Very good. Well done. I'm impressed.
[00:10:49 -> 00:10:54]  Okay, so a little bit of mass spectrometry basics. Mass spectrometry is a method used
[00:10:54 -> 00:11:01]  to determine the mass of elements, isotopes, and molecules. So you can put almost anything
[00:11:01 -> 00:11:05]  into a mass spectrometer. Some molecules won't do so well in a mass spectrometer because they'll
[00:11:05 -> 00:11:10]  be too big. But you can put most things in and we can use it to work out, for example,
[00:11:10 -> 00:11:15]  what a mixture is made of. Maybe you've made a new substance and you've got no idea what it is.
[00:11:16 -> 00:11:22]  We use mass spectrometry in order to determine structure and it's part of a chemical analysis.
[00:11:23 -> 00:11:27]  So we need to have some idea and AQA students, you're going to need to know a little bit more
[00:11:27 -> 00:11:35]  detail than we're going to cover here. But we need to know the basic process that occurs in
[00:11:35 -> 00:11:42]  order to perform mass spectrometry. So step one is ionization. Briefly, what does that mean?
[00:11:43 -> 00:11:50]  Ionization, what's happening in the ionization section? So this is our ionization area.
[00:11:51 -> 00:11:56]  What happens? So basically, what is ionization? What does that mean?
[00:11:57 -> 00:12:00]  It's a phrase that hopefully we know, but what does it mean?
[00:12:01 -> 00:12:05]  Yeah, good. Ionization is the loss or gain of electrons. So in the ionization section,
[00:12:05 -> 00:12:11]  we turn them into positive ions. I believe there are some forms of mass spectrometry where you can
[00:12:11 -> 00:12:16]  add an electron, but the ones that we learn at A-level and for the most part, you're absolutely
[00:12:16 -> 00:12:21]  right, we turn them into positive ions. We knock an electron off, at least one electron off,
[00:12:22 -> 00:12:32]  and we end up with a positively charged molecule or ion or isotope, and then it can
[00:12:32 -> 00:12:43]  enter into the rest of the spectrometer. Very nice. Okie dokie. So ionization, so one, like I
[00:12:43 -> 00:12:47]  say, or more, we can knock off more than one, but then you're getting quite unstable. One or more
[00:12:48 -> 00:13:10]  electrons is, one or more electron is knocked off a sample, leaving an ion with a positive
[00:13:12 -> 00:13:16]  charge. And obviously, if you knock off one electron, then as I think some people said,
[00:13:16 -> 00:13:19]  it's one plus charge, you knock off two electrons, it's two plus charge, etc.
[00:13:23 -> 00:13:33]  This is for A2 content, but what happens, what can be an issue or sometimes it's useful
[00:13:33 -> 00:13:37]  with knocking electrons off and destabilizing molecules, what can happen,
[00:13:37 -> 00:13:42]  therefore, in mass spectrometry, which is sometimes useful, sometimes not.
[00:13:43 -> 00:13:47]  If we've destabilized our molecules by knocking an electron off, if you've got a molecule,
[00:13:47 -> 00:13:52]  so it doesn't happen with elements or isotopes, but if you've got a molecule and you knock an
[00:13:52 -> 00:13:58]  electron off, so you destabilize it, what can happen to the molecule? Or we call it when they,
[00:13:58 -> 00:14:06]  yeah, lovely Hallie, exactly right. We can get fragmentation occurs. So sometimes
[00:14:06 -> 00:14:16]  sometimes fragmentation occurs, just means it breaks up into smaller bits.
[00:14:17 -> 00:14:21]  And we'll look at that a little bit more later on. Okay, so now we've got our ions,
[00:14:21 -> 00:14:28]  it has to be an ion, otherwise, it's not going to be accelerated through our electric fields.
[00:14:28 -> 00:14:33]  So it has to because it has to be a charged ion, otherwise, it's not going to be accelerated.
[00:14:33 -> 00:14:37]  So then, because it's charged, it can be accelerated in our acceleration area.
[00:14:38 -> 00:14:46]  Oh, no, sorry, I've gone back. There we go. It can be accelerated through our acceleration area.
[00:14:48 -> 00:14:53]  And so how does this occur? Let me rub that out, that's useful. Okay, never mind.
[00:14:53 -> 00:15:06]  So the ions are attracted. Yeah, very nice, Hallie. Very good. Attracted slash accelerated.
[00:15:08 -> 00:15:16]  Accelerated. Oops, I didn't mean to write that. Ions, I can't rub it out. I try to do accelerated
[00:15:16 -> 00:15:31]  using a negative electric field. Opposites attract. And therefore, you get, oh, we'll come
[00:15:31 -> 00:15:36]  to that in a second, Candy. Therefore, you get an attraction. If you get an attraction,
[00:15:36 -> 00:15:40]  but they're traveling at a high speed, so they don't kind of veer off and stick to
[00:15:40 -> 00:15:46]  our negative plates. Oh, I forgot, I can't rub that out. They are attracted and they go
[00:15:46 -> 00:15:50]  through a gap where they're attracted to another plate, which they go past,
[00:15:50 -> 00:15:54]  which they're attracted to another plate, they go past. And eventually, they speed up so much
[00:15:55 -> 00:16:02]  that you get separation occurring. So the separation occurs where the heavier molecules
[00:16:02 -> 00:16:10]  take longer to travel through a straight mass spectrometer. Or if you've got a curved
[00:16:11 -> 00:16:17]  one, then your heavier molecules will have a, what they're called, a larger parabola.
[00:16:17 -> 00:16:21]  They will be traveled on a larger curve and the lighter molecules will travel on a shorter curve.
[00:16:21 -> 00:16:26]  And that's how you can therefore work out how big or small your molecules are. Or like I said,
[00:16:26 -> 00:16:32]  if you've got a straight, what they're called, flight path, then the lighter molecules will
[00:16:32 -> 00:16:39]  travel faster. Heavier molecules will travel slower because they're heavier, momentum,
[00:16:39 -> 00:16:43]  all that physically stuff, until they get detected at the detector.
[00:16:45 -> 00:16:54]  So the lighter, this is with a straight flight path, the lighter molecules travel,
[00:16:57 -> 00:17:03]  I can't rub out, travel faster, so are detected first.
[00:17:10 -> 00:17:16]  And then also more highly charged ions as well will travel first because they will be higher,
[00:17:16 -> 00:17:21]  they'll have a greater attraction in the acceleration area. And how are they detected?
[00:17:22 -> 00:17:26]  How are ions detected in an ion detector? Does anybody know?
[00:17:32 -> 00:17:37]  Because they are charged particles, they actually can cause
[00:17:40 -> 00:17:47]  Yes, good, lovely. So they can gain an electron, which causes a flow of electrons, a movement
[00:17:47 -> 00:17:52]  of electrons, which is current. So they generate a current or they cause current to occur. Really
[00:17:52 -> 00:18:03]  nice. So ions cause current on detector plates, detector plates by gaining electrons.
[00:18:04 -> 00:18:11]  Really nice. Okay, anybody not happy with any of that, just let me know. Otherwise, let's have a
[00:18:11 -> 00:18:18]  quick look at doing some of our, quote unquote, most more basic mass spectrometry application.
[00:18:20 -> 00:18:27]  So usually, especially if we're looking at AS in year 12, we only really focus on using mass
[00:18:28 -> 00:18:35]  spectrometry to look at our relative isotopic mass calculations. So initially, when we were first
[00:18:35 -> 00:18:42]  developing and discovering ions and isotopes, even, it was really, really useful to use mass
[00:18:42 -> 00:18:51]  spectrometry to determine approximate relative abundances of our isotopes. It's still very,
[00:18:51 -> 00:18:59]  very useful. But we've kind of worked out what our relative abundances are by now. So it's actually
[00:18:59 -> 00:19:06]  more useful maybe doing analysis of chemical molecules. However, this is one of the things
[00:19:06 -> 00:19:13]  that we look at first when we think about mass spectrometry. So how do we do it? Does anybody
[00:19:13 -> 00:19:18]  know what the equation is? Can you remember? Have you recalled the equation maybe from GCSE?
[00:19:18 -> 00:19:25]  Because we do cover it, not specifically using mass spectrometry, but we look at relative abundances
[00:19:25 -> 00:19:32]  and stuff at GCSE. Does anybody know how do we calculate the relative atomic mass of a sample
[00:19:33 -> 00:19:39]  if we've been given the relative abundance and the effective relative mass or the mass to charge
[00:19:39 -> 00:19:53]  ratio? Anybody know? So our relative, oh, that's funny, relative
[00:19:55 -> 00:20:03]  atomic mass is calculated using what? Oh, lovely. Yeah.
[00:20:03 -> 00:20:07]  Exactly right. Good. So it's the sum of, because we've got about, add them all up,
[00:20:07 -> 00:20:12]  the sum of the relative abundance, which I'm going to call RA because I don't have much space.
[00:20:12 -> 00:20:21]  Actually, I can just call it abundance. Abundance, yep, times by the relative atomic,
[00:20:22 -> 00:20:27]  sorry, the mass to charge ratio, which we're assuming, especially A-level, that the mass to
[00:20:27 -> 00:20:31]  charge ratio is one, because only one electron would have been removed. So the mass to charge
[00:20:31 -> 00:20:37]  ratio is just their mass, because it's the mass divided by one. Having said that, they may sneak
[00:20:37 -> 00:20:43]  a sneaky question in, potentially, but it's unlikely. So abundance times the mass, which we
[00:20:43 -> 00:20:50]  take to be the mass to charge ratio. Sorry. Yeah, that. And then we divide by 100. Why are we dividing
[00:20:51 -> 00:21:07]  by 100? Why are we dividing by 100? That looks great, Alyssa. Lovely. So let's just check.
[00:21:08 -> 00:21:17]  So 35 times 75%. Good. It's the sum of abundance. Because it's a percentage, it's out of 100.
[00:21:17 -> 00:21:23]  So we have to divide by 100. Really nice. That's useful to remember, just in case they give you an
[00:21:23 -> 00:21:29]  abundance that's not 100%. If they give you an abundance that's not as a percentage, then you'd
[00:21:29 -> 00:21:36]  need to divide by that amount. This is all to do with developing our math skills. Nice. So it's 35
[00:21:36 -> 00:21:44]  times our 75% plus, I'm not going to put the percentage in actually, plus our 37, which is
[00:21:44 -> 00:21:53]  the mass of our other isotope, times 25% divided by the total percentage, which is 100. And so
[00:21:53 -> 00:22:00]  chlorine should be, if we've got it right, should have a relative atomic mass of 35.5. If you get
[00:22:00 -> 00:22:04]  these questions in an exam, it is possible that they will give you a number which is ever so
[00:22:04 -> 00:22:09]  slightly different. Sorry, the answer will be a number which is ever so slightly different to the
[00:22:09 -> 00:22:15]  one you've got in your periodic table. So don't panic. If it is, just double check your numbers
[00:22:15 -> 00:22:21]  and make sure you're happy that you've done all the calculations correctly. Because if they gave
[00:22:21 -> 00:22:25]  you a number, for example, 35.5, which is what's given in our periodic table, you could just quote
[00:22:25 -> 00:22:32]  that. And they would be obliged to give you at least one mark. So they may sneakily, or they may
[00:22:32 -> 00:22:37]  get you to quote it to, for example, two decimal places, in which case you need to make sure that
[00:22:37 -> 00:22:43]  you give it to the number of decimal places they've asked for. But it's always worth, and I'm
[00:22:43 -> 00:22:47]  sure you already do, checking with your periodic table. If you're calculating the relative atomic
[00:22:47 -> 00:22:54]  mass of chlorine, and you get 70, you've probably done something wrong. If you're looking at
[00:22:54 -> 00:22:59]  calculating the relative atomic mass of bromine, and you get three, you've probably done something
[00:22:59 -> 00:23:04]  wrong. Because it will be a number similar to the periodic table, but it may not be identical.
[00:23:05 -> 00:23:09]  Okay, how's everyone feeling? How confident are you feeling about all of that? So this is a way
[00:23:09 -> 00:23:14]  for me to understand how confident you guys are feeling, but also for you guys to assess
[00:23:14 -> 00:23:22]  yourselves. How confident are you? If you can revise, are you actually fine? You've got this sorted?
[00:23:24 -> 00:23:28]  Lovely. So you can give me a number, you can tell me, or you can give me a smiley face,
[00:23:28 -> 00:23:33]  it's entirely up to you, whichever you prefer. Awesome. That looks good.
[00:23:35 -> 00:23:39]  Fair. And if you're halfway between the two, that's also absolutely fine.
[00:23:40 -> 00:23:46]  Lovely. Really nice. Fantastic. Okie dokie. Cool. Don't forget to ask questions if you do have them.
[00:23:47 -> 00:23:53]  But otherwise, we will keep pushing on. Okay, so this is an example question, it's a past paper
[00:23:53 -> 00:23:58]  question about mass spectrometry. So it says, the copper used to make a batch of coins is
[00:23:58 -> 00:24:02]  analysed by mass spectrometry. The mass spectrum is shown below.
[00:24:05 -> 00:24:10]  Calculate the relative atomic mass of the copper used to make the coins.
[00:24:10 -> 00:24:18]  Give your answer to two decimal places. So we basically got to do exactly the same thing.
[00:24:18 -> 00:24:25]  The one thing that I will do just to be sure, and you can assume that they aren't trying to trip you
[00:24:25 -> 00:24:32]  up, but I will just make sure that my percentages add up. Because if they don't, there may have been
[00:24:32 -> 00:24:38]  a bit of information in the question that I've missed telling me about a third isotope or something
[00:24:38 -> 00:24:44]  like that. So because it only takes me half a second, I'm just going to check, do those numbers
[00:24:44 -> 00:24:51]  add up? Yes, they do. Great. That's fine. So I'm happy that I'm only using these values here.
[00:24:51 -> 00:24:57]  I haven't missed anything in the question. It's a nice quick check. So anybody got a value for me
[00:24:57 -> 00:25:03]  then? So we're calculating relative atomic mass. It's the same as we did before. It's the sum of
[00:25:03 -> 00:25:15]  the abundance times by what we're assuming is the exact mass divided by 100. That looks good. So
[00:25:16 -> 00:25:25]  don't forget to keep the numbers associated with each other. So 69.17% of the coins have a mass of
[00:25:25 -> 00:25:33]  63. So I need to keep those numbers together. So 69.17 times 63 plus, and then I need to keep those
[00:25:33 -> 00:25:48]  numbers together, 30.83 times 65. And then I divide the whole thing by 100 should give me 63.16,
[00:25:48 -> 00:25:58]  sorry, no, 6166. Lovely. Well done to those of you that read slash remembered. It says,
[00:25:58 -> 00:26:02]  give your answer to two decimal places. And when I go to write something in on the answer line,
[00:26:02 -> 00:26:07]  I always go back and check. It's usually at the bottom of the question. So I always go back and
[00:26:07 -> 00:26:13]  check have they asked for significant figures or decimal points, decimal places, sorry. And it's
[00:26:13 -> 00:26:17]  usually at the bottom of the question. So it's usually fairly easy to find. In this case, yes,
[00:26:17 -> 00:26:27]  they've asked for two decimal places. So that would be 63.62. Well done, everybody. Fantastic.
[00:26:28 -> 00:26:34]  Next bit of the question says, bromine has two isotopes with relative atomic masses 79 and 81.
[00:26:35 -> 00:26:41]  Which of the following values for mass to charge ratio could correspond to a peak in the mass
[00:26:41 -> 00:26:47]  spectrum of bromine, Br2? You should assume that the ions detected have a single positive charge.
[00:26:47 -> 00:26:55]  So this is where maybe in some cases, they can try to trick you. Because if you've got a molecule
[00:26:55 -> 00:27:00]  or something, you can move, remove more than anything, you can remove more than one electron.
[00:27:00 -> 00:27:04]  But here, they specifically said, you should assume the ions detect to have a single positive
[00:27:04 -> 00:27:11]  charge. So they only had one electron removed. What are we thinking? Which of these following
[00:27:11 -> 00:27:16]  values for mass to charge ratio could correspond to a peak in the mass spectrum of bromine?
[00:27:17 -> 00:27:25]  So it's the mass divided by one, that's what we've been told, it's got a charge of one,
[00:27:25 -> 00:27:32]  so mass divided by one, does it equal 79.9? For bromine, does it equal 80?
[00:27:32 -> 00:27:40]  Does it equal 159? Or does it equal 160? Anybody want to have a go?
[00:27:41 -> 00:27:45]  What do we think? A, B, C, or D?
[00:27:48 -> 00:27:56]  Bromine has two isotopes of relative isotopic masses of 79 and 81. So bromine can have a mass
[00:27:57 -> 00:28:01]  of 79. Or it can have a mass of 81.
[00:28:04 -> 00:28:12]  Oh, nice, we have had some, good, we've definitely had some thoughts. So it is,
[00:28:12 -> 00:28:19]  and they've even told you, they've even told you that it is Br2, good. And therefore, very nice,
[00:28:19 -> 00:28:25]  we know it's BrBr. So we just got to work out a quick bit of maths, what could it be?
[00:28:25 -> 00:28:33]  So our bromines could be 79, or they could be 81, or they could be one of each. So we can have 79
[00:28:33 -> 00:28:42]  and a 79. We can have a 79 and an 81. We could have an 81 and a 79. Or we can have an 81 and an
[00:28:42 -> 00:28:54]  81. And so a quick bit of maths should tell us what they add up to. So that's 158. Or that'd be
[00:28:54 -> 00:29:13]  160. Or 160. Or 162. So our peak is definitely going to be 160. D, well done. Those of you that
[00:29:13 -> 00:29:17]  said D, brilliant. Really nice. And they like these kind of questions, because it really,
[00:29:17 -> 00:29:21]  especially as a multiple choice question, because it really means you have to think about what
[00:29:21 -> 00:29:25]  they're telling you, what the information is you've been given, and how to apply it. So very
[00:29:25 -> 00:29:31]  nice. Very, very good. How are we doing for time? Not bad. Okay, so let's have a thinker then.
[00:29:32 -> 00:29:38]  This is kind of more Year 13 content, because it's more chemical analysis, but we should hopefully
[00:29:38 -> 00:29:43]  still be at the level where we can understand it and apply it and think about it. So let's have a
[00:29:43 -> 00:29:52]  go at some molecule identification. Okay, so relative molecular masses. We spoke briefly,
[00:29:52 -> 00:29:58]  and again, this is I think, where we think about it more in Year 13, or A, the full A level than
[00:29:58 -> 00:30:04]  Year 12. But molecules can fragment during ionisation, they can break apart. Now they
[00:30:04 -> 00:30:10]  don't break apart and join back together randomly, they will only break apart by breaking a bond.
[00:30:11 -> 00:30:17]  So we can use a mass spectrum to find the molecular mass peak, and some of the fragments.
[00:30:17 -> 00:30:23]  And if we can think about some of the fragments, we know what makes, what puts together,
[00:30:23 -> 00:30:32]  what puts together, we know what makes up our molecule. So can anybody, and it's not so easy
[00:30:32 -> 00:30:36]  to see, but can anybody come up? No worries, Deeksha, have a lovely rest of your weekend.
[00:30:36 -> 00:30:41]  See you soon. Can anybody tell me any information they can get from this spectrum?
[00:30:42 -> 00:30:48]  What information can we, can we glean from it? Can we work out what any of the peaks mean?
[00:30:49 -> 00:30:50]  What they represent?
[00:30:55 -> 00:31:00]  That's a good question, Naz. When do you know if it's an isotope of carbon or hydrogen? So
[00:31:01 -> 00:31:05]  let's have a think about what this, and thank you, Marianne, we'll come to that in a second,
[00:31:05 -> 00:31:10]  that's really good. Let's have a think about what that peak means.
[00:31:15 -> 00:31:19]  So for OCR, you do have to be able to do fragmentation peaks, I believe.
[00:31:21 -> 00:31:26]  Yeah, I think so. Good, that's the molecular ion peak.
[00:31:26 -> 00:31:33]  Yeah, I think so. Good, that's the molecular ion peak. Very nice, the MR or M plus peak,
[00:31:33 -> 00:31:42]  molecular ion peak. So that's the molecular ion peak, and if it's a molecular ion peak, we know
[00:31:43 -> 00:31:49]  that it represents the whole molecule, but with an electron removed. So just to come back to
[00:31:49 -> 00:31:54]  Naz's question about isotopes, this is, I said, or we may or may not mention it,
[00:31:54 -> 00:31:58]  so we're going to mention it. This tiny peak down here, which we can't really see,
[00:32:00 -> 00:32:07]  that tiny peak down there is due to the fact that something like 0.01%, I can never remember the
[00:32:07 -> 00:32:15]  actual number, of carbon atoms are carbon-13. So if you've got one, maybe, one carbon in the
[00:32:15 -> 00:32:24]  whole of our sample that's carbon-13, then that molecule will have one more mass, a mass of one
[00:32:24 -> 00:32:30]  more than everything else. Carbon normally, if we look down here, carbon normally has a mass of 12.
[00:32:30 -> 00:32:37]  So if this is ethanol, it will have a mass of 12 times 2, 2 carbons plus 1 oxygen
[00:32:38 -> 00:32:41]  plus 1, 2, 3, 6 hydrogens,
[00:32:43 -> 00:32:50]  gives us a total mass of 46. So normally, our ethanol will have a peak of 46, but this tiny
[00:32:50 -> 00:32:59]  peak here is because one of the molecules maybe has a carbon-13 in it. So actually, that one will
[00:32:59 -> 00:33:09]  have a peak molecular mass of 47. Let me know if that doesn't help. So when we look for our
[00:33:09 -> 00:33:13]  molecular ion peak, our M plus peak, so the plus, just to answer your question, Mr. Avey,
[00:33:13 -> 00:33:19]  the plus, because it's an ion, it's the molecular ion. It's an ion, but it's had an electron removed,
[00:33:19 -> 00:33:24]  which means it has a positive charge. It's got one more proton, therefore, than it does electron.
[00:33:24 -> 00:33:30]  So it has an overall positive charge. So the M plus peak is telling us because it's a molecular
[00:33:30 -> 00:33:35]  ion, M plus molecular ion. Let me know if that doesn't help. Cool, good, lovely.
[00:33:37 -> 00:33:42]  So when we look for the molecular ion peak, you look for the most significant peak furthest to
[00:33:42 -> 00:33:47]  the right. So in this case, we have actually got a minuscule peak right over there to the right,
[00:33:47 -> 00:33:53]  just to the right of our M plus peak, but it's tiny. So that one can't be our molecular ion
[00:33:53 -> 00:33:58]  peak because it's not representing the whole molecule. It's only representing a tiny, tiny
[00:33:58 -> 00:34:04]  fraction of molecules. So the M plus peak is the most significant peak furthest to the right. So it
[00:34:04 -> 00:34:10]  might be second furthest to the right because of a carbon-13 peak, or it may be the most,
[00:34:10 -> 00:34:15]  the furthest peak if we don't have or don't count that tiny, tiny carbon-13 peak.
[00:34:15 -> 00:34:20]  Good. So, Jianne, hopefully I've said your name right. Apologies if I haven't, but you're
[00:34:20 -> 00:34:25]  absolutely right. So the highest mass peak we've seen there is the molecular ion peak,
[00:34:25 -> 00:34:29]  and then the other ones are our fragments. So let's work out what some of these fragments
[00:34:29 -> 00:34:34]  are. So I'm going to skip on to the next one. So we've got our M plus peak. I'll just relabel that.
[00:34:35 -> 00:34:43]  We've got, oh, sorry. We've got our, we sometimes call it M plus one or our M plus
[00:34:44 -> 00:34:51]  one or our carbon-13 peak as well. And then we mentioned some fragments.
[00:34:53 -> 00:34:57]  Brilliant. Thank you. Then we mentioned some fragments. So Marianne, I think it was said
[00:34:57 -> 00:35:03]  that our peak at 15, where is that? One, two, three, four, five. Here we go. So we've got a
[00:35:03 -> 00:35:10]  peak at 15. We've got a peak at 17. We've got a peak at 29. We've got a peak at 31.
[00:35:11 -> 00:35:22]  What do these masses represent? So a peak at 15 is going to be CH3 because one carbon has got
[00:35:22 -> 00:35:33]  a mass of 12 and three hydrogens have a mass of three. So 15 is because of our CH3 fragment.
[00:35:33 -> 00:35:44]  So that could be perhaps when our structure has broken in that bond. If it has broken at that
[00:35:44 -> 00:35:49]  bond, we've got our CH3 bit, but we should also be able to find peaks that represent the rest of
[00:35:49 -> 00:35:56]  the molecule. So let's use my colours. I love a bit of colour. Let's use my colours here. So we've
[00:35:56 -> 00:36:11]  got that one peak 15, which is due to our CH3 fragment. If we've got our CH3 fragment, yeah,
[00:36:11 -> 00:36:16]  lovely. Looks like some people have recognised the other bit, which I'm going to do in blue,
[00:36:16 -> 00:36:20]  because if it's broken, you've got to have one, you've got to have both bits. You can't just
[00:36:20 -> 00:36:24]  randomly only have one bit and not the other. So you've got to have both bits. So the other bit
[00:36:24 -> 00:36:30]  would be a peak at 12, 13, 14, 15, 31. So I'll put that on there.
[00:36:33 -> 00:36:40]  Here's our CH2OH peak. And it's positively charged because the whole molecule will be
[00:36:40 -> 00:36:44]  positively charged and it's broken off, so we can label it as being positively charged. So that's
[00:36:44 -> 00:36:56]  our peak at 31. Yeah, lovely, really nice. So we've recognised that OH is likely to be our one at 17.
[00:36:59 -> 00:37:04]  Because if we've broken that bond there, we've just snatched the OH off. So we've got our OH
[00:37:04 -> 00:37:07]  peak and that means we should also see the rest of the molecule as well.
[00:37:08 -> 00:37:13]  So hopefully that will work out nicely. So that's our OH bit.
[00:37:15 -> 00:37:18]  Good, really nice. It looks like other people have recognised that as well. And
[00:37:18 -> 00:37:22]  we're absolutely right. That means if we've snapped it at that point,
[00:37:23 -> 00:37:32]  then the rest of the molecule must be or is our peak at 29. So our molecule doesn't fragment,
[00:37:32 -> 00:37:37]  this molecule doesn't fragment in many other ways apart from those ones we've recognised here.
[00:37:38 -> 00:37:43]  And you will notice as well that you get the two halves of the peaks if it snaps in.
[00:37:45 -> 00:37:49]  Notice that our peak at 31 is quite abundant, so that's likely to be
[00:37:49 -> 00:37:53]  perhaps the other bits have broken down a little bit or have fragmented further.
[00:37:55 -> 00:38:00]  What we're doing 29, that one, which is CH2CH3.
[00:38:00 -> 00:38:10]  That one as well. And we know we've got our M plus peak as well. It's really useful to use
[00:38:10 -> 00:38:15]  fragmentation patterns when you're trying to determine structures of molecules, because,
[00:38:15 -> 00:38:22]  as you can see here, here we have got a molecule which also has an MR of 46.
[00:38:25 -> 00:38:29]  Why do we know and how can we be sure? If you were given this an exam question,
[00:38:29 -> 00:38:35]  how would you prove or how would you explain that this spectrum is definitely of ethanol
[00:38:35 -> 00:38:39]  and not of this other molecule, this ether?
[00:38:41 -> 00:38:45]  What would you be looking out for, perhaps, do you think, if you thought this might be
[00:38:45 -> 00:38:51]  a structure of an ether? I'm going to go for purple.
[00:38:52 -> 00:38:59]  Lovely, Mr. A.B. Why would you have a 33? What would the 33 be? So AQA.
[00:39:07 -> 00:39:11]  I feel like we do have to do fragmentation, but not until A2.
[00:39:16 -> 00:39:19]  Because I've definitely talked on the AQA specification.
[00:39:22 -> 00:39:28]  Yeah, Naz agrees. Okay, cool. It's not just me. Yeah, lovely. Well done. So this bit,
[00:39:28 -> 00:39:39]  this fragment at 16, 28, 29, 30, 31. Hold on, let me check my calculation because I
[00:39:40 -> 00:39:47]  don't trust my mental arithmetic. 31. So there may also be a peak at 31.
[00:39:47 -> 00:39:54]  There may also be a peak at 31. Oh, you learned it in AS. Okay, fair enough. It might be in AS as
[00:39:54 -> 00:40:01]  well. Something in my head told me that it's kind of when you go back to it for A2, but that could
[00:40:01 -> 00:40:07]  have just been the way that we taught it. Because we taught it as a full two year thing. So that
[00:40:07 -> 00:40:14]  could have just been the way that we taught it. But good. So there is a peak at 17. There is a
[00:40:14 -> 00:40:22]  peak at 31. So that would be, that one would be our peak at 15. That won't be a peak of 31. However,
[00:40:23 -> 00:40:27]  there's no way to get a peak of 29,
[00:40:30 -> 00:40:36]  which is definitely present. And there's no way, as you say, to get a peak of 17,
[00:40:36 -> 00:40:47]  which is definitely present. So we know that this spectra shows ethanol, not this ether,
[00:40:47 -> 00:40:53]  because we've got peaks at 17 and 29, which corresponds to fragments of ethanol. And they
[00:40:53 -> 00:41:01]  are not present. Those fragments cannot be present or aren't present in our ether. What's the functional
[00:41:01 -> 00:41:06]  group on an ether? The functional group is the carbon, single bond oxygen, single bond carbon.
[00:41:06 -> 00:41:14]  That's the ether functional group. You may have met it once or twice. It's one of those functional
[00:41:14 -> 00:41:19]  groups, which you perhaps maybe mentioned in passing sometimes, or you know of because we know
[00:41:20 -> 00:41:25]  that, yeah, we know that it's an isomer. Sometimes it can be used in isomer questions,
[00:41:25 -> 00:41:32]  drawing structural isomers or functional group isomers. You may have met it because dry ether
[00:41:32 -> 00:41:37]  is a solvent that's used when we can't have water present. So you may have heard it then,
[00:41:37 -> 00:41:43]  but it's one of those functional groups which we touch on a tiny bit because it rarely comes up.
[00:41:45 -> 00:41:49]  It's good to kind of recognise that it can exist, but I wouldn't worry too much about it apart from
[00:41:49 -> 00:42:03]  that. Cool. Let's just put that as an ether. Yeah, exactly. Good. Okay, right. Let's quiz on.
[00:42:03 -> 00:42:09]  Well done, everybody. So let me know how confident you're feeling. And then we'll have a go through
[00:42:09 -> 00:42:14]  some of our exam questions. We may have time for all of them, but I am gonna have to disappear
[00:42:14 -> 00:42:21]  just before the hour, just before six for another lesson. Do I have any predictions for tomorrow?
[00:42:21 -> 00:42:28]  I would hate to predict because they're all so different for different specifications.
[00:42:30 -> 00:42:38]  There are loads of topics that come up, you know, in different exam boards in their specific
[00:42:38 -> 00:42:43]  papers almost every year. And although it's not every year, it is almost every year. So if you
[00:42:43 -> 00:42:49]  look back through a couple of past papers, you'll find that there are very repetitive questions. So
[00:42:49 -> 00:42:53]  I would assume that they'd be very repetitive again. But I don't know either way, to be honest.
[00:42:58 -> 00:43:06]  Your exam on Tuesday? I thought they're all tomorrow. Yeah, something like that would be
[00:43:06 -> 00:43:13]  nice. So they like to have obviously, I'm sure there'll be something on pH, for example.
[00:43:13 -> 00:43:23]  But what form it will take? You know, we don't know. OCRA. Okay, fair enough.
[00:43:24 -> 00:43:27]  Cool. Lovely. Thanks, guys. Okay, let's have a go at these exam questions then
[00:43:27 -> 00:43:33]  and see if we can whiz them in in the next 10 minutes. So which of the following values
[00:43:35 -> 00:43:38]  for the mass to charge ratio for singly charged ions
[00:43:39 -> 00:43:49]  would be present in the mass spectrum of propanol? CH3, CH2, CHO, but not of propanone? CH3, CHO, CH3.
[00:43:59 -> 00:44:04]  It might be that is one of you maybe doing AS and the other doing A2, perhaps?
[00:44:09 -> 00:44:13]  Yeah, double check exam timetables, guys, and make sure that you look at your date.
[00:44:15 -> 00:44:18]  But I'm sure you're all right. Just make sure you double check just in cases.
[00:44:19 -> 00:44:22]  Okay, anyone got any thoughts about this one? So which of the following values for mass to
[00:44:22 -> 00:44:26]  charge ratio, i.e. the mass, for singly charged ion, i.e. the mass,
[00:44:27 -> 00:44:32]  would be present in the mass spectrum of propanol but not in propanone?
[00:44:32 -> 00:44:41]  Ah, okay, there we go. That might be why. Worth, worth checking.
[00:44:51 -> 00:44:53]  Oh, you did the opposite. Okay, no worries. That's fine.
[00:44:55 -> 00:45:01]  Okay, we reckon B. Why do we reckon B? Absolutely correct, it is B. But why?
[00:45:03 -> 00:45:14]  If I draw them out, it might be easier. So CH3, CH2, C. So propanaldehyde is the
[00:45:15 -> 00:45:19]  carboxylic acid functional group at the end of the chain, including the hydrogen.
[00:45:20 -> 00:45:24]  Nice, that looks good, Josh. And whereas propanone
[00:45:27 -> 00:45:31]  is a ketone, so the carbon algorithm needs to be in the middle of the molecule.
[00:45:31 -> 00:45:40]  CH3, C, double bondo, C, CH3. So we're looking at which functional groups will be present in,
[00:45:42 -> 00:45:45]  will be present in propanaldehyde but not in propanone.
[00:45:45 -> 00:45:52]  So the CH3 will be, so we can ignore A because that will be present in both.
[00:45:52 -> 00:46:08]  And so, however, the 29, the double, double is not a nice way of describing it, the both of
[00:46:08 -> 00:46:14]  the carbons in the same functional group, in the same fragment would not be present in the ketone
[00:46:14 -> 00:46:20]  but will be present in the aldehyde. So it would be that one.
[00:46:24 -> 00:46:31]  Very good. Lovely. What about the second question on this page? Let me know if anyone's not happy,
[00:46:31 -> 00:46:35]  by the way, with any of that. What about the second question though? So two ketones,
[00:46:35 -> 00:46:41]  both have an MR of 86, which peak due to fragmentation into singly charged ions,
[00:46:41 -> 00:46:47]  so we only need to worry about one. Would you expect to be present in the mass spectrum of
[00:46:47 -> 00:46:53]  one but not the other? Again, I'm just going to draw them out because I think I find it helps.
[00:46:55 -> 00:47:05]  So with this one, we've got our CH3, then our C double bondo, then CH2, CH2, then CH3.
[00:47:06 -> 00:47:08]  Speed hydrogens.
[00:47:10 -> 00:47:20]  Or we've got CH3, CH2, then C double bondo, then CH2, CH3. So we've got to work out where might
[00:47:20 -> 00:47:28]  they fragment, which produces different speed hydrogens again. Fragments.
[00:47:29 -> 00:47:33]  Looks promising. So again, what fragment is that representing?
[00:47:34 -> 00:47:37]  Tis C, what fragment is that representing?
[00:47:45 -> 00:47:55]  Yeah, nice. Good. So that section is not possible. You can't, we can get to it,
[00:47:56 -> 00:48:02]  is not possible. You can't, we can get, so that's this one. We can get
[00:48:04 -> 00:48:09]  CH2, CH3 in both of them. We can get CH on its own in both of them.
[00:48:13 -> 00:48:19]  Either end. But what we can't get is the fragment that is CH3, C double bondo. So very nice. Well
[00:48:19 -> 00:48:29]  done. Awesome. Okay. How are we doing for time? Oh, okay. We'll just do these questions and then
[00:48:29 -> 00:48:37]  we might have to disappear. Okay. So it says it is necessary to use several analytical techniques
[00:48:37 -> 00:48:44]  to determine the structure of an unknown compound. An analytical chemist was asked to determine the
[00:48:44 -> 00:48:48]  structure of compound Q, which was found in a waste tank in a mixture of volatile liquids.
[00:48:49 -> 00:48:59]  Compound Q has the molecular formula C4H7ClO, in case you can't read the small writing. It's a
[00:48:59 -> 00:49:04]  volatile liquid, which does not produce misty fumes when added to water. Suggest how a chemist
[00:49:04 -> 00:49:11]  could obtain a sample of Q for analysis from the mixture of volatile liquids. And then identify the
[00:49:11 -> 00:49:17]  bond that causes the major absorption at that peak. Before we answer those questions, I'm just
[00:49:17 -> 00:49:22]  going to say, why is it added? It does not produce misty fumes when added to water. Why has that been
[00:49:22 -> 00:49:28]  included in the question? What is that telling us? Or what can we get from that as a piece of
[00:49:28 -> 00:49:43]  information in our exam question? Does anyone know? So not that it doesn't react with HCl,
[00:49:43 -> 00:49:48]  but it doesn't produce HCl. That's the one, yeah. It doesn't produce HCl when added to water.
[00:49:48 -> 00:49:54]  Very good. Well done. Which means it's not which structure. It's not what kind of compound.
[00:49:54 -> 00:50:01]  Does anybody know? Something, one of the, I think, more interesting, more exciting
[00:50:02 -> 00:50:08]  functional groups that we learn about at A-level chemistry, one of them,
[00:50:08 -> 00:50:14]  is particularly good at producing HCl, which is our misty fumes, when added to water.
[00:50:15 -> 00:50:22]  And that is, well done, really nice, our acyl chloride. So we know that it is not an acyl
[00:50:22 -> 00:50:27]  chloride. Now, this may not be useful to us, because we're not going to go on to do the rest
[00:50:27 -> 00:50:32]  of this question. But I think it's very important to pick up on these clues in exam questions,
[00:50:32 -> 00:50:39]  always really useful. So we know this isn't an acyl chloride. And just a reminder, in case you're
[00:50:39 -> 00:50:44]  not confident, an acyl chloride is the one that looks like a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde,
[00:50:44 -> 00:50:52]  but it's got a chlorine on it as our additional group. Lovely. Cool. Okay. Let's just answer
[00:50:53 -> 00:50:57]  these A and B, and then I'm going to have to disappear. So suggest how the chemist could
[00:50:57 -> 00:51:03]  obtain a sample of Q for analysis from the mixture of volatile liquids. How do we separate
[00:51:03 -> 00:51:09]  out samples from the mixture of volatile liquids? What do we reckon?
[00:51:16 -> 00:51:22]  Can you be more specific, Hallie? What separating technique are you describing?
[00:51:22 -> 00:51:28]  Yeah, good. Good. Lovely. So distillation or fractional distillation. Good. Here's one of our
[00:51:28 -> 00:51:34]  examples. You only actually need to say distillation, but fractional distillation,
[00:51:34 -> 00:51:41]  if you want to. Lovely. Well done. Or you can say gas-liquid chromatography, GLC,
[00:51:41 -> 00:51:46]  which is technically a separation technique. So you can use gas-liquid chromatography,
[00:51:47 -> 00:51:57]  but I think distillation is kind of the easier, more useful answer. Lovely. And then this final
[00:51:57 -> 00:52:02]  question that we'll do today is, the infrared spectrum of Q contains a major absorption at 1724
[00:52:02 -> 00:52:08]  C, and how do we measure that absorption? Well, I'm going to show you how to do that in a minute.
[00:52:08 -> 00:52:13]  So I'm going to show you how to do that in a minute. So I'm going to show you how to do that
[00:52:13 -> 00:52:16]  in a minute. So the infrared spectrum of Q contains a major absorption at 1724
[00:52:16 -> 00:52:21]  centimetres to the minus one. Identify the bond which causes this absorption.
[00:52:22 -> 00:52:26]  Even if we're not sure, we can take a stab because there's only really three
[00:52:27 -> 00:52:35]  bonds that you need to be aware of majorly when you're doing IR spectrometry, spectroscopy.
[00:52:36 -> 00:52:43]  Yeah, good. And it's nearly always going to be a C double bondo. Yeah, good. And actually,
[00:52:43 -> 00:52:47]  if you have your data sheet in front of you, you'll notice that that is it. That is the correct
[00:52:47 -> 00:52:52]  one. So well done. But if you had to guess, it's either going to be a C single bondo,
[00:52:52 -> 00:52:56]  or it's going to be a C double bondo, or it's going to be a C double bond C. Those are only
[00:52:56 -> 00:53:03]  really the peaks that they're ever going to ask you to identify in IR. Then you may be asked to
[00:53:03 -> 00:53:08]  identify the ones, but those are the main ones. So even if you aren't sure you're running out of
[00:53:08 -> 00:53:13]  time, whack one of those down. But really nice. In this case, it is C double bondo.
[00:53:14 -> 00:53:17]  Awesome. Okay. Apologies. We haven't managed to have a go at that exam question, but I'm going
[00:53:17 -> 00:53:21]  to need to disappear off. So we're not going to have time. Lovely. Thank you, Marianne. That's
[00:53:21 -> 00:53:29]  brilliant. So hopefully we have a basic understanding of how mass spectrometry works.
[00:53:29 -> 00:53:32]  If you're AQA, you may need to go and look in a little bit more detail at, for example,
[00:53:32 -> 00:53:38]  the different types of ionisation techniques and applying it in exam questions.
[00:53:40 -> 00:53:45]  We hopefully are all confident at calculating relative masses using mass spectra. So rather
[00:53:45 -> 00:53:52]  than just giving the data, taking it from a spectrum and then calculating it. And hopefully
[00:53:52 -> 00:53:56]  we are confident with determining molecular structures from mass spectra. So looking at
[00:53:56 -> 00:54:01]  those fragmentation patterns, thinking about what our molecular ion peak is telling us, etc.
[00:54:02 -> 00:54:06]  Fantastic. Right. I'm going to have to disappear. So apologies. We didn't have any time for extra
[00:54:06 -> 00:54:11]  questions, but hopefully I'll see you at a future web class. Keep an eye on our timetable to see
[00:54:11 -> 00:54:15]  when we've got web classes coming up. It's been awesome having you here and being so
[00:54:15 -> 00:54:21]  engaging and interactive. That is fabulous. Yes. Really, really good luck to everybody
[00:54:21 -> 00:54:27]  who's got their A levels exams, who are mid exams at the moment, or who've got their exams coming up
[00:54:27 -> 00:54:31]  soon. I've got everything crossed for you. Just make sure you sleep well the night before
[00:54:32 -> 00:54:37]  and stay hydrated and you can only do your best. And I'm sure your best will be brilliant.
[00:54:37 -> 00:54:41]  So really well done. Fantastic, guys. I will see you hopefully very soon. Have a lovely
[00:54:41 -> 00:54:54]  rest of your week and rest of your exam period. And yeah, see you soon. Thank you, guys. Well done.
