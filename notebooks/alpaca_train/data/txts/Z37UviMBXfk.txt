[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  Welcome to our PicMonic webinar series. PicMonic is a powerful multi-sensory study tool to help
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:10]  you remember all the information you need to know in nursing school fast. This pre-recorded live
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:15]  webinar will be a three-part series on pharmacology. But before we get into it,
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:19]  make sure you head to picmonic.com to sign up for a free account. That way you can reference the
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:24]  PicMonics that are talked about in the lecture and continue to use PicMonics to memorize all
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:30]  the topics through to the end class. Now let's join Dr. Wyatt as he teaches us about pharmacology.
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:36]  Today we're going to talk about pharmacology and really just knowing your endings. This webinar is
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:40]  going to be in three parts. Part one, part two, part three. That means three parts. And we're
[00:00:40 -> 00:00:44]  going to kind of talk about different sections in each part. The first part is really kind of how
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:48]  to get started and go over the high yield like hypertensive drugs. The next part, second part,
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:53]  is antibiotics. And third part really is just kind of a hodgepodge of other drugs kind of mixed in
[00:00:53 -> 00:00:59]  there. So let's go and get started. Excuse me. First off, my name is Kendall Wyatt. I am the
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:05]  PicMonics content director. So I manage all the content for everything. I started out as a
[00:01:05 -> 00:01:10]  paramedic, went to nursing school, then went to med school, just finished up. But so that's
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:14]  enough about me. You don't need to know about my stuff. PicMonic takes everything you need to know
[00:01:14 -> 00:01:19]  in nursing school and turns it into fun images. So nursing school, med school, PA school, basically
[00:01:19 -> 00:01:25]  anything medicine. So if you had a bipolar disorder, you could remember it with something
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:29]  like this bipolar bears, which is really handy. We cover lots of different topics for all the
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:35]  things you need to know. So first off, when we talk about this topic today, it's kind of what
[00:01:35 -> 00:01:40]  are we going to do? We're going to talk about medication endings and some antihypertensives
[00:01:40 -> 00:01:44]  in part one. And like I said, part two is antibiotics. Part three is just going to be
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:49]  some other medications kind of in a hodgepodge. And of course, as always, I always have my little
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:56]  magic cup here. One, because my mouth gets dry. Two, because I make three cents every time I
[00:01:56 -> 00:02:02]  shove that off. So whenever you do pharmacology, it's really important not to really drive the
[00:02:02 -> 00:02:07]  home, but it's a lot of memorization. There's tons of medications, so many things to remember. And I
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:12]  can tell you, you can maximize what you're learning just by learning the drug endings. And that's
[00:02:12 -> 00:02:16]  really what we're going to talk about today. All of the images and everything you see in our
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:20]  presentation today are all included on Picmonic's website. You can sign up for a free account at
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:26]  picmonic.com, and there's some links down below. So we're going to talk about, you know, there's
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:29]  so many different medications. We're going to talk about how to identify drug endings and memorize
[00:02:29 -> 00:02:35]  those. And then what you really want to know, we're just memorizing really key points. You don't need
[00:02:35 -> 00:02:41]  to, at least in the nursing level, to master every single tiny little detail. And you don't need to
[00:02:41 -> 00:02:47]  focus on the big things like, does this medication cause nausea or vomiting? Well, almost every
[00:02:47 -> 00:02:54]  medication can cause nausea or upset stomach or GI distress or diarrhea, constipation. But you
[00:02:54 -> 00:02:59]  want to remember the obscure things. Does this medication cause a bowel ileus? Does this medication
[00:02:59 -> 00:03:04]  cause projectile vomiting? Or does it cause a cough? What are the key ones or the signs and
[00:03:04 -> 00:03:08]  symptoms or the side effects, rather, of that particular medication? That's what's really
[00:03:08 -> 00:03:13]  important. When you look at pharmacology and drugs, you need to remember, again, key points.
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:17]  We're going to talk about drug endings today. You need to know the mechanism of action. So depending
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:22]  on what level you're at, if you're, you know, still starting out, you don't need to know great detail
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:27]  on physiology and tiny mechanisms of action. But if you're at a higher provider level or med school
[00:03:27 -> 00:03:31]  or MP, PA, you really need to know those mechanisms of action and all the physiology behind it.
[00:03:32 -> 00:03:36]  You've got to know why you're given the drug indication and those side effects, of course,
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:40]  remembering high yield, key facts, side effects. That's what's important. Considerations are just
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:44]  extra things, some things we're going to talk about today and so that you can remember,
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:46]  because they're important things you need to tell your patients.
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:53]  So let's get started with part one. Part one, we're really going to talk about mostly
[00:03:53 -> 00:03:57]  antihypertensives. We're not going to talk about every single one, but really the highest yield.
[00:03:57 -> 00:04:01]  If there's one thing you must know, no matter what level you're at, you've got to know every
[00:04:01 -> 00:04:04]  detail about these medications. There's no skipping here. So antihypertensives, we've got
[00:04:04 -> 00:04:09]  our ant wearing a tie with our hiker BP character for antihypertensives. And everything you're going
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:16]  to see here is consistent. Now, the first one I like to always start off with is one of my
[00:04:16 -> 00:04:21]  favorites. It's beta blockers. Beta blockers, as soon as I say beta blockers, you should say beta
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:25]  blockers. You should say beta fish, right? And we've got here our character, which is a blue
[00:04:25 -> 00:04:31]  beta fish. Beta fish. Now, the way we're going to talk about staying in line are beta blockers,
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:38]  knowing the drug ending. Well, beta blockers always, a few rare exceptions, and for good reason,
[00:04:38 -> 00:04:45]  end in O-L-O-L. So O-L-O-L, you need to remember that. Well, I like to remember here at Pygmonic,
[00:04:45 -> 00:04:49]  we have our blue beta fish sitting on these blocks for beta blocker. And then we've got,
[00:04:49 -> 00:04:54]  of course, licking a lollipop, a fish with lips licking a lollipop. Oh my goodness, I know,
[00:04:54 -> 00:05:01]  it's just great. I love our little beta fish here, so cute. But just by learning that right there,
[00:05:01 -> 00:05:05]  you can learn tons of different beta blockers. There's so many different ones. Look at this
[00:05:05 -> 00:05:09]  list of beta blockers here. There's so many different ones. And there are a couple of
[00:05:09 -> 00:05:14]  key ones that end in A-L-O-L, which means they have alpha blocking capability as well. But
[00:05:14 -> 00:05:18]  that's not what we're going to stick with today. Learning this, you can immediately learn a beta
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:22]  blocker. Now, there's one thing you should be thinking about. When I say beta blockers,
[00:05:22 -> 00:05:27]  what do you need to be thinking about when I say beta blockers? What is the one thing you need to
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:34]  monitor or worry or watch for when I say beta blockers? I say beta blockers. You say heart rate.
[00:05:34 -> 00:05:38]  That's right. You really got to worry about monitoring the heart rate because beta blockers
[00:05:38 -> 00:05:44]  cause a beta block. And one of the things where we have a beta receptor block is for heart rate.
[00:05:44 -> 00:05:48]  Now, here's our beta blockers, Pygmonic. You can learn this inside of our learning system.
[00:05:48 -> 00:05:53]  Lots of different things here. But beta blockers, again, a beta fish on blocks with a lollipop,
[00:05:53 -> 00:05:58]  to remember that ending. We use beta blockers for hypertension or hyper BP, heart failure,
[00:05:58 -> 00:06:04]  and angina, our little angel guy here. So you can remember that. And what you need to do is
[00:06:04 -> 00:06:09]  always check the heart rate. Now, I always get a nurse that would come to me and say,
[00:06:10 -> 00:06:14]  well, if I get a low heart rate, I can't tell that patient not to take their medication. And
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:19]  you're right. At the nursing level, you can't say stop taking your medication. But you can tell them
[00:06:19 -> 00:06:24]  to hold a dose and you can notify the provider. Anybody who's a practitioner would just say,
[00:06:24 -> 00:06:28]  stop the medication. Or maybe we need to lower the dose or switch you to a different type of
[00:06:28 -> 00:06:33]  medication. All of these medications, beta blockers, there's a big one. What do we need
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:37]  to monitor for? What do we need to be worried about with a patient who's on beta blockers?
[00:06:37 -> 00:06:44]  Well, we need to be worried about the fact that heart rate, number one, but also be worried about
[00:06:44 -> 00:06:50]  the fact that beta blockers can mask the signs of hypoglycemia. So we've got our little masked
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:54]  hippo glue bottle right here inside of Picmonic, just a little cute little nugget right there.
[00:06:54 -> 00:06:58]  And what are those signs and symptoms? Well, beta blockers block beta receptors. And when
[00:06:58 -> 00:07:03]  they block beta receptors, they prevent the release of epinephrine. And that prevention
[00:07:03 -> 00:07:09]  of epinephrine, when you get a low blood sugar, your body throws out a bunch of epinephrine. And
[00:07:09 -> 00:07:14]  when it throws out that epinephrine, it causes those systemic symptoms. What are they? Well,
[00:07:14 -> 00:07:19]  that's going to have a little bit of tachycardia, which is beta blocker blocks. You're going to have
[00:07:20 -> 00:07:24]  a little bit of sweating, a little bit of diaphoresis. And you're not going to get
[00:07:24 -> 00:07:29]  those symptoms without that epinephrine because of the beta blocker. So it masks those signs of
[00:07:29 -> 00:07:33]  hypoglycemia you need to remember. Also important not to give a beta blocker in a patient with a
[00:07:33 -> 00:07:36]  heart block. We've got our heart with blocks here wrapped in caution tape. Or for asthma,
[00:07:36 -> 00:07:41]  because it can cause bronchoconstriction. Just important points. All of the drugs,
[00:07:41 -> 00:07:46]  almost every drug really, you never really want to stop them cold turkey. And all these ones we're
[00:07:46 -> 00:07:51]  going to talk about, you'd want to taper them down or switch them to another medication. In general,
[00:07:51 -> 00:07:55]  it's a bad idea to stop any medication right away. But there's a couple that you need to remember to
[00:07:55 -> 00:08:02]  taper as well, like steroids. So let's get started with the next one that I like. And that's ACE
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:08]  inhibitors. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Now, if you don't understand
[00:08:08 -> 00:08:13]  the renin-angiotensin system, well, I'm sorry. No, I'm just kidding. You can go check out our
[00:08:13 -> 00:08:16]  other webinar. We've got one on renal or lots of picmonics on renal. Tons of different things
[00:08:16 -> 00:08:20]  help you learn all those and all the drugs. But we're just going to talk about ACE inhibitors
[00:08:20 -> 00:08:24]  first. ACE inhibitors. Now, ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme, is in the lung, right?
[00:08:24 -> 00:08:31]  That's right. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin
[00:08:31 -> 00:08:36]  one to angiotensin two. So when I say ACE inhibitors, here we've got our wonderful
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:41]  little character, our ACE card with inhibiting chains. And we've got what? Well, we've got our
[00:08:41 -> 00:08:49]  little pearls because ACE inhibitors end in pril. That's right. So ACE inhibitors end in pril. So
[00:08:49 -> 00:08:53]  we've got the fun little pearls here with our ACE card with inhibiting chains. I mean, little
[00:08:53 -> 00:09:00]  ACE card just got the little chain there. Poor little thing. Anyway, so ACE inhibitors, you need
[00:09:00 -> 00:09:04]  to remember pril, P-R-I-L. So you're going to learn lots of different ACE inhibitors just by memorizing
[00:09:04 -> 00:09:09]  the drug ending. But if I say ACE inhibitors, the first thing that should roll out of your mouth is
[00:09:09 -> 00:09:12]  what side effect do we have to watch for right away? I mean, it should be at the tip of your
[00:09:12 -> 00:09:20]  tongue. You should be spitting it out. Cough. That's right. Cough. A dry cough. ACE inhibitors,
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:30]  because of the inhibiting ACE, it also inhibits bradykinin. And bradykinin basically causes a
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:36]  decrease of secretions or a decrease. It allows for irritation basically in the throat and can
[00:09:36 -> 00:09:41]  cause this dry cough. That's a number one reason we need to look for. It's a very high yield
[00:09:41 -> 00:09:46]  question. And we'd want to switch them to another type of medication. A really common thing is a
[00:09:46 -> 00:09:51]  patient who has an ACE inhibitor, if they get that dry cough, we're going to switch them to another
[00:09:51 -> 00:09:55]  medication. But before we do that, let's take a look at our ACE inhibitor picmonic. So you can
[00:09:55 -> 00:10:00]  take a look here. Here's our ACE card. Again, our little Rennin wrench character and our raspberries
[00:10:00 -> 00:10:04]  for an angiotensin system. But what are the other side effects of ACE inhibitors? Well,
[00:10:04 -> 00:10:09]  anytime you give an ACE inhibitor, an antihypertensive, you worry about the opposite
[00:10:09 -> 00:10:14]  effect of what you're giving it for. So you may have hypotension or hippo BP. There's that coughing
[00:10:14 -> 00:10:19]  coffee pot right there with his dry mouth to help you remember. Cough for ACE inhibitors with pearls
[00:10:19 -> 00:10:24]  on the table for prill. Other things we see are hyperkalemia, our hiker banana character,
[00:10:24 -> 00:10:29]  and sometimes we'll see angioedema, but not so common with ACE inhibitors.
[00:10:30 -> 00:10:34]  Other thing we're going to see with ACE inhibitors is a first dose effect. So very first dose. So
[00:10:34 -> 00:10:39]  here we've got our slow turtle standing sort of slow position changes because you get that first
[00:10:39 -> 00:10:42]  dose effect where you may have a little bit of syncope on rising. So you want to tell them to
[00:10:42 -> 00:10:48]  raise that real slow. The next medication type after ACE inhibitors, if you had an ACE inhibitor
[00:10:48 -> 00:10:54]  and you needed to switch, you're going to get switched to an ARB or an angiotensin receptor
[00:10:54 -> 00:10:59]  blocker or angiotensin 2 receptor blocker, which is why we call them ARBs. It's such a mouthful,
[00:10:59 -> 00:11:05]  so many, so many words. So ARBs are another type of medication and you need to remember those by
[00:11:05 -> 00:11:12]  ending by what drug ending? Well, sartin, low sartin, candesartin, valsartin, omelsartin,
[00:11:12 -> 00:11:15]  or whatever other sartins they make. There's too many. They're going to make some new sartins
[00:11:15 -> 00:11:21]  tomorrow and you're just going to have to remember that one too, right? No, you're going to be able
[00:11:21 -> 00:11:26]  to just remember the drug ending. I don't know of any other sartins that aren't angiotensin receptor
[00:11:26 -> 00:11:31]  blockers. So easy to remember. And you can remember this with this crazy image here of our
[00:11:31 -> 00:11:39]  angel tennis receptor blocker here, angel tutu wearing receptor. My mouth is so tongue-tied
[00:11:40 -> 00:11:47]  but this angel playing tennis with her little receptor blocks and she's wearing a tutu,
[00:11:47 -> 00:11:51]  so for angiotensin 2 receptor blocker. But most importantly, you can remember this little
[00:11:51 -> 00:11:56]  Spartan character that he's playing with to help you remember sartins and that's what's
[00:11:56 -> 00:12:00]  really going to help you. So you can remember those endings. Now, when I say angiotensin
[00:12:00 -> 00:12:03]  receptor blockers or ARBs, what's the thing you need to worry about, that side effect on the tip
[00:12:03 -> 00:12:09]  of your tongue? Well, the first one, the big one we see a lot is really just remembering angioedema.
[00:12:09 -> 00:12:15]  So angioedema, possible with ACE inhibitors, yes, but very possible with angiotensin receptor
[00:12:15 -> 00:12:19]  blockers. And here we've got our little angel edamame with lips. See that edamame little
[00:12:19 -> 00:12:28]  thing right there, just so cute and big. Why are we doing that? Well, because that's what
[00:12:28 -> 00:12:32]  usually where you see angioedema. You usually see it in the lips. It's usually swelling in the lips
[00:12:32 -> 00:12:40]  and you end up with those. That's right. You're not going to forget that, right? I know.
[00:12:41 -> 00:12:45]  Yeah, I know. Just play it back and watch it again and again. I don't mind. Anyway,
[00:12:45 -> 00:12:50]  that's what you worry about, angioedema, that swelling and dilation of the face,
[00:12:50 -> 00:12:56]  a medical emergency for sure. Of course, other things, we worry about a lot of these types of
[00:12:56 -> 00:13:01]  medications because we don't want to use them in pregnancy or they're cautioned in pregnancy
[00:13:01 -> 00:13:08]  for sure. Definitely a second line medication. Or renal artery stenosis. Here we've got our little
[00:13:08 -> 00:13:13]  stone kidney vessel character for renal artery stenosis. Now, the next medication type I want
[00:13:13 -> 00:13:18]  to talk about, another type or class of medications are calcium channel blockers.
[00:13:18 -> 00:13:22]  I love calcium channel blockers because I just love this cute little cow.
[00:13:22 -> 00:13:25]  But anyway, calcium channel blockers, there's several different types. I'm going to talk about
[00:13:25 -> 00:13:30]  those in a sec. But calcium channel blockers, as far as an antihypertensive, you need to remember
[00:13:30 -> 00:13:38]  the dipines, nifedipine, amlodipine, nifedipine. That's right. You need to remember those right
[00:13:38 -> 00:13:43]  there. Now, with those, you can remember the dipines, calcium channel blockers, and you can
[00:13:43 -> 00:13:50]  remember that those, this little cow character, right? Our calcium calcified cow with these
[00:13:50 -> 00:13:54]  little blocks. And of course, they're dipping their little chips. So, dipines, you can help
[00:13:54 -> 00:14:00]  remember. So, the big thing to know with these is that when we talk about calcium channel blockers,
[00:14:00 -> 00:14:03]  especially if you're super smart, you would say, oh, well, that's not the only type of
[00:14:03 -> 00:14:06]  calcium channel blocker. I'd say, oh, well, that means you're right. You're so smart.
[00:14:08 -> 00:14:11]  So, there are three different classes of calcium channel blockers. There's the ones for
[00:14:11 -> 00:14:14]  hypertension, which are the dipines, the dihydropyridines. You don't need to know that
[00:14:14 -> 00:14:20]  dihydropyridines so much. But they're just the dipines. The other ones are the phenylalkamines.
[00:14:20 -> 00:14:24]  The phenylalkamines are verapamil. That's another one you've probably heard of. And the
[00:14:24 -> 00:14:29]  benzothiopines, which is diltiazem. Now, why do we use, why is there three different classes?
[00:14:29 -> 00:14:34]  Well, the easiest way to remember is that the dipines are for hypertension and that,
[00:14:34 -> 00:14:41]  those are definitely vasoselective. Whereas, verapamil and diltiazem are cardioselective
[00:14:41 -> 00:14:45]  or cardioselective and vasoselective. You know, they work on cardiac and the vessels,
[00:14:45 -> 00:14:50]  but mostly cardioselective. So, they're going to work on the heart. So, why do we use diltiazem?
[00:14:50 -> 00:14:55]  Oh, I just don't know. I just can't remember. I just, I've got this diltazer and this v-wrapper
[00:14:55 -> 00:14:59]  in this, in this image. I just don't know why we use it. Well, that's why we have big monics.
[00:14:59 -> 00:15:03]  They help you remember everything. Diltiazem is a cardioselective calcium channel blocker.
[00:15:03 -> 00:15:10]  We block calcium channels. We stop excitability. We slow it down. We calm it down. Calm down,
[00:15:10 -> 00:15:16]  calcium. You don't need to get so excited. Getting all those channels excited. So, we usually see
[00:15:16 -> 00:15:22]  diltiazem used in atrial fibrillation for rate control. Verapamil, we see often sometimes used
[00:15:22 -> 00:15:26]  in the same type of way. And of course, the dihydropyridines, the dipines, we use for
[00:15:30 -> 00:15:34]  blood pressure. I'm so tongue-tied today. Probably because I'm talking so fast,
[00:15:34 -> 00:15:39]  but luckily you can just play it over again. Anyway, here's our calcium channel blockers
[00:15:39 -> 00:15:43]  picmonic. So, we've got our diltazer and our v-wrapper up here at the top with this
[00:15:43 -> 00:15:50]  calcified calc blocked. Now, when I say amlodipine, nifedipine, and I talk about one
[00:15:50 -> 00:15:54]  of those calcium channel blockers, what's the number one side effect you should be looking for?
[00:15:54 -> 00:15:58]  Especially, no matter what level you're at, you should be looking for this common side effect.
[00:15:58 -> 00:16:02]  What is it? Oh my goodness, I don't know. Hypotension? No, that's not the one I'm
[00:16:02 -> 00:16:07]  going to be trying to give you. That's the easy answer. If I'm giving you a medication
[00:16:07 -> 00:16:13]  for blood pressure, obviously a side effect is low blood pressure. Duh, right? That's not the
[00:16:13 -> 00:16:17]  one you're going to get. You're usually going to get peripheral edema. We see it all the time,
[00:16:17 -> 00:16:22]  peripheral edema. If you're on a calcium channel blocker for hypertension and you end up with this
[00:16:22 -> 00:16:26]  constant peripheral edema or edema in the legs, it's probably because of the calcium channel
[00:16:26 -> 00:16:34]  blocker. Super common. See it all the time. Now, the other one that we see, when we use
[00:16:34 -> 00:16:40]  diltiazem or especially verapamil, verapamil by itself usually causes what? Verapamil, we see,
[00:16:40 -> 00:16:45]  causes constipation. That's another side effect. We've got the little CortCon toilet here inside
[00:16:45 -> 00:16:50]  of our image, and gingival hyperplasia. The only other time you see gingival hyperplasia,
[00:16:50 -> 00:16:56]  you should be thinking about seizure-type medications. That's right. Of course,
[00:16:56 -> 00:17:01]  any type of calcium channel blocker can slow the heart rate down, but you want to worry about with
[00:17:01 -> 00:17:04]  those dihydropyridines. You want to worry about that peripheral edema, because that's really
[00:17:04 -> 00:17:08]  common. Now, the next thing I want to talk about are loop diuretics. Now, I'm not going to talk
[00:17:08 -> 00:17:12]  about all the types of diuretics, because we've got that literally in our renal webinar. There's
[00:17:12 -> 00:17:15]  a whole ... We go through every single one of them, but we're just going to talk about loop
[00:17:15 -> 00:17:24]  diuretics first. Now, loop diuretics are fun, because we've got our di-rocket spewing out urine
[00:17:24 -> 00:17:28]  or yellow fluid. If you don't want to say the word urine out loud, if it makes you nervous,
[00:17:28 -> 00:17:34]  or you just say poop or something, and then you freak out, maybe you go to a naughty place or a
[00:17:34 -> 00:17:38]  bad place in your mind. You're just in the fetal position crying. But anyway, loop diuretics.
[00:17:39 -> 00:17:43]  Here we've got our loop hin. Now, what's important? Now, really, this is kind of a
[00:17:43 -> 00:17:49]  stretch for us on the ending, because it's not really a drug ending for all loop diuretics,
[00:17:49 -> 00:17:53]  but I just want to talk the few ones you're going to get. You're going to see semide,
[00:17:53 -> 00:17:57]  S-E-M-I-D-E, and that's where you've got furosemide and torsemide. I've got these other
[00:17:57 -> 00:18:02]  two here in red, because they're different. But furosemide, or Lasix, don't use that
[00:18:03 -> 00:18:07]  trade name. Always remember the generic name. Always remember that, really important.
[00:18:08 -> 00:18:15]  So we've got our loop di-rocket hin on this semi-truck spewing out urine. And why is it
[00:18:15 -> 00:18:20]  spewing out so much urine? Because loops are very powerful diuretics. Now, just really quick,
[00:18:21 -> 00:18:25]  ethocrinic acid. I mean, that's such a weird one. Well, let's just talk about why you need
[00:18:25 -> 00:18:30]  to remember the different one. Why is ethocrinic acid, why is it different? Because it's spelled
[00:18:30 -> 00:18:35]  differently? Because it's two words? I mean, I don't know. Well, the reason is because
[00:18:35 -> 00:18:39]  ethocrinic acid is literally a loop diuretic, but it's the weird one. Remember, it's a weird
[00:18:39 -> 00:18:43]  name, and it has a weird name for the reason, in my opinion. And I remember that as a weird name,
[00:18:43 -> 00:18:49]  because it doesn't have salt. You can give it to a person with a sulfa allergy. There's no
[00:18:49 -> 00:18:54]  sulfa allergy interaction. Whereas loop diuretics, you can't give to a patient who has a sulfa
[00:18:54 -> 00:19:02]  allergy. Really common question we see. So here's our loop diuretic picmonics. Now,
[00:19:02 -> 00:19:05]  I'm not going to go through each of the details, but there's a couple of really important points
[00:19:05 -> 00:19:10]  when we talk about giving loop diuretics. The first off are that when we give any diuretic,
[00:19:10 -> 00:19:13]  it basically makes you pee a lot, right? I mean, you're urinating more. And when you're
[00:19:13 -> 00:19:22]  urinating more, you're losing more things. Now, I always love loops lose everything.
[00:19:22 -> 00:19:26]  And when I say loops lose everything, I mean you're peeing out all those electrolytes.
[00:19:26 -> 00:19:31]  You're peeing out everything. And what's that little, volatile, scaredy electrolyte that just
[00:19:31 -> 00:19:35]  gets so scared and gets all out of whack every single time? Which one is it? Oh,
[00:19:35 -> 00:19:40]  a scaredy electrolyte. I don't know. Potassium. And I always just like to remember potassium.
[00:19:40 -> 00:19:45]  Potassium's in bananas. Bananas go so bad so quick. You know a weirdo that doesn't like to eat
[00:19:45 -> 00:19:50]  a brown banana. Actually, I do. It's Marley. She works here at Picmonic with me,
[00:19:50 -> 00:19:54]  and she loves brown bananas. What a freak. Who wants to eat brown bananas? Oh, you can send
[00:19:54 -> 00:19:58]  them here to the Picmonic office, and Marley will eat them if you get some brown bananas.
[00:19:58 -> 00:20:04]  Fine. Anyway, with that, little volatile electrolyte. And with that, you pee out
[00:20:04 -> 00:20:09]  extra potassium. We see it with loops. But loops lose everything. Remember that. Loops
[00:20:09 -> 00:20:13]  lose everything. So you're going to pee out potassium first. It's going to be the first
[00:20:13 -> 00:20:17]  one you're going to pee out because it's a scaredy electrolyte. Then you're going to see
[00:20:17 -> 00:20:23]  loops losing calcium. That's really, really important. Loops lose calcium. So loops lose
[00:20:23 -> 00:20:27]  calcium. Why do I tell you that? Well, it pees out everything because I'm going to talk about
[00:20:27 -> 00:20:31]  the difference in a second. Now, with loop diuretics, if you're giving them for a long
[00:20:31 -> 00:20:36]  period of time or a high-dose IV, what do we worry about? What's a thing we're going to be
[00:20:36 -> 00:20:40]  watching for? We're going to be watching for, looking for out there, like, what's going on?
[00:20:40 -> 00:20:44]  I don't know. Well, we're going to be watching for ototoxicity. I'm going to pull my shirt down.
[00:20:44 -> 00:20:51]  Sorry. Ototoxicity. Ototoxicity. What does ototoxicity mean? Toxic ears? Yes, we've got
[00:20:51 -> 00:20:56]  our toxic green glow here inside of our pygmonic. But you're going to be worried about tinnitus or
[00:20:56 -> 00:21:00]  ringing of the ears. That's going to be that sign for a patient who's on potassium. I mean,
[00:21:00 -> 00:21:08]  sorry, a loop diuretic drip or getting a high-dose IV. So with all this, lots of things to go with
[00:21:08 -> 00:21:12]  loop diuretics. What's the big thing we're going to worry about next? What's the next type of
[00:21:12 -> 00:21:18]  diuretic we want to talk about? Well, that's going to be thiazide diuretics. Now, we're going
[00:21:18 -> 00:21:22]  to talk about thiazide diuretics at the second, but remember that thiazide diuretics are different
[00:21:22 -> 00:21:27]  because they don't lose calcium. That's why we remember, if you remember that loops lose
[00:21:27 -> 00:21:32]  everything, loops lose calcium. So you have hypocalcemia, whereas thiazide diuretic,
[00:21:32 -> 00:21:37]  no change. So that's it for part one. We're really just moving straight on to part two.
[00:21:37 -> 00:21:41]  It's no different for me, but if you're switching videos, you need to switch over to part two.
