[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  rules of thumb that I'd like you to take away from this. First, don't have debt
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:10]  rise faster than income because your debt burdens will eventually crush you.
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:15]  Second, don't have income rise faster than productivity because you'll
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:22]  eventually become uncompetitive. And third, do all that you can to raise your
[00:00:22 -> 00:00:27]  productivity because in the long run that's what matters most. This is simple
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:32]  advice for you and it's simple advice for policy makers. You might be surprised
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:38]  but most people, including most policy makers, don't pay enough attention to
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:44]  this. This template has worked for me and I hope it will work for you.
