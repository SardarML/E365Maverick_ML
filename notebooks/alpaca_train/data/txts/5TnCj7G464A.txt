[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  Carbohydrates are energy, but how many carbs do you need and what are the best sources
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:07]  of energy for performance?
[00:00:07 -> 00:00:09]  Watch now for these answers and more.
[00:00:09 -> 00:00:12]  Hi, I'm sports dietitian Tara Collingwood.
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:15]  Carbohydrates are your body's preferred source of energy.
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:20]  Our body needs carbs all day long, especially if you exercise on a regular basis.
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:25]  Carbs are an integral part of an athletic diet and should be consumed before and after
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:26]  exercise.
[00:00:26 -> 00:00:31]  Start within an hour of getting up with some carbs in a smoothie or maybe some cereal.
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:35]  Make sure that you have those carbs with every meal and even at snack time.
[00:00:35 -> 00:00:41]  Choose carb-containing foods like nutrient-dense whole grain bread, cereal, tortillas, rice,
[00:00:41 -> 00:00:46]  pasta, potatoes, vegetables, dairy, and of course, fruit.
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:50]  Fruit is a great option for a pre-workout snack, whether it's fresh, canned, dried,
[00:00:50 -> 00:00:52]  like raisins or dates.
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:57]  When you're doing moderate to intense exercise lasting an hour or longer, you may need small
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:01]  amounts of carbs throughout your workout, such as a few gulps of a sports drink or a
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:06]  few bites of fruit every 15 to 20 minutes during that exercise.
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:08]  Post-workout eating is essential.
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:13]  Skipping that post-workout snack on a regular basis could actually impact your fitness goals.
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:18]  So aim for refueling within about 15 to 60 minutes after exercise.
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:23]  Building these healthy habits include choosing foods that have both carbs and protein, like
[00:01:23 -> 00:01:28]  yogurt with fruit and granola, cheese and whole grain crackers, or an apple with some
[00:01:28 -> 00:01:29]  nut butter.
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:33]  My favorite way to refuel after exercise is drinking low-fat chocolate milk because it
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:38]  has that perfect mix of protein and carbs that helps to refuel those exhausted muscles,
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:43]  but also helps your body return to peak potential.
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:48]  The number of carbs you eat per day will depend on your resting metabolism and how many calories
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:50]  you're burning throughout the day.
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:55]  As a general rule, try to fill half your plate with fruits and veggies, about a quarter grains,
[00:01:55 -> 00:01:56]  and a quarter with protein.
[00:01:56 -> 00:02:01]  And remember to include those three servings of dairy each day as part of your meals and
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:02]  snacks.
