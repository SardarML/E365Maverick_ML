[00:00:00 -> 00:00:08]  Gears are mechanical components used to transmit power and motion through the successive engagement
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:15]  of their peripheral teeth. Gears perform certain key functions within machines and assemblies,
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:23]  such as reversing the direction of rotation or altering the angular orientation of rotary
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:31]  motion. Gears are also used to convert rotary motion into linear motion and vice versa,
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:41]  or to alter gear speed ratios. The methods of machining gears can be classified into two
[00:00:41 -> 00:00:51]  primary categories, gear generating and gear form cutting. Many of the processes used to machine
[00:00:51 -> 00:01:00]  gears may also be used to finish gears. Gear generating involves gear cutting through the
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:07]  relative motion between a rotating cutting tool and the generating motion or rotation of the
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:18]  workpiece. The primary gear generating processes include hobbing and shaping. In hobbing, gear
[00:01:19 -> 00:01:25]  teeth are progressively generated by a series of cuts using a helically fluted cutting tool called
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:34]  a hob. Both the hob and the gear blank rotate as the hob is fed axially across the face of the
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:41]  blank. Hobbing is the principal method for producing spur gears and helical gears and
[00:01:41 -> 00:01:49]  also used to produce many special gear forms. The main limitation of hobbing is that it can
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:58]  only be used to produce external gears. Hobbing can be performed on a single gear blank but also
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:07]  allows for the stacking of workpieces to increase production rates. Shaping generates gear teeth by
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:13]  rotating the workpiece in contact with a reciprocating cutter. The reciprocating
[00:02:13 -> 00:02:21]  cutter may be a pinion-shaped cutter, a multi-tooth rack-shaped cutter, or a single
[00:02:21 -> 00:02:29]  point cutter. The pinion-shaped cutter's axis is parallel to the gear blank and begins cutting by
[00:02:29 -> 00:02:35]  reciprocating while feeding gradually into the blank to a predetermined cutting depth.
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:43]  The cutter and gear blank rotate slowly at the same pitch circle velocity as the cutter enters
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:51]  and exits the cut, incrementally generating the gear teeth. Rack-shaped cutters typically have
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:59]  between 6 to 12 teeth that reciprocate into the gear blank. Once the rack cutter finishes a pass,
[00:02:59 -> 00:03:05]  the cutter is disengaged and returns to a starting point to begin cutting again.
[00:03:05 -> 00:03:12]  When shaping with a single point cutter, the cutter reciprocates, making successively deeper
[00:03:12 -> 00:03:19]  cuts until a predetermined depth is reached. Gear shapers are used to make internal gears,
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:27]  shoulder gears, and many other gear types that cannot be produced with hobbers. Shapers can
[00:03:27 -> 00:03:36]  also produce non-involute shapes, such as a cam and gear on the same shaft. Gear form cutting
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:44]  typically involves the use of formed tooth cutters that have the desired gear shape or profile. The
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:55]  primary gear form cutting processes include broaching and milling. Broaching is the fastest
[00:03:55 -> 00:04:01]  method of machining gears and is performed on many different machine types using a multi-tooth
[00:04:01 -> 00:04:10]  cutting tool called a broach. The broach or the gear blank are pushed or pulled relative to each
[00:04:10 -> 00:04:16]  other to remove material. Each tooth on the broach is generally higher than the preceding
[00:04:16 -> 00:04:23]  tooth. As a result, the depth of cut increases with each tooth as the broaching operation
[00:04:23 -> 00:04:32]  progresses. The conventional method of broaching is used mainly to produce internal gears. For
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:40]  external gears, pot broaching is used. Pot broaching is performed on special machine tools having a
[00:04:40 -> 00:04:47]  hollow broaching tool assembly called the pot. Gear blanks are either pushed down, pushed up,
[00:04:47 -> 00:04:57]  or pulled up through the pot to generate the gear teeth. Milling is a machining process that
[00:04:57 -> 00:05:03]  uses the relative motion between a rotating multi-edge cutter and the workpiece to generate
[00:05:03 -> 00:05:11]  gear shapes. Milled gears are typically produced using cutters that mill each gear tooth space
[00:05:11 -> 00:05:19]  individually. To produce large coarse pitch internal or external spur, bevel, or helical
[00:05:19 -> 00:05:27]  gears, a process called gashing can be used on heavy-duty milling machines. Gashing involves
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:35]  plunging the rotating cutter into a blank for rapid metal removal. After machining,
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:42]  gears may require heat treatment to meet hardness requirements. After heat treating,
[00:05:42 -> 00:05:50]  gears usually require finishing to nullify any distortion that may occur. In some cases,
[00:05:50 -> 00:05:59]  gears are machined and finished before heat treatment, and then once processed,
[00:05:59 -> 00:06:03]  surface finished to remove distortion from the heat treatment.
