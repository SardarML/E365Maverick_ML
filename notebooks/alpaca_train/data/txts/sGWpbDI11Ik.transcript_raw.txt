 Hey, what's up guys today? I'm starting a new video series that I'm calling linguistics 101  and this is a series that I'm really excited about because  Linguistics is something that I'm really interested in and really passionate about and it's something that not a whole lot of people have a good  understanding about  But it is an area that will really help your language learning if you start to understand the basic concepts of linguistics  Now this first video in the series is just going to be a basic overview  introduction of linguistics in general and then in subsequent videos  I'll start to get more specific into the some of the more specific sub areas of linguistics  This is something that several of you have been asking me about  you've been asking for a video that explains some basic linguistic principles for everyday people and  That's what I'm gonna try to do with this series  Most of you know, if you've been watching this channel for a while, you know that I am a student of linguistics at  University of Wisconsin Milwaukee  And so I'm really excited about this series because I think it's gonna help you learn a lot  Now before we can get started  We have to talk about what is linguistics?  Linguistics is the scientific study of human language  And we study how what is language what makes it up what makes one language different from another language  How does it work? What are the component parts behind the logic that you don't normally think about when you're speaking?  But it's in there in your brain a lot of things that you just say naturally and you can't explain  Why you say things that way?  these are the things that linguists study and  Importantly  Linguists also study how we can better use language for our purposes because language is something that exists in  all  domains of human existence  If you are human you have language and you use it every day and you use it in everything that you do. So  Learning how to better use language and how to better understand language is gonna be a huge benefit to everything you do  and first I'm gonna do videos on the various branches of  Linguistics and so I'm gonna make a separate video for each one of these subfields and maybe even more  Starting with phonetics, which is the study of human speech sounds  Now phonetics study is what you do with your tongue your mouth your lips and your lungs in order to produce speech sounds  It also studies  The properties of how those speech sounds travel through the air via sound waves  Phonology is the study of how speech sounds are used within a given language  You can say it's the grammar of speech sounds  Morphology is the study of words and how words are formed using various root words  Prefixes suffixes how they all relate to one another  and  How they to some extent how they're used in sentences  Syntax is the study of sentence structure and how words are arranged within a sentence to mean different things  Semantics is the study of meaning. So why do our words mean what they mean?  Pragmatics is the study of how humans use context to understand speech  Which is very important if you're learning a foreign language, especially if it's from a very different culture from your own  You're gonna need to rely on context a lot and there's a scientific study about how that's done  Linguistic descriptivism. All right, we can't start a  series on  linguistics without talking about prescriptivism versus descriptivism  Linguists are  Descriptivists meaning that they're only worried about describing the way human speech actually  occurs and the underlying  form of that language  That we have subconsciously in our brains  This contrasts with  prescriptivism  which  You've probably know all kinds of people that are prescriptivists  and  They try to tell you that there is a right and a wrong way to speak  You should try to speak in the right way and you should avoid speaking in the wrong way  so they're prescribing a certain way of speaking and  The more you think about this the more you study it the more you realize that  Prescriptivism just does not make sense  So linguists are descriptivists were only worried about describing language in the way that it actually exists  And a common  Thought experiment in linguistics is  The Martian, okay  If a Martian scientist came down to earth and heard the following two sentences spoken by a native speaker  Which one would he consider to be an error and this is assuming that the Martian is a good scientist and  He's done a lot of observation of English and he has written down the rules that define the English language  So he hears one person say I ain't never done that before  Meaning of course, I have never done that then the Martian hears someone else say do you want a botter waddle?  Intending to mean do you want a water bottle and the reason that I wrote this down here is because I actually had a  Friend say that to me one time  She was asking me if I wanted a water bottle and it just came out all wrong. Do you want a bottle?  I want a bottle well  All right. So which of these two sentences would the Martian consider to be an error?  The answer is number two  number sentence one is  perfectly grammatical  it's  The Martian would listen to that and he would say I hear people say that all the time. This is fine  This is just the way these humans speak and there's nothing wrong with that sentence. It's perfectly formed  He would say sentence number two is clearly an error, right  She meant to say one thing and she accidentally said something else the first guy. He said that on purpose  He said exactly what he meant to say. It's not an error. So there is a grammatical and there is  Non-grammatical  But  grammatical sentence simply means a sentence that would be spoken naturally by a native speaker  And since native speakers say things like I ain't never done that  That's a grammatical sentence because native speakers don't  Purposely say things like do you want a bottle not a grammatical sentence?  So that's the difference  Before we talk about  Studying language. We have to do a little bit of thinking about what language is and it's important to keep in mind that language is  different from literacy  Okay, all mentally healthy healthy people develop language as long as they're exposed to it  Children develop language before they're able to read and write  So there's a period of time where every one of us was able to speak but we were not literate. Okay, they're separate  Tribes living in the jungle with no dictionaries. No writing. No pens. No paper  They're able to speak and they spend their entire lives able to speak but not able to write so writing systems spelling  Dictionaries grammar books. These are not  important to a language  They have some relations some connection  But they're separate and you have to keep them separate because this tribe that lives in the jungle they speak  rule bound grammar there are  There are rules to the language that they speak those rules were just never taught in English class. They acquired them naturally  What is language continued all right language behaves in ways that literacy does not  No one naturally acquires literacy  You have to go to school to learn how to read and write and it takes years of practice and you have to do  Exercises and you have to first learn to write your letters and then learn to write  simple words and you have to take spelling tests if you  are you know, if you belong to a  if you speak a language that is  Not spelled the way it's pronounced. Sorry. My computer's about to die. I gotta plug this in really quick  Literacy is not naturally acquired  Language is so if a mentally healthy child is exposed to language  He doesn't have you don't have to try to teach him that language on the contrary  There's nothing you can do to prevent him from learning that language  Language evolves much faster than writing. So take the word night for example as in the Knights of the Roundtable  once upon a time this word was pronounced as  Knee-knee and the people who devised the writing system for the English language  They this is how they pronounced the word they listened to the way that they pronounced the words and then they wrote down  Exactly the way that they thought it should be spelt  so the word for them leaked  Began with  K and it had a G and an H in it fast-forward several hundred years  Like I said language is always changing and there's nothing that can be done to stop it. Well the pronunciation of the word  leaked  transform into night  And the writing system because it's easier to preserve writing than it is to preserve  Sound waves the writing system stayed the same  Which is an example of the way that language evolves  Leaving behind the writing and that's why we have so many weird spellings in our language these days because  We you know, they codified the spelling and then we left that behind as the language evolved, but the spelling didn't  Alright literates literary  literary  Literate societies are more prone to prescriptivism  That's because  you know in the West where we  We go to school and learn how to spell and we learn proper grammar and we take English classes  It's  Just almost inevitable that we would grow up believing that there is a right and a wrong way to speak and that you should  Avoid the wrong way  Well, if you grew up in a desert island where you never saw a pencil pencil on paper  You never saw a grammar book. You never saw a dictionary and  You never saw a dictionary and  All you did is you just learned the language the way your parents speak then you would have no concept that your your parents speak  wrong  Even right even if they use words like ain't or if they end if your parents end their sentences with prepositions, right?  And it's just you would realize  That it's just not important. You probably wouldn't even realize it. You would just never think about it  Why would there be a right or wrong way to speak?  So  In some ways these illiterate societies are have a more highly evolved  Concept of language than we do because we have our language so closely tied to literacy  Reading and writing or literacy are not studied by linguists  They're interesting from you know from historical and psychological points of view  But  Linguists don't study those because they are not  Language linguists study language and that is the natural language that develops in humans  We already talked about how?  Writing does not naturally occur in human societies  All right now in a very important thing that you have to know when studying linguistics is that  Spelling is important for literacy  It is not important for language you don't need to know how to spell to have a language  And spelling is not a naturally occurring phenomenon in language speakers  Linguists don't study orthography which is writing systems. So in English, we have an alphabet with one sound  Roughly speaking one sound one sound per letter in  Chinese they have logographs which is one symbol per word  in other languages they they have  they have  Syllable alphabets where there's one symbol per syllable that could be pronounced in that language  And  Linguists are not interested in this they're interesting right, but that's not what linguists study  Linguists study  Spoken language and sign languages because these two types of language are  Naturally occurring and they share a lot of properties in common  But writing symbols  written letters on a piece of paper  This is not an aspect of human language. So linguists do not study it  Now there's a few  Properties of language that I want to talk about before we go any further  We already talked about how language is rule bound. I probably should have included that on this slide  All human language is rule bound. Okay, so if you break one of the rules  That your English teacher taught you in English class  It doesn't mean that your language is breaking rules  What it means is that the rules of your language are actually different than what your English teacher taught you  But your language is still rule bound I ain't never done that before is a grammatical  Sentence in some dialects of English including my own  and it follows rules there are rules that that tell you how that sentence has to be formed right because  It  Would be an ungrammatical utterance to say I ain't that never done before  Because that violates a rule of word order and that dialect in my dialect of English  Sorry for going off on a tangent here, but all language is rule bound if you're a human who develops a language  Your language is bound by rules regardless of whether you've ever taken a class read a dictionary read a grammar book  This is a naturally occurring phenomenon in language  Also language is productive or creative meaning that you can say and understand  utterances that you've never heard before  For example my great-aunt Helga and her secretary Edith got sunburned while writing their hovercrafts through Boston  You've never heard this sentence before but you understand what it means  Okay, so you didn't have to learn the meaning of this sentence in order to understand it  I have never heard this sentence before but I was able to write it and speak it  Because I understand the way that the language works now, we did have to individually memorize each  Word in this sentence and the meaning of each of these words  And then compile the sentence using the rules of our grammar  So really the whole point of this is just to show you that you can understand sentences that you've never heard before  Language is arbitrary  There is no connection between the symbol and the meaning  Okay  The symbol being either the spoken word the hand signals or in the case of orthography  The written marks that you would make on the paper aka the letters or the logographs  These are all symbols. Okay  And by themselves they need they mean nothing  Okay, you need a language for that symbol to be in before it means something and what the language does is it assigns a  Meaning to the symbol. So for example the English word dog  the those  combinations of sound waves  Mean nothing by themselves and they have absolutely no relationship to the furry animal that we all love  Um that word could have just as easily been  Barrow or shine or hoon den or  Blah blah blah blah or anything else  But for whatever reason we didn't choose any of those words. We chose the word dog  There's not a reason we just chose it. It's arbitrary  Similarly we could have chosen the word fish to refer to the  Four-legged furry animal who is man's best friend, but we didn't we chose the word fish to represent a  Slimy scaly animal that swims in the rivers and you catch it  If you have a license  So so it's arbitrary I guess that's all I have to say about that  That there's no there's no natural logical connection between symbol itself and the meaning  And that's all I have for this video  Like I said, I'm really excited for this series because linguistics is fascinating to me  And I think it has a huge potential to help you with learning language  If you have any questions, please feel free to leave me a comment in the comment section below  Ask me a question on Twitter if you have any suggestions for videos that you would like to see related to linguistics  Please feel free to let me know and I'm really excited to move on to the next video in the series  So thanks for watching this one, and we'll see you guys next time
