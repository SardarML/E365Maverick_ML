[00:00:00 -> 00:00:06]  Do you ever feel at times that you lose touch with your passion, your ambition, and your drive to go after your art?
[00:00:06 -> 00:00:10]  Maybe you find you're lacking inspiration to show up and do the work that needs to be done.
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:18]  If that ever happens for you, then I want to share with you something that I found extremely useful to be able to blast through that roadblock.
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:23]  I recently published a video on powerful techniques that you can use when you're feeling overwhelmed.
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:30]  One of those techniques, which comes from Will Smith's autobiography, Will, is the concept of laying one brick.
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:40]  It involves taking a big, overwhelming-feeling project and narrowing the focus down into one single bite-sized achievable task, laying one brick.
[00:00:40 -> 00:00:46]  While that is an incredibly powerful technique, the inverse of that is also an incredibly powerful technique.
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:53]  And there's another book that I love. It's by Simon Sinek, and it's about the power of communicating your why.
[00:00:53 -> 00:00:56]  This was also a subject of his TED Talk.
[00:00:56 -> 00:01:03]  He, in the book, uses an example of two bricklayers that are building on a huge project.
[00:01:03 -> 00:01:08]  And one of the bricklayers is communicating what it is that he does.
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:14]  And he says, I am a bricklayer. I show up every day and I lay bricks. That's what I do.
[00:01:14 -> 00:01:22]  Then another bricklayer is used in the example. And when asked what he does, what he's up to, he says, I'm building a cathedral.
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:35]  So there's a mindset difference between those two people that could dramatically affect their sense of ambition and drive, fulfillment and passion.
[00:01:35 -> 00:01:41]  If the one person is just saying, what I'm doing is laying bricks, there isn't a lot of overarching meaning to that.
[00:01:41 -> 00:01:46]  There isn't an overarching, transcendent why that's driving that person.
[00:01:46 -> 00:01:57]  Whereas the second bricklayer, the one who's viewing him or herself as building a cathedral, that is a meaningful and powerful project.
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:04]  So if you find yourself feeling disconnected, even at moments, because we often weave in and out of these feelings.
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:11]  But if you're going through a dip and you find yourself disconnected from your sense of passion and drive, or you're feeling a sense of procrastination,
[00:02:11 -> 00:02:19]  or if you're having difficulty showing up and doing the work and doing what needs to be done, if you're stuck in some way, is another way to put it.
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:23]  If you're just stuck with your art, then this is a great one to give a whirl.
[00:02:23 -> 00:02:33]  If you instead zoom way out from the granular bite-sized stuff and say, what is the reason why I started doing this?
[00:02:33 -> 00:02:36]  Where am I going with this? What's my destination?
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:43]  Where in my wildest dreams and visions will I be when I become successful in this pursuit?
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:47]  And that's your why. That's what Simon Sinek is talking about in his book and in his TED talk.
[00:02:47 -> 00:02:52]  And if you connect with that and hold that in your mind when you're working,
[00:02:52 -> 00:03:01]  that can provide the sense of motivation that will get you to show up and continue beating on your craft and doing the day-in, day-out work
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:04]  that is necessary to achieve and realize your grander vision.
[00:03:04 -> 00:03:11]  That can be easier said than done, because this mindset shift, the ability to zoom out and take that broader perspective,
[00:03:11 -> 00:03:19]  the ability to hold your why really close to yourself and keep that in focus while you're pursuing your craft,
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:23]  takes the ability of your mind to focus and create that shift.
[00:03:23 -> 00:03:24]  It takes mind training.
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:32]  And I talked in my last video about some ways of engaging in mind training so that when it comes time to do this,
[00:03:32 -> 00:03:34]  that you have the capacity to be able to do that.
[00:03:34 -> 00:03:41]  What I recommended was that on a regular basis, you're integrating mind training in the same way that as musicians we do ear training.
[00:03:41 -> 00:03:45]  In the same way, to be fit and capable individuals, we do physical training for our bodies.
[00:03:45 -> 00:03:50]  We go to the gym or we do yoga or we run or we bike or we hike to be able to keep our physical body strong.
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:55]  And I implore you, as you begin down this journey of applying these techniques,
[00:03:55 -> 00:04:00]  to also have in your repertoire and to be regularly engaging in some form of mind training.
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:01]  Lots of ways to do that.
[00:04:01 -> 00:04:04]  There are concentration exercises.
[00:04:04 -> 00:04:07]  It could be mindful movement like yoga or tai chi.
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:08]  Could be breathing exercises.
[00:04:08 -> 00:04:10]  Maybe Wim Hof is a good place to start.
[00:04:10 -> 00:04:14]  And it could be more traditional forms of meditation.
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:17]  There's lots of ways to engage in mind training.
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:21]  And I would highly encourage you to begin to foray into that realm.
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:24]  Begin to build some capacity in that area.
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:29]  You will feel so much more capable and powerful when it comes time to apply these techniques.
[00:04:29 -> 00:04:31]  Thanks so much for connecting and watching this video.
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:33]  I'll catch you real soon. Much love.
