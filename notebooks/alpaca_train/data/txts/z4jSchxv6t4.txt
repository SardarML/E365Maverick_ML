[00:00:00 -> 00:00:03]  Few artists in history have had such a wide ranging impact on art and culture as the French
[00:00:03 -> 00:00:08]  painter Henri Matisse. His distinctly colourful style and often quite experimental works caught
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:13]  the attention of many collectors and critics and made him, alongside Picasso, one of the most well
[00:00:13 -> 00:00:18]  known and influential artists of the early 20th century. Matisse's work is quite interesting in
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:22]  many regards, but one that I wish to draw attention to today is his constant pushing
[00:00:22 -> 00:00:28]  against painting's tendency to represent its subjects realistically. Inspired by the Impressionist
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:32]  and Post-Impressionist painters who had sought new ways to paint reality before him, Matisse
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:36]  would devise his own painting methods that went even further in a search for what he termed
[00:00:37 -> 00:00:42]  an art of balance, purity and serenity. This search would lead Matisse to create bright and
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:47]  colourful works that over the course of his career would push the boundaries of representation
[00:00:47 -> 00:00:52]  further than ever before in a search for a deeper sense of beauty that he believed art could uncover
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:57]  in the world around us. Today we're going to discuss the artworks, processes and ideas of
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:01]  Matisse to try and understand what his art was all about. We'll discuss his development as an
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:06]  artist, the ideas and methods behind his work and the impact they had not just for modern art,
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:13]  but for our contemporary visual culture as well. Matisse, born in 1869, was the son of a grain
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:17]  merchant and he enjoyed a relatively middle class upbringing in his hometown of Le Cateau
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:22]  Cambricie in the north of France. He initially studied law, but found a new calling when his
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:26]  mother bought him some art supplies to pass the time while he recovered from a bout of appendicitis
[00:01:26 -> 00:01:30]  at the age of 20. Having no previous experience with art he was surprised to find great enjoyment
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:35]  in painting, and the following year he made the brave and perhaps foolhardy decision to
[00:01:35 -> 00:01:40]  refocus his education away from law and towards his new found interest. It wasn't quite that easy
[00:01:40 -> 00:01:45]  to just jump up and declare yourself an artist however, having no prior experience or training
[00:01:45 -> 00:01:50]  to speak of put him at a bit of a disadvantage though he was not deterred. His first step would
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:55]  be finding a teacher in the seemingly eternal capital of the art world, Paris. Paris at this
[00:01:55 -> 00:01:59]  time was a bit of a melting pot of artistic styles and movements. The inroads made by the
[00:01:59 -> 00:02:04]  impressionist and post-impressionist painters had finally relaxed the grip of the academies.
[00:02:05 -> 00:02:08]  In response a myriad of new styles were emerging side by side in the sea.
[00:02:09 -> 00:02:14]  This multiplicity would benefit Matisse greatly as he arrived in the Parisian art scene as something
[00:02:14 -> 00:02:20]  of a provincial, uneducated in the various ins and outs of the art world. His painting up to this
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:24]  point had been focused on mimicking reproductions of 17th century Dutch oil paintings, quite far
[00:02:24 -> 00:02:29]  from the works he would become known for. This initial interest in realism brought him to the
[00:02:29 -> 00:02:35]  studio of William Adolphe Bouguereau, who was pretty much the final form of academic painting
[00:02:35 -> 00:02:40]  made flesh. Bouguereau's teaching style stressed the traditional academic approach of drawing from
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:44]  casts and rigorous adherence to technical standards. As you can imagine he and Matisse
[00:02:44 -> 00:02:49]  did not get on too well and after a brief period of torturous study under the arch-academician
[00:02:49 -> 00:02:54]  Matisse left in search of a tutor who was a bit more his speed. After leaving the studio of
[00:02:54 -> 00:02:58]  Bouguereau, Matisse would go on to take evening classes under another established artist, the
[00:02:58 -> 00:03:02]  symbolist painter Gustave Moreau, whose unique teaching style focused on nurturing the voice
[00:03:02 -> 00:03:07]  of the individual student rather than beating them into submission with plaster cast studies.
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:11]  Moreau's teaching would be foundational for Matisse as it gave him the confidence to develop
[00:03:11 -> 00:03:15]  his interest in colour as well as his inclination to experiment with more modern approaches.
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:20]  Another figure who helped the young Matisse during this period was the ever helpful impressionist
[00:03:20 -> 00:03:25]  Camille Pissarro. Pissarro turned Matisse's attention to neo-impressionism, a style which
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:30]  relied on the science of colour theory. Neo-impressionist artists like George Seurat
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:36]  and Paul Signac used this rigorous style to create unique optical effects in the viewer's eyes
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:40]  through tiny dots of unmixed colour. Matisse would learn much from this method,
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:44]  even painting alongside Signac in this style for a time.
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:48]  Matisse benefited greatly from all of these teachers and peers, but there is one more
[00:03:48 -> 00:03:53]  figure we should mention who was pivotal to Matisse's development as he is to all modern art,
[00:03:53 -> 00:03:58]  the proto-modernist post-impressionist Paul Cézanne. As a young man, Matisse had purchased
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:03]  Cézanne's Three Bathers from the dealer Ambrose Vallard, a purchase he could ill afford but one
[00:04:03 -> 00:04:08]  that turned out to be wise. He held onto it for about 37 years, claiming that it sustained him
[00:04:08 -> 00:04:12]  during the most turbulent moments of his career. From this point onward, Matisse's
[00:04:13 -> 00:04:18]  From Cézanne, Matisse would learn many things, such as the way colour can lend paintings a kind
[00:04:18 -> 00:04:23]  of structure. Cézanne had constructed his works out of blocks of colours and tones placed adjacent
[00:04:23 -> 00:04:27]  to one another. He analysed his subjects and sought new ways of painting them that went beyond
[00:04:27 -> 00:04:32]  the conventional academic approach. This would inspire Matisse to devise his own ways of seeing
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:38]  his subjects, just as Cézanne had. Matisse did not, however, become a mere imitator of Cézanne,
[00:04:38 -> 00:04:42]  he would instead begin to develop a series of ideas that would advance what Cézanne had begun.
[00:04:43 -> 00:04:48]  This process would take him some time however, and in those interceding years he would suffer
[00:04:48 -> 00:04:53]  much hardship and doubt. In 1904 he held his first solo show at the gallery of Ambrose Vallard.
[00:04:53 -> 00:04:58]  After years of material hardship and hard work to get there, the response to this show was
[00:04:58 -> 00:05:02]  underwhelming. It made little impression and didn't really bring Matisse the recognition
[00:05:02 -> 00:05:08]  he had hoped for. That recognition however was not far off as just one year later he would find
[00:05:08 -> 00:05:13]  himself part of an unusual group of artists accepted to the Autumn Salon show. The works
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:17]  they exhibited there were bright and colourful and a synthesis of many of the ideas Matisse had
[00:05:17 -> 00:05:22]  picked up in Paris, though it wasn't exactly to everyone's taste, with one critic famously
[00:05:22 -> 00:05:29]  terming these works a pot of paint flung in the face of the public. The works which caused this
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:34]  dramatic reaction were a part of what we now term the Fauvist movement. Well, I say movement but
[00:05:34 -> 00:05:39]  that's a bit of a stretch. Fauvism was pretty informal as far as movements go. There was no
[00:05:39 -> 00:05:44]  café discussions a la Impressionism nor any of the grand manifesto writing that we'll see later
[00:05:44 -> 00:05:49]  with things like Dada and Futurism. The Fauvist movement in addition to barely being a movement
[00:05:49 -> 00:05:55]  was also quite short lived, existing really only for a couple of shows in 1905 and 1906 when many
[00:05:55 -> 00:06:00]  artists painting in a similar style were admitted to the Salon exhibitions. Most of those who
[00:06:00 -> 00:06:05]  participated were only really passing through on their way elsewhere, among them André Derain,
[00:06:05 -> 00:06:11]  who alongside Matisse was considered the leader of the style, and Maurice de Vlaminck, a pro cyclist
[00:06:11 -> 00:06:15]  turned painter who famously said he painted with his hair and his loins, though I'd say he'd been
[00:06:15 -> 00:06:20]  better off using a brush. Also among the Fauvist ranks was a young George Braque, pre-cubist and
[00:06:20 -> 00:06:25]  once again working in the shadow of a larger historic figure. Of all of them Matisse was
[00:06:25 -> 00:06:30]  perhaps the most committed to the style, as many of the qualities of Fauvism fit quite well with
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:36]  his own rapidly developing ideas about art. Those qualities of Fauvism emerged from the inspiration
[00:06:36 -> 00:06:40]  Matisse and his contemporaries found in the works of many modern painters who had come before them,
[00:06:40 -> 00:06:45]  including Cezanne, Van Gogh and the Neo-Impressionists. It was the fusion of these painters ideas
[00:06:45 -> 00:06:50]  regarding colour, visible brushwork and the nature of observation that would inspire them to create
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:55]  these often messy, brightly coloured works which seemed to explode off the canvas. Their unruly
[00:06:55 -> 00:07:01]  appearance led the critic Louis Vauxel to coin the term Fauve, French for wild beast, in reference
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:07]  to their creators. This might seem a little melodramatic to us today, especially in reference
[00:07:07 -> 00:07:11]  to Matisse who seems to have dressed like he was permanently on his way to a job interview,
[00:07:12 -> 00:07:16]  but to people of the time who were not used to such strong and unnatural colours these works
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:21]  must have seemed beastly indeed. A signature of the Fauvist style was the separation of colour
[00:07:21 -> 00:07:26]  from subject. Rather than colour being dictated by the subject's surface appearance, it was instead
[00:07:26 -> 00:07:31]  chosen according to what the artist felt would best suit their composition. This allowed Fauvist
[00:07:31 -> 00:07:34]  painters to pick and choose without restraint and freed the element of colour from the need
[00:07:34 -> 00:07:39]  to represent reality, allowing for it to be used in the most eye-catching manners possible.
[00:07:40 -> 00:07:44]  Another characteristic of the style and a knock-on effect of this loosening of colour
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:48]  was a flattening of the surface. Without carefully modulated tones of light and dark,
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:52]  Fauvist paintings continued the trend of rejecting the illusion of three-dimensional space
[00:07:52 -> 00:07:58]  and embracing the actuality of the canvas's flat surface. This would in turn allow the painter to
[00:07:58 -> 00:08:02]  place more emphasis on their composition, further unifying the elements of painting
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:07]  under this new approach. One more trait of Fauvism and one which is a little less wild
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:12]  than the rest of it is its subject matter, which remains rooted in traditional subjects.
[00:08:13 -> 00:08:17]  They may have been beasts, but they weren't mad. Fauvist paintings still depict common
[00:08:17 -> 00:08:22]  subjects such as people, landscapes, animals and nature. They may no longer be quite as real
[00:08:22 -> 00:08:26]  looking, but it is important to note they are still rooted in observing nature, even if it is
[00:08:26 -> 00:08:31]  in a more loose and expressive fashion. The result of this shifting of concerns was the creation of
[00:08:31 -> 00:08:36]  room for the artist to express themselves. Expression of the artist's feelings regarding
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:41]  their subject, expression through the interaction of colour, shape, space and line. This was the
[00:08:41 -> 00:08:46]  reason Matisse and his mates had abandoned realism and apparent good taste. They sacrificed the
[00:08:46 -> 00:08:50]  surface appearance of reality in order to find a way to express a deeper and surpassing sense of
[00:08:50 -> 00:08:57]  beauty, which was to be found in colour, brushwork and composition. As far as examples of the movement
[00:08:57 -> 00:09:02]  go, Matisse's portrait Woman with a Hat is fairly emblematic, so let's take a look at that to see
[00:09:02 -> 00:09:09]  some of those beastly traits in action. The painting's subject, Matisse's then wife Amélie,
[00:09:09 -> 00:09:13]  was not so much the cause for concern. As with most Fauvist works, it is a fairly standard
[00:09:13 -> 00:09:18]  subject for a painting, in this case a portrait of a well-to-do woman in her finery, not a million
[00:09:18 -> 00:09:23]  miles away from Renoir's portraits of the new wealthy urban classes from a few decades before.
[00:09:24 -> 00:09:28]  The controversial part is of course not the subject, but the way she was painted.
[00:09:29 -> 00:09:33]  The work's surface is composed of a patchwork of bright colours brushed onto the canvas with
[00:09:33 -> 00:09:38]  apparent speed and excitement. Worse than that, in between the cacophony of colours there are
[00:09:38 -> 00:09:44]  bare patches of empty canvas which Matisse seemingly hasn't painted at all. As a painter
[00:09:44 -> 00:09:49]  you have one job, covering things in paint, and yet here's this Matisse fella, just flat out
[00:09:49 -> 00:09:54]  refusing to do so. Despite the outrage such sketchy painting would provoke, Matisse did
[00:09:54 -> 00:09:58]  have good reasons for doing this, which are of course in line with the Fauvist style.
[00:09:59 -> 00:10:04]  He has used a free assortment of colours across the surface that, while obviously unnatural,
[00:10:04 -> 00:10:08]  are balanced against one another. The greens play against the reds and the light purple on
[00:10:08 -> 00:10:12]  the right hand side plays against a small patch of yellow on the other side of Amélie's face.
[00:10:13 -> 00:10:16]  This play of complementary colours lends structure to the work.
[00:10:18 -> 00:10:22]  There is also the selection of tones he has used. The darker blacks and blues of Amélie's hat and
[00:10:22 -> 00:10:27]  dress pop against the light background and make sense of those light patches of unpainted canvas.
[00:10:29 -> 00:10:33]  The strong contrast they create adds dynamism to the work, which further builds that explosive
[00:10:33 -> 00:10:38]  quality of the Fauvist style in tandem with the excitable brushwork. Amélie herself might be
[00:10:38 -> 00:10:44]  painted roughly, but not unrecognisably so. Her hat, dress and fan are all social indicators of
[00:10:44 -> 00:10:49]  her status as a bourgeois woman, which creates tension between that knowledge and the wild
[00:10:49 -> 00:10:54]  painting style. The patchwork of colours Matisse has used to sculpt the planes of her face may
[00:10:54 -> 00:10:58]  not be realistic, but they are indicative of the form and even a sense of light.
[00:10:59 -> 00:11:03]  Blue and green shadows and orange highlights give us some sense of directional light in the
[00:11:03 -> 00:11:08]  otherwise colourful void of this composition, which further gives us the sense that this is
[00:11:08 -> 00:11:14]  observed rather than a totally fictional composition. Finally, the blocking and placement
[00:11:14 -> 00:11:19]  of the figure along with the curves created by her arm and the fan lend further structure to
[00:11:19 -> 00:11:26]  this otherwise chaotic canvas. It may seem sketchy and rough at first glance, but at a closer
[00:11:26 -> 00:11:32]  inspection it reveals the careful hand of Matisse at work. He may want to appear as a wild beast,
[00:11:32 -> 00:11:37]  but behind it all is a careful analytic disposition that is enjoying the process
[00:11:37 -> 00:11:42]  of painting and perhaps the pageantry of the Fauvist style. This portrait garnered a lot
[00:11:42 -> 00:11:47]  of controversy, even in comparison to other Fauvist works, which ended up working out well
[00:11:47 -> 00:11:52]  for Matisse, who despite his misgivings received an unexpected boon when the work was bought by
[00:11:52 -> 00:11:57]  American novelist and art collector Gertrude Steen. Gertrude and her brother Leo were avid
[00:11:57 -> 00:12:02]  collectors of modern art and their patronage would be decisive in the careers of many prominent
[00:12:02 -> 00:12:08]  artists of the time. Despite Leo referring to a woman with a hat as the ugliest smear of paint
[00:12:08 -> 00:12:13]  he had ever seen, their art collector instincts ended up paying off, and the purchase marked the
[00:12:13 -> 00:12:18]  beginning of a long relationship with Matisse that propelled the artist to the next stage of his
[00:12:18 -> 00:12:23]  career. Before we go on let's take a moment to comment on a new trend that the Steens were
[00:12:23 -> 00:12:28]  getting in on, the advent of the art collector. We have already seen the kind of major impact art
[00:12:28 -> 00:12:34]  dealers like Ambrose Vallard and Paul Durand-Ruel had on the development of art and this trend was
[00:12:34 -> 00:12:39]  to further mutate as the 20th century went on. The Steens were among a new wave of private art
[00:12:39 -> 00:12:44]  collectors who were characterised by two factors, being culturally literate and rich as Crocius.
[00:12:44 -> 00:12:48]  As a result the Steens would have a huge impact on the development of modern art by funding many
[00:12:48 -> 00:12:54]  of the figures we know today, among them Matisse and Picasso. This trend of the rich, a class not
[00:12:54 -> 00:12:57]  traditionally known for their good taste or restraint, getting involved in the arts is
[00:12:57 -> 00:13:02]  interesting. Over time it would come to replace the old systems of state and church patronage
[00:13:02 -> 00:13:06]  that had funded the arts before and eventually give birth to the nightmarish hellscape that we
[00:13:06 -> 00:13:11]  now call the art market. It was also thanks to the Steens that Matisse would be introduced to
[00:13:11 -> 00:13:16]  many other contemporary artists and collectors, including Pablo Picasso. These two men were to
[00:13:16 -> 00:13:21]  become the dominant figures of art in the first half of the 20th century. Despite Matisse's
[00:13:21 -> 00:13:25]  apparent initial dislike for the blow-hard Spaniard, the talent that each saw in the other
[00:13:25 -> 00:13:30]  would fuel something that approximated a lifelong friendship and artistic rivalry.
[00:13:31 -> 00:13:35]  In those next few years Matisse would rise to prominence. Now financially secure and growing
[00:13:35 -> 00:13:40]  more confident, he would produce many of his most well-known works, which were increasingly bold in
[00:13:40 -> 00:13:45]  their experimentation with colour, space and line. With this increased fame came increased scrutiny.
[00:13:46 -> 00:13:50]  Matisse felt the need to confront his critics and explain some of his ideas in a statement
[00:13:50 -> 00:13:56]  he published in 1908 entitled Notes of a Painter, which we are going to take a look at before we
[00:13:56 -> 00:14:01]  get into some of the more mature Matisse works, as it's a pretty useful text to help us understand
[00:14:01 -> 00:14:05]  how he consolidated all those influences from his early days and how they were incorporated
[00:14:05 -> 00:14:08]  into his ever-developing ideas of a new modern art.
[00:14:10 -> 00:14:14]  Matisse begins his statement by saying that he is interested in what he describes as
[00:14:14 -> 00:14:19]  expression. He says that expression does not lie, as we might think initially,
[00:14:19 -> 00:14:24]  solely in the human face or in some dramatic motion, but rather is present in every aspect
[00:14:24 -> 00:14:29]  of an image, from its figures to the space around them to their proportions, all of this contains
[00:14:29 -> 00:14:35]  an expressive quality as well. Figuring out how and what to express leads to the creation of a
[00:14:35 -> 00:14:40]  composition, which Matisse defines as the decorative arrangement of the elements at
[00:14:40 -> 00:14:46]  the painter's command to express his feelings on his subject. As such every part of the picture
[00:14:46 -> 00:14:51]  has its role to play, and from this it follows that any superfluous elements in a work should
[00:14:51 -> 00:14:56]  be removed, as they add nothing helpful and may even distract the viewer from more vital parts
[00:14:56 -> 00:15:02]  of the composition. Matisse also describes his working methods and how they have developed.
[00:15:02 -> 00:15:06]  He says that when he starts working on a picture, the first thing he does is record
[00:15:06 -> 00:15:12]  his superficial sensations of the subject, a first impression if you will. He notes that when he
[00:15:12 -> 00:15:17]  started this would sometimes have been enough to satisfy him, but as he has come to see more,
[00:15:17 -> 00:15:22]  as he puts it, this first impression is no longer sufficient to convey what he sees and
[00:15:22 -> 00:15:28]  feels about his subjects. He says that at first he could not stand to look back at old works which
[00:15:28 -> 00:15:33]  seemed to him to be created in embarrassing states of overexcitement, and notes that this
[00:15:33 -> 00:15:38]  was a mistake. What he has come to do instead is to look more closely at his works and his
[00:15:38 -> 00:15:45]  subjects in search of what he terms a condensation of sensations. Which is an interesting way to put
[00:15:45 -> 00:15:51]  it. What he means by this is that rather than being satisfied with that first superficial
[00:15:51 -> 00:15:57]  impression, he instead pushes past it, reworking his painting again and again until those first
[00:15:57 -> 00:16:03]  excited sensations are condensed into what he describes as a more serene and broader composition.
[00:16:04 -> 00:16:07]  To illustrate what he means by this he gives the example of drawing a female figure.
[00:16:08 -> 00:16:14]  His first instincts will be to imbue the drawing with grace and charm as he puts it. This first
[00:16:14 -> 00:16:20]  impression however is not enough, he then seeks to condense his sensations of the figure by seeking
[00:16:20 -> 00:16:26]  out the essential lines that define it. He notes that this reworking process may diminish the charm
[00:16:26 -> 00:16:31]  of that first approach, but this is only because the charm is no longer the only concern, it still
[00:16:31 -> 00:16:36]  exists but it is now situated within a broader sense of the subject, one that he has condensed
[00:16:36 -> 00:16:42]  from that first sensation. Matisse's example of a female figure also demonstrates that his favourite
[00:16:42 -> 00:16:48]  subject is people as the human form allows him to express what he describes as his almost religious
[00:16:48 -> 00:16:54]  awe towards life. The human form for Matisse contains endless depths to explore for expressive
[00:16:54 -> 00:16:59]  qualities. Matisse says that he can uncover deeper and essential qualities that go beyond
[00:16:59 -> 00:17:03]  the likeness of a face or the structure of anatomy to find a deeper sense of beauty.
[00:17:05 -> 00:17:09]  Matisse's refusal to settle on the first impression contrasts significantly with the
[00:17:09 -> 00:17:13]  entire movement based around doing pretty much just that, impressionism.
[00:17:15 -> 00:17:19]  Rather than focusing on the moment to moment existence of things like impressionism does,
[00:17:19 -> 00:17:24]  Matisse claims that the artist should look for an underlying reality, a truth that exists
[00:17:24 -> 00:17:28]  behind all of those fleeting impressions which the artist can seize upon.
[00:17:30 -> 00:17:34]  He gives us the example of motion to illustrate the difference between his work and the
[00:17:34 -> 00:17:40]  impressionist approach. When we see a frozen snapshot of a figure in motion that particular
[00:17:40 -> 00:17:44]  contortion of muscles and tension is meaningless to us without the understanding of where the
[00:17:44 -> 00:17:51]  motion came from and where it is going. With that knowledge however, the moment shown condenses
[00:17:51 -> 00:17:54]  and thus contains an expression of the entire motion.
[00:17:55 -> 00:18:00]  So it is with his work which seeks to condense the aspects of his subject into an image which
[00:18:00 -> 00:18:05]  expresses an underlying truth, in contrast to impressionism's obsession with the single
[00:18:05 -> 00:18:10]  disconnected moment. Having described his concepts Matisse then gets into some of the mechanics of
[00:18:10 -> 00:18:16]  painting and creating compositions. He says for example that if he puts a black dot on a white
[00:18:16 -> 00:18:22]  sheet that dot is clearly visible from anywhere. If he then puts a second and a third dot the first
[00:18:22 -> 00:18:28]  mark loses clarity and becomes a bit lost. In order for that first dot to maintain its clarity
[00:18:28 -> 00:18:33]  it must be altered in some way, made larger or more noticeable or else it risks becoming lost.
[00:18:33 -> 00:18:38]  He then expands this concept into the realm of colour where he says that as he sets down
[00:18:38 -> 00:18:43]  strokes of different hues each new one will diminish the importance of the previous one.
[00:18:43 -> 00:18:47]  A red by itself is quite strong, but place a green and a yellow next to it and that initial
[00:18:47 -> 00:18:52]  red quickly loses its power. To avoid this weakening it becomes necessary for Matisse
[00:18:52 -> 00:18:57]  to rework his images, balancing the tones and colours carefully so they do not weaken
[00:18:57 -> 00:19:03]  but instead reinforce one another. This is where the condensation that he described before happens.
[00:19:03 -> 00:19:09]  It emerges from this process of reworking and balancing. Matisse likens the outcome to a
[00:19:09 -> 00:19:13]  musical composition in the way that it must produce a harmonious balancing of the elements,
[00:19:13 -> 00:19:19]  just as a piece of music must harmoniously balance its own tones. Matisse also states that when it
[00:19:19 -> 00:19:24]  comes to colour its chief goal should be, as with everything else in the painting, in service of
[00:19:24 -> 00:19:30]  expression rather than mimicking reality. As such he chooses his colours by the sensations they evoke
[00:19:30 -> 00:19:34]  in him rather than their representative qualities. He doesn't rely on colour theory too much either,
[00:19:35 -> 00:19:39]  having once been a follower of colour theory dependent styles like neo-impressionism
[00:19:39 -> 00:19:44]  he now finds the various rules and dictums of colour theory too limiting. Instead he only
[00:19:44 -> 00:19:48]  considers a work complete when all of the parts have found their balance in relation to all of
[00:19:48 -> 00:19:52]  the others, not when it complies to any standards of arbitrary colour theories.
[00:19:52 -> 00:19:57]  Having covered all of this we arrive at the big one, the Matisse quote that all accounts of the
[00:19:57 -> 00:20:02]  man are required by international law to mention, the whole art of balance, purity and serenity
[00:20:03 -> 00:20:05]  I hope that what we have covered so far will make this a little bit clearer but
[00:20:05 -> 00:20:08]  just to be safe let's go over it just a bit more.
[00:20:09 -> 00:20:14]  Matisse wants to create an art of balance, purity and serenity, which as we have seen means
[00:20:14 -> 00:20:19]  establishing harmonious relationships between his painterly elements and forgoing initial
[00:20:19 -> 00:20:25]  appearances in pursuit of a deeper expression of his subjects. The process of reworking and
[00:20:25 -> 00:20:30]  harmonising is where he finds balance. The purity he speaks of come from his refinement of his
[00:20:30 -> 00:20:35]  observations, pairing back his first impression into a composition that expresses his feelings
[00:20:35 -> 00:20:41]  and ideas in as clear a manner as possible, while also removing any excesses that might confuse us
[00:20:41 -> 00:20:47]  along the way. The serenity part refers to his preference for relaxing subject matter,
[00:20:47 -> 00:20:54]  no edgy Goya style monstrosities for Matisse. They must be soothing as Matisse's goal is to
[00:20:54 -> 00:20:59]  provide a kind of art which will be relaxing for, as he puts it, the mental worker, for the
[00:20:59 -> 00:21:05]  businessman as well as the man of letters. For these people Matisse hopes his artwork will become
[00:21:05 -> 00:21:10]  something akin to a good armchair, a comfy and relaxing spot that lets the mentally fatigued
[00:21:10 -> 00:21:16]  man of learning unwind. Matisse is conceiving of his art as a mental one, which has appeal first
[00:21:16 -> 00:21:21]  and foremost to educated men with refined tastes, though the quote betrays a bit more than he
[00:21:21 -> 00:21:26]  probably intended it to. The crafty git has singled out two kinds of people, the businessman and the
[00:21:26 -> 00:21:30]  man of letters as his audience, a wise move as these people typically have a lot of time and
[00:21:30 -> 00:21:35]  money to waste on ponderous things like artworks. Considering also that his social circle at the
[00:21:35 -> 00:21:40]  time thanks to the Steens was composed of folks like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway,
[00:21:41 -> 00:21:44]  it's not surprising that he would think of his art as being for their benefit.
[00:21:44 -> 00:21:49]  What his art is meant to mean to the man of no letters or little business he is less forthcoming
[00:21:49 -> 00:21:54]  about. Matisse now established as a big deal in the art world would, like Picasso, go through many
[00:21:54 -> 00:22:00]  periods in the rest of his life, but his overall goal of achieving an art of balance, purity and
[00:22:00 -> 00:22:06]  serenity would remain the same. With these ideas in mind let's take a look at an example of his
[00:22:06 -> 00:22:10]  work from around the same time as this statement was written. We've mentioned his proclivity for
[00:22:10 -> 00:22:15]  expressive figures and many of the works from this time show this off. The one I want to draw
[00:22:15 -> 00:22:20]  your attention to is a diptych, a set of two paintings which he was commissioned to paint
[00:22:20 -> 00:22:26]  by the Russian businessman and art collector Sergei Suchkin. These two works known simply as
[00:22:26 -> 00:22:30]  Dance and Music demonstrate many of the traits of Matisse's painting he outlined in his notes
[00:22:30 -> 00:22:35]  and furthermore become some of the most well-known examples of modern art in history.
[00:22:35 -> 00:22:40]  Suchkin was an interesting chap. The son of a self-made millionaire industrialist he collected
[00:22:40 -> 00:22:43]  art much like the Steens with a focus on the new modern styles which appealed to him,
[00:22:43 -> 00:22:50]  and he owned works by Cezanne, Monet, Gauguin and Van Gogh. It was under commission from Suchkin
[00:22:50 -> 00:22:54]  that Matisse undertook work on these two paintings which would become an important milestone in his
[00:22:54 -> 00:23:00]  career. The idea for Dance came from a previous and also well-loved Matisse work, The Joy of Life,
[00:23:00 -> 00:23:05]  which depicts various figures in the process of, well, enjoying life. Nestled in amongst the
[00:23:05 -> 00:23:09]  painting's beautiful Gauguin-reminiscent colours is a circle of dancers that Matisse would return
[00:23:09 -> 00:23:14]  to as a subject for this new work. He first created a mock-up of sorts, working out his
[00:23:14 -> 00:23:19]  composition and methods with the goal of conveying his subject in a manner that he intended to seem
[00:23:19 -> 00:23:25]  effortless to the viewer. This aspect is pretty important as it explains questions that many will
[00:23:25 -> 00:23:33]  no doubt have, which is, why does it look so… basic? Imagine for a moment if you will, that
[00:23:33 -> 00:23:40]  this work was as well-rendered as a work by say, Bouguereau or David. While it would no doubt look
[00:23:40 -> 00:23:44]  a lot more realistic, it's doubtful that it would feel as fluid as Matisse intended.
[00:23:46 -> 00:23:50]  The key to this feeling for Matisse was making it look like the painting itself was effortless
[00:23:50 -> 00:23:54]  and natural, as if it had spontaneously formed on the canvas appearing out of nowhere,
[00:23:54 -> 00:24:00]  as feelings of joy or the rhythm of dance often do themselves. To achieve this sense of natural
[00:24:00 -> 00:24:05]  ease he created this first version, now referred to as Dance 1, in full scale using oil paints,
[00:24:05 -> 00:24:10]  which was unusual for a preparatory work, but also allowed him to plan and control
[00:24:10 -> 00:24:15]  every aspect of the final version. The difference between it and the version Suchkin got is
[00:24:15 -> 00:24:20]  illustrative of Matisse's process of looking and reworking and the kind of results it could produce.
[00:24:22 -> 00:24:27]  The second version of Dance keeps the aspects of simplicity and rhythm, but there's been some
[00:24:27 -> 00:24:32]  changes to the colours and the figures that drastically alter the tone. Unlike the soft
[00:24:32 -> 00:24:37]  amorphous forms of the dancers before, these figures have harsher angles, traces of outlines
[00:24:37 -> 00:24:44]  that denote a strength of form not present in Dance 1. Then there is the colour, the rusted
[00:24:44 -> 00:24:49]  red that the figures are soaked in creates a very different feeling to the soft pink flesh tones of
[00:24:49 -> 00:24:56]  before. These figures seem somehow more primitive and tribal, we can almost hear the chanting and
[00:24:56 -> 00:25:00]  drumbeats of ritual that the movements imply. The refinement of the concept has uncovered
[00:25:00 -> 00:25:04]  something different in the concept of dance, something ancient and ritualistic,
[00:25:05 -> 00:25:12]  as if we are seeing the genesis of the act itself. Matisse's ultra-simple painting style
[00:25:12 -> 00:25:17]  has exposed this expressive quality in a way that more realistic methods would struggle to depict.
[00:25:19 -> 00:25:24]  Just as with the Fauvist works, Dance also makes use of ultra-saturated tones that pretty much
[00:25:24 -> 00:25:28]  tell colour theory to take a hike. Rather than toning down areas or making safer choices,
[00:25:28 -> 00:25:33]  Matisse instead balances the painting's harmony on a knife's edge with three competing tones of
[00:25:33 -> 00:25:38]  overpowering colour that he has somehow wrangled into a harmony that evokes a primal creative
[00:25:38 -> 00:25:44]  instinct without rendering the viewer blind. This is that sense of balance at work again.
[00:25:44 -> 00:25:50]  The space of the work as well is deliberately confused. Firstly, the background is comprised
[00:25:50 -> 00:25:55]  of two planes of blue and green with no other distinguishing features. This serves a few
[00:25:55 -> 00:26:00]  purposes. It evokes the idea of virginity through its untouched quality, thus making the act of
[00:26:00 -> 00:26:07]  dancing seem more like a kind of origin point. The bare basic approach also speaks of the purity
[00:26:07 -> 00:26:11]  Matisse sought in his works, only showing what is needed and omitting all else.
[00:26:13 -> 00:26:18]  It also has a bit of fun confusing the space. The green seems to be a hilltop or field of some kind,
[00:26:18 -> 00:26:23]  but the blue could be either sky above or water below. Matisse has deliberately done this to
[00:26:23 -> 00:26:28]  question the illusion of 3D space, as was the style at the time. The painting is not however
[00:26:28 -> 00:26:33]  totally flat. The lack of competing detail draws our attention to the one area where there is a
[00:26:33 -> 00:26:38]  sense of depth and movement, the dance itself. The rhythmic distribution of the figures seems
[00:26:38 -> 00:26:43]  to swirl across the canvas, coming towards us and then receding away. At the point which seems
[00:26:43 -> 00:26:47]  closest to us Matisse has also carefully placed the one break in the circle of dancers,
[00:26:47 -> 00:26:51]  conveniently layered over the dancer behinds legs so as to not disrupt the colour,
[00:26:51 -> 00:26:55]  this gap can be read as a sort of invitation from Matisse to the viewer, to join in the dance
[00:26:55 -> 00:27:01]  themselves. Porel music shares many of the same traits, but its comparatively dour figures don't
[00:27:01 -> 00:27:06]  quite evoke the same excitement. Not even the one who is literally playing the worlds smallest
[00:27:06 -> 00:27:12]  violin. Despite perhaps being overshadowed by its more extroverted sibling, the pair of paintings
[00:27:12 -> 00:27:16]  work together to depict the theme Matisse had in mind of the primitive act of artistic creation.
[00:27:17 -> 00:27:21]  The simple, limited painting and refined compositions Matisse has used to depict
[00:27:21 -> 00:27:25]  this subject are quite successful in this service. I don't know about you but when I
[00:27:25 -> 00:27:30]  look at these works there is something definitely ancient and powerful about them, as if Matisse
[00:27:30 -> 00:27:34]  had found some simple archaic harmony that reaches back through the millennia to express
[00:27:34 -> 00:27:41]  a fundamental moment of creation. Suchgen was needless to say pretty chuffed with them,
[00:27:41 -> 00:27:44]  although he did have to wait some 5 years while Matisse repeatedly repainted the
[00:27:44 -> 00:27:49]  blue parts until he was happy. Suchgen later complained that while they did look great during
[00:27:49 -> 00:27:53]  the day, at night under his new electric lights the colour harmony was exceedingly different.
[00:27:56 -> 00:28:00]  Electric lights were not the only unexpected development of the time. Suchgen would in a
[00:28:00 -> 00:28:04]  few short years after Dance and Music's commission find himself exiled and his collection seized by
[00:28:04 -> 00:28:09]  the revolution that swept Russia, which no doubt put the whole lighting situation into perspective.
[00:28:10 -> 00:28:14]  Matisse back in France would soon be confronted by a similarly historic event in the First World War.
[00:28:16 -> 00:28:20]  Matisse was by this time too old to fight, though he appears to have faced great anxiety because of
[00:28:20 -> 00:28:24]  the war. The front lines were not far from his childhood home and his elderly mother was in
[00:28:24 -> 00:28:28]  German controlled territory where he could not reach her. This anxiety is reflected in many of
[00:28:28 -> 00:28:34]  his works from the period leading up to and during the war, where that trademark Matisse colour seems
[00:28:34 -> 00:28:39]  to drain from them and greys and blacks become more pronounced. The Piano Lesson is one of
[00:28:39 -> 00:28:44]  these works, showing Matisse's son hard at work at his thankless task of piano practice,
[00:28:44 -> 00:28:46]  to which his father condemned him for two hours every morning.
[00:28:48 -> 00:28:51]  The most striking thing about this work is its austere dominating grey.
[00:28:52 -> 00:28:57]  The areas of colour that are present seem to recede in power and become more abstract than
[00:28:57 -> 00:29:01]  ever before, barely even registering as objects at all, but rather as geometric intrusions.
[00:29:02 -> 00:29:06]  The boy sitting behind the piano is the most figurative thing we see, and even he
[00:29:06 -> 00:29:12]  seems trapped behind the austere blocks of black and red. The wedge of black across his
[00:29:12 -> 00:29:17]  eye is similarly disconcerting. In discussing many of these more dour works, Matisse talks
[00:29:17 -> 00:29:22]  about re-appropriating black as the colour of light, rather than the colour of darkness,
[00:29:22 -> 00:29:28]  and in doing so tries to deny any depressing or non-serene connotations that may be present, but
[00:29:28 -> 00:29:34]  I'll let you be the judge of that. Bathers by the River, which Matisse worked and reworked
[00:29:34 -> 00:29:39]  over the duration of the war, also bears the marks of a deeply felt stress. Its surface is
[00:29:39 -> 00:29:44]  much more divided, its drawing much more severe and its geometry more angular than the curvy,
[00:29:44 -> 00:29:51]  indulgent Matisse we have come to expect. While it lacks the spatial aspects of Cubism,
[00:29:51 -> 00:29:56]  it's worth noting that this work doesn't look too far away from Picasso's signature style,
[00:29:56 -> 00:30:03]  which Matisse supposedly rejected. If not on the surface, it does seem that subconsciously the
[00:30:03 -> 00:30:08]  stress of the war was indeed getting to him. Despite any stresses that may have fueled them,
[00:30:08 -> 00:30:13]  these ever more abstract works were received well and further established Matisse's reputation as
[00:30:13 -> 00:30:18]  a master of modern art. Which is exactly why the period of time following the war he spent in Nice
[00:30:18 -> 00:30:25]  from about 1917 to 1930 confounded so many of his critics and admirers. Matisse had left Paris for
[00:30:25 -> 00:30:30]  a holiday in Nice and ended up enjoying it so much he stayed, for about a decade, enjoying the light
[00:30:30 -> 00:30:35]  and scenery of the southern French coast. The war years had been hard and the upper class bourgeois
[00:30:35 -> 00:30:40]  lifestyle Matisse was accustomed to in Paris was more or less coming to an end as a result.
[00:30:40 -> 00:30:46]  He may have left Paris in reaction to this, and the move definitely marks another turn in his work.
[00:30:47 -> 00:30:51]  Unfortunately for many of his most ardent admirers, these new works produced in Nice would
[00:30:51 -> 00:30:58]  also look like a bit of a cop out. The problem with Matisse's work in Nice, if there even is one,
[00:30:58 -> 00:31:03]  is that it looks a whole lot like a retreat from the modernism he had previously championed.
[00:31:04 -> 00:31:08]  Gone are the minimal details and flat planes of colour of his previous work,
[00:31:08 -> 00:31:13]  they are replaced by scenes with pattern, more naturalistic spaces and, my god, a sense of light.
[00:31:16 -> 00:31:20]  Most of these works were painted from his hotel room and focus on interiors and the
[00:31:20 -> 00:31:25]  Mediterranean coast as well as a slew of women he painted in a fashion reminiscent of odalisque
[00:31:25 -> 00:31:29]  painting. Matisse did say his favourite subject was the human form and during this period he
[00:31:29 -> 00:31:34]  certainly indulges himself. These paintings were no doubt influenced by the light of the southern
[00:31:34 -> 00:31:39]  coast but they also bear traces of Islamic art that he had seen during his trips to Algeria
[00:31:39 -> 00:31:43]  and Morocco, as well as the historical connotations of odalisque painting itself,
[00:31:44 -> 00:31:49]  half imagined dreams of harems and extra-European promiscuity that painters from Delacroix to
[00:31:49 -> 00:31:54]  Picasso loved so much. This perceived retreat from modernism coupled with the more indulgent
[00:31:54 -> 00:31:58]  aspects of his work in this period have led to a bit of conflict regarding whether or not any of
[00:31:58 -> 00:32:04]  it is any good, or was Matisse just resting on his laurels rather than striving endlessly for
[00:32:04 -> 00:32:09]  new modernist plateaus? Some have argued that his work can be dismissed as tawdry,
[00:32:09 -> 00:32:13]  self-indulgent nonsense, others have claimed it to be a brilliant synthesis of his earlier
[00:32:13 -> 00:32:19]  advances and the impressionist love of light. Robert Hughes with an interesting take as usual,
[00:32:19 -> 00:32:24]  characterises it as Matisse seeking an artistic connection to an area that had long played host
[00:32:24 -> 00:32:29]  to other great artists like Cezanne and Courbet, with Matisse seeking to do for the southern coast
[00:32:29 -> 00:32:34]  what they had done for its countryside. This period could even be considered to be part of
[00:32:34 -> 00:32:40]  the so-called return to order, a trend of more avant-garde artists returning to a more traditional
[00:32:40 -> 00:32:44]  manner of production in a perhaps psychological response to the horrors of the first world war,
[00:32:45 -> 00:32:48]  something that affected many painters of the time, including Picasso.
[00:32:48 -> 00:32:52]  Whatever may be said about these works and their perceived problems or lack thereof,
[00:32:53 -> 00:32:57]  they are in themselves often quite beautiful and show many of the traits we have come to
[00:32:57 -> 00:33:02]  see across Matisse's career. His love of line and colour is now enriched with detailed pattern
[00:33:02 -> 00:33:06]  and his expressive figures contain more of a sense of flowing weight than ever before.
[00:33:07 -> 00:33:11]  That sense of serenity that he sought is also present, something that was perhaps missing from
[00:33:11 -> 00:33:16]  those wartime works of the previous years. Matisse would work more or less uninterrupted
[00:33:16 -> 00:33:21]  in Nice for many years and his reputation would continue to grow. During this time he painted,
[00:33:21 -> 00:33:26]  made sculptures and continued to draw, amassing an enormous body of work. At the outbreak of the
[00:33:26 -> 00:33:31]  second world war however, Matisse's comfortable life in Nice was brought to an end by Allied
[00:33:31 -> 00:33:37]  bombing raids which forced him to evacuate to a villa near Vence. World war 2 was harder on
[00:33:37 -> 00:33:41]  Matisse psychologically than the first one had been. His daughter Marguerite, a communist and
[00:33:41 -> 00:33:46]  a member of the French resistance was captured by the Gestapo. She was tortured though managed
[00:33:46 -> 00:33:51]  to escape thanks to a stroke of luck. Matisse was distraught at this but he soon had other problems.
[00:33:52 -> 00:33:58]  He was diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo a risky operation to survive. While he did recover
[00:33:58 -> 00:34:02]  complications from surgery would leave him bedridden for the rest of his life.
[00:34:03 -> 00:34:07]  This physical difficulty prompted in him a change of working habits that would bring about the final
[00:34:07 -> 00:34:13]  chapter of his artistic career and perhaps his best work. Despite or perhaps because of his
[00:34:13 -> 00:34:18]  new limitations he would discover new ways of working that would at long last unify his love
[00:34:18 -> 00:34:28]  of colour and line. The process that led him to the synthesis had begun unsuspectingly in the 30s,
[00:34:28 -> 00:34:32]  some years before his illness. Once again working under the commission of a ludicrously wealthy
[00:34:32 -> 00:34:37]  patron, which must have been very mundane for him at this stage, Matisse was asked to design a large
[00:34:37 -> 00:34:43]  mural and in a very 20th century sort of twist it was to be a sequel. A sequel in this case to
[00:34:43 -> 00:34:49]  Suchkin's famous commission The Dance. Dance 2, Dance Harder if you will. The ludicrously wealthy
[00:34:49 -> 00:34:54]  individual this time was one Dr. Albert Barnes, an eccentric collector of all things modern who
[00:34:54 -> 00:34:58]  had amassed a huge collection featuring works by everyone from Cezanne to Van Gogh to Monet to
[00:34:58 -> 00:35:04]  Renoir. It was an amazing collection which Barnes hung almost on top of each other in his own home
[00:35:04 -> 00:35:08]  with all the restraint of a drunken interior designer. To top it all off Barnes wished to
[00:35:08 -> 00:35:14]  commission a huge mural from the great Matisse himself. It was during the planning process for
[00:35:14 -> 00:35:19]  this mural when Matisse made a small measurement error, seemingly unnoticeable in the plans,
[00:35:19 -> 00:35:23]  when transferred to the large arched surface prepared for it, the discrepancy translated
[00:35:23 -> 00:35:28]  into a major error that required Matisse to quite literally go back to the drawing board.
[00:35:29 -> 00:35:34]  This miscalculation would lead him to discover a simpler method for composing pictures than
[00:35:34 -> 00:35:40]  drawing and scaling them up. If he were to instead use cut out sheets of paper at the same
[00:35:40 -> 00:35:44]  scale as his intended final piece, he could move them at will to create and refine the shapes of
[00:35:44 -> 00:35:51]  his composition. With this method the mural was quickly completed. This cut out method would be
[00:35:51 -> 00:35:55]  revelatory for Matisse, and later when he was confined to his bed he would revisit it as a
[00:35:55 -> 00:35:59]  way to continue working when he could no longer paint or draw in the manner he was accustomed to.
[00:36:00 -> 00:36:04]  The process was of course not really anything new. Collage as we call it today is the simple
[00:36:04 -> 00:36:08]  act of cutting and sticking paper to create an image. Beloved by children and hated by
[00:36:08 -> 00:36:13]  adults who have to clean up afterwards, collage had come into popularity in Paris in the early
[00:36:13 -> 00:36:19]  20th century. The proliferation of cheap printed materials for posters, advertising and newspapers
[00:36:19 -> 00:36:24]  created an abundance of material for financially challenged artists of the day. Picasso and Braque
[00:36:25 -> 00:36:31]  had both experimented with it as had Marcel Duchamp. Now it was Matisse's turn to try his
[00:36:31 -> 00:36:37]  hand at it. Aided by his assistants who would paint sheets of paper with gouache paint, Matisse
[00:36:37 -> 00:36:41]  would cut shapes with a large scissors from the sheets and lay them on top of each other to create
[00:36:41 -> 00:36:47]  compositions. This process would almost replace drawing for him, as he saw it as a new way of
[00:36:47 -> 00:36:52]  doing exactly the same thing. Rather than drawing the shape and filling it with colour, he was now
[00:36:52 -> 00:36:59]  drawing by cutting straight into colour itself. In this way he arrived at a working method that
[00:36:59 -> 00:37:04]  synthesised his love of drawing and painting into one unified approach. These works show a joy and
[00:37:04 -> 00:37:09]  inquisitiveness that most people have beat out of them at an early age. The fact that Matisse
[00:37:09 -> 00:37:12]  created them as a bedridden man at the end of his life should tell us something of the joy he took
[00:37:12 -> 00:37:17]  from his work and the endless inquisitiveness that he possessed. These works are among his most
[00:37:17 -> 00:37:22]  beloved and it's not hard to see why. They display many of the same concerns for expression,
[00:37:22 -> 00:37:27]  balance and harmony that he had pursued throughout his career. One colour carefully placed next to
[00:37:27 -> 00:37:32]  another, one shape balanced with a counterpoint. The process of cutting and arranging these shapes
[00:37:32 -> 00:37:37]  allowed Matisse to focus all of his attent on finding those simple formal balances that he
[00:37:37 -> 00:37:45]  always enjoyed. One well known example of these cut out works is The Snail, completed in 1953,
[00:37:45 -> 00:37:51]  just a year before Matisse's death. Surprisingly huge if you've ever seen it in real life.
[00:37:51 -> 00:37:56]  This work is about 3m tall and was completed by Matisse cutting sheets and his assistants
[00:37:56 -> 00:38:01]  lightly pinning them in place under his directions. So exacting were his instructions that when the
[00:38:01 -> 00:38:06]  work was sent to be mounted by the framers an accurate tracing was made so as to not move
[00:38:06 -> 00:38:12]  any of the parts even a millimetre from where Matisse had intended. A further demonstration
[00:38:12 -> 00:38:18]  of his belief in the utmost importance of composition. Now I know what you're thinking,
[00:38:18 -> 00:38:23]  a snail? Really? That doesn't look like any snail I've ever seen without the aid of
[00:38:23 -> 00:38:31]  hallucinogenic substances. It looks very abstract you might say. Well while there were plenty of
[00:38:31 -> 00:38:35]  actual abstract painters running around by the time this was made Matisse was not one of them,
[00:38:36 -> 00:38:42]  and even this gargantuan work was not exactly abstract. Instead it came from observations
[00:38:42 -> 00:38:47]  of nature as Matisse's work always had. The inspiration for The Snail came from a series
[00:38:47 -> 00:38:52]  of drawings Matisse made of actual snails which he held in one hand and drew with the other.
[00:38:52 -> 00:38:57]  From these studies he became aware of the geometry present in the swirl of the snail's shell.
[00:38:58 -> 00:39:01]  This naturally occurring spiral became his inspiration and the result
[00:39:02 -> 00:39:07]  is what we see in the cutout. Matisse translated the swirling shapes of the shell
[00:39:07 -> 00:39:12]  into a swirl of colours, playing one complementary off another and building a compositional spiral
[00:39:12 -> 00:39:17]  that once again demonstrates his need for balance in his work as well as his love of nature.
[00:39:17 -> 00:39:22]  The cutouts represent the last stage of Matisse's career and in many ways an accumulation of the
[00:39:22 -> 00:39:26]  ideas he had dealt with along the way, allowing him to create formally balanced works that really
[00:39:26 -> 00:39:33]  do evoke a kind of serenity in how simple and effortless they appear. Matisse's goal of an art
[00:39:33 -> 00:39:37]  of balance, purity and serenity seems to be realised in these later works and in the cutouts
[00:39:37 -> 00:39:42]  in particular. But as we have seen many of these ideas were present in his works all along, it just
[00:39:42 -> 00:39:46]  took nearly a lifetime of practice to really get there. The result was a kind of art that
[00:39:46 -> 00:39:52]  privileged the joy of colour and simple graceful line over polished surfaces and realistic depictions
[00:39:52 -> 00:39:56]  and in doing so made more room for the artist to express themselves and more room for a variety
[00:39:56 -> 00:40:01]  of different approaches to painting the world around us. In doing so Matisse opened the way
[00:40:01 -> 00:40:05]  for artists who came after him to push further away from any kind of traditional representation
[00:40:05 -> 00:40:10]  and fully embrace the possibilities presented by colour, shape and line alone to uncover that
[00:40:10 -> 00:40:16]  deeper sense of beauty he had saw all along. Matisse's work is of great importance to not
[00:40:16 -> 00:40:21]  only modern art but also to our wider visual culture as well. The language of simplified
[00:40:21 -> 00:40:25]  shapes and colours that he pioneered has been widely adopted from corporate logos to the
[00:40:25 -> 00:40:30]  language of graphic design and illustration which comprises so much of the media and advertising we
[00:40:30 -> 00:40:35]  are bombarded with daily. Consider if you will the design of any advert or logo from the start
[00:40:35 -> 00:40:40]  of the 20th century in comparison to their modern equivalents. The influence of Matisse is palpable
[00:40:40 -> 00:40:45]  as pretty much across the board we see less detail and more communicable shapes and colours become the
[00:40:45 -> 00:40:50]  norm. While there are many reasons for the change in design sensibilities over the last century or
[00:40:50 -> 00:40:54]  so, it's hard to imagine much of our modern visual landscape without Matisse's initial
[00:40:54 -> 00:40:58]  experiments proving the visual efficacy of simplified colour and shape in communicating
[00:40:58 -> 00:41:05]  complex ideas. Matisse's simple and colourful style lends itself well to the hyperfast world
[00:41:05 -> 00:41:09]  of modern visual culture where a million images at any one time are competing for our attention.
[00:41:09 -> 00:41:13]  What Matisse himself would have thought about this god only knows. While the traces of his
[00:41:13 -> 00:41:17]  fingerprints are all over our visual culture it certainly doesn't seem to be very balanced,
[00:41:17 -> 00:41:22]  pure or serene most of the time, and yet this is a great example of the kind of impact art can have
[00:41:22 -> 00:41:28]  on the day to day world around us. Before we go too far into the complexities of modern visual
[00:41:28 -> 00:41:32]  culture, there are many more outcomes from the work of Matisse that were contemporary to his
[00:41:32 -> 00:41:37]  own day and which we should also explore. The one I have in mind being that expressive quality he
[00:41:37 -> 00:41:41]  kept banging on about, which many other artists at the time had also noticed and which would soon
[00:41:41 -> 00:41:46]  lead to another set of artists and movements that we will be discussing in further detail next time.
[00:41:46 -> 00:41:51]  So I hope you'll join me then and thanks for watching.
