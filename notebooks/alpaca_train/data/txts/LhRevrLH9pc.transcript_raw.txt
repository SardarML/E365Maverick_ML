 Hello everybody. There's a good chance that if you watch this channel you like  history and you also like maps and geography and some of my favorite books  are historical atlases and I wanted to share some of those favorite sources  with you. I have had some people ask you know what sources do I like to read.  For Civil War history there's the National Geographic Atlas of the Civil  War a comprehensive guide to the tactics and terrain of battle by Neil  Kagan and Stephen Hislop. This shows the grand theater of things so for instance  for the Gettysburg theater it'll show the armies you know what towns they were  in as they go from Fredericksburg Virginia up towards Pennsylvania and  then it sort of zooms in to specific parts of the battlefield. But these are  very helpful visual guides and you can tell that these atlases are they're  they're large they're oversized and that's so there's more map space but  this is a very very good resource. I'm going to share with you is Past Worlds this is  the Atlas of Archaeology it's by Colin Renfrew who's really sort of the  world-famous archaeologist he's written a number of college textbooks on the  subject so there's a good chance if you take archaeology in college you will run  into his work. But Past Worlds is a wonderful book it's actually I think  it's out of print now if HarperCollins is watching put this book back in print  it's really great it's it's wonderfully illustrated. For the sake of copyright I  won't open the book I don't want to violate any copyright rules. Each page is  just chock full of information so for instance you'll open the book and the  two full page spread will be a map of Europe and it will show you know this is  where copper came from and this is the trade routes and it has all those very  helpful arrows and there's also tons of text on the page you could really spend  an afternoon just on a couple pages and just learn a ton of information because  the information is concisely presented yet it's very highly informational. The  Atlas of Archaeology also has artifacts and site layouts how different  sites were so for instance ancient Ur in southern Iraq for instance you know it  lays out how these sites were. Closer to home in the United States I have the DK  Smithsonian American Revolution visual history so in addition to maps and  artifacts it's also going to have all the paintings and a lot of the documents  and you have that in one bound volume and that's just what's so handy about  these books and again I wish I could just open it and show you I just don't  want to violate copyright rules but these really are treasures these atlases.  Another book that I like is the Atlas of World Archaeology it's edited by Paul  Bond and it's very similar to past worlds in that you open the book and  there'll be a two page full spread of a map and both past worlds and Atlas of  World Archaeology essentially go chronologically so at the beginning of  the book starts in prehistory and then it moves chronologically through world  history but very very helpful. I just picked up this one Ancient Egypt this is  by the publisher DK I really like DK's works because they're very visual and so  if you're if you like to see things then DK is a very good publisher they  specialize in this kind of thing I wish I could open up this book and show you  how graphical and pictorial it is but this would have the sites of ancient  Egypt in addition to showing you where on a map things are and shows you the  temples has these wonderful high-resolution images from within the  chambers of the ancient Egyptian structures. I have two biblical atlases and biblical  atlases are actually probably the easiest to get because they must have  the the most interest you know the widest audience and so this is the  Oxford Bible Atlas and then this is the Collins Atlas of the Bible and these  Bible atlases are actually very helpful for those that are interested in the  ancient Near East so Mesopotamia the Levant you know which is Palestine  ancient Israel and and then Egypt for those that are interested in Egypt to  Syria there's a lot going on you know those early Bronze Age civilizations and  then through the Iron Age you know and like the other archaeological books like  the Atlas of World Archaeology the Oxford Bible Atlas they go basically  chronologically you know starting with the early Bronze Age and then  working through. Finally I have the National Geographic Space Atlas mapping  the universe and beyond this is of course mostly a science atlas so it's  going to have the solar system and the different planets and the different  celestial objects however there is a human history in here because it does  show the objects that human beings have put out into space so for instance on  the moon it will show where on the moon the different Apollo missions were where  on Mars the different rovers were sent so there is the human history aspect to  it so that's why I included it as a historical atlas even though you can  probably tell it's more of like a science atlas but these are all of these  atlases are just wonderfully illustrated they're great resources again for like a  quiet Saturday afternoon you can open them to almost any page you don't have  to read them from start to end you can open them to any page you have full  two-page spread shows a very well drawn map it's very clear with the color  shades and the arrows that show the trade routes and or the movement of  armies or the migrations of people or a culture identified through pottery  that's moving from one place to another so very very helpful keep reading if you  read 10 pages a day you'll read 300 pages in a month thank you for watching  thank you for your support I love the comments
