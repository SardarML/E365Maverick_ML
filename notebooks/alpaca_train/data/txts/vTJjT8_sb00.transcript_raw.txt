 how you guys I'm back I'm now going to go through how to calculate distance I  took another map that has it's a bit bigger and I'm sure we we will be able  to do it now okay just to be clear I'm gonna just because it's going into the  next question I'm going to calculate the distance of the dark line that you see  there at the bottom okay I'm using a plain ruler a small one they usually  don't ask you something that's more than 15 centimeters but you can either use a  15 centimeters or a 30 centimeter ruler I prefer that it is usually clear but I  don't have a clear one and in home now so I'm just using the one that I that I  do have on hand so if we want to calculate the distance from of that line  there usually it will be from one line to another or from one number to another  if they ask you perhaps from M to E or something like that they usually will be  an arrow when you measure from an arrow you usually do it from the point there  the point of the arrow not anywhere else it's from the point of an arrow to  another place if it's like a trigonometry beacon it will be in the  middle of that but I'll do that when we do the gradient so if we calculate the  distance the first thing that we need to do is we need to measure from the one  side to the other side in this case if you measure it you will see it is seven  comma three centimeters so you will just start and say okay seven comma three  centimeters but now you need to figure out by what do I multiply this now I  usually told my kids and you guys are my kids now you draw yourself this table it  consists of three columns and three rows this row is when you take it to meter  and this row is when you take it to kilometer this will be a topographical  which is 1 to 50,000 and this will be your ortho which will be 1 to 10,000  okay so if they say you can start with the exam the first thing that you do on  the front page is you just draw yourself this block it's going to save you a  major a lot of time with meters you know it will be multiplied by 500 and  kilometers will be multiplied by 0 comma 5 on the ortho photo meters will be  multiplied by 100 and your kilometers will be multiplied by 0 comma 1 okay so  if you have this then you will know what to do well as we are working on the  topographical map the colored one we are going to go to meters in this case and I  want to calculate what is the distance of that line in actual life in meters  okay so we did measure it it's 7 comma 3 centimeters you just say multiply by 500  and you will get the answer take your calculator most of you have this one I  do prefer it so I'm going to use it when I do the the videos you're going to say  7.3 multiplied by 500 you're going to get the answer of three six five zero  three six five zero meters okay if it was two kilometers you would have said  seven comma three centimeters multiplied by zero comma five and you would have  gotten three comma six five kilometers all right so please just make sure what  does the question ask this question ask in meters or in kilometers highlighted  marker just make sure that you know to what do you work and please remember the  unit at the end if the unit is not there you're not going to get the mark okay so  if you know how to calculate the distance then calculating the area will  be very easy please remember yes the formula for this is area equals length  times breadth that's the easy part but you need to know what the length and  what the breadth are so you need to first calculate what is the length of  the area that you're going to do and what is the breadth okay we already did  calculate the breadth from that side to that side so we do have the breadth and  I'm just going to write it again that's when you did and you said seven comma  three centimeters and this one is four meters I'm going to do it in meters yes  I'm going to say seven comma three multiplied by 500 and that gives you  three six five zero meters with the length again you take your ruler and you  measure you will see it is six comma I think it's six in this case so you will  say six comma six centimeters multiplied by 500 and that will give you three  thousand three hundred meters this if you've watched Afrikaans one and the  English one you will see that there might be a measuring difference in the  two just how I saw it at that stage remember in the test I will give you a  leniency and I will give you more clarity on what you should do in the  test just to make sure you get your marks okay now we get back to the the  formula you write it again you say area equals length times breadth now you take  the answer and you substitute so you say three thousand three hundred meters  multiplied by three thousand six hundred and fifty meters and you will get the  answer of one two zero four five one two three do not have a heart attack when  you see it's a big number just write it down that is your answer you just write  it down if you did work with if the question was in kilometers please note  my unit just note the unit if you worked in kilometers your length would have  been six comma six multiplied by zero comma five that would have been three  comma three kilometers and the breadth would have been seven comma three  centimeters multiplied by zero comma five and that would have been three  comma six five kilometers when you do the substitution you will say area  equals length times the breadth which is three comma three kilometers multiplied  by three comma six five kilometers and that will give you the answer of one two  comma zero four five kilometers you would have seen if you did this on the  calculator your first answer would have been in a fraction you can't write the  fraction as an answer you use that button the S turn to D SD with the  moment that you push it it will put it into a decimal and then you can just  write the decimal answer now please remember that it is squared at the end
