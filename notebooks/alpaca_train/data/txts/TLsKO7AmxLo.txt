[00:00:00 -> 00:00:28]  â™ª Yeah that clock keeps ticking till we start up in here. Yeah that clock keeps ticking till we start up in here. If you came to learn chemistry, you did your part. Time is ticking down so just be ready cause it's about to start. When we solving for problems, we solving information. You know Ben's Chem videos will provide you with equations. Never have to stop and think about it, this the station. That will provide you with the chemistry all in relation. If you came to learn chemistry, you did your part.
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:46]  Hello everyone and welcome to the Ben's Chem videos Sunday night live stream. Tonight I am very very excited to be starting a new project which I am calling the organic chemist stream which as the name implies is a live stream in which we talk about organic chemistry.
[00:00:46 -> 00:01:01]  So I've been covering general chemistry off and on for over a decade now and I've been asked by people over and over and over again when are you going to start covering organic chemistry and I keep you know putting it off putting it off because there's still so much general chemistry content to cover.
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:17]  But recently I've decided that I think it's probably a good time to start covering organic chemistry so I'm really really excited about this and I hope that you are as excited as I am and I'm not sure if you if you've been paying attention to my channel at all.
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:44]  But recently I put out a poll on the community tab of my channel page so I'll show you that poll now. So basically it was just two choices one keep covering general chemistry or to start covering organic chemistry right and as of the time that I checked the poll 98 people voted and many thanks to all 98 of you who voted and the results are shown below.
[00:01:44 -> 00:02:05]  Okay so you got you know 43% voted in favor of continuing to cover general chemistry and the remaining 57% voted in favor of starting organic chemistry and so with 57% of the vote the voters who voted to start covering organic chemistry have successfully won me over.
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:16]  So that's kind of why I'm choosing to do this because I want to do what you guys want to do I want to respond to your feedback so again since the majority of people voted for organic that's what we're going to do.
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:36]  I got a message from Adiola Aziz says good morning from Nigeria it's 2am here. Wow. Good morning. Good morning. It's actually nine o'clock p.m. over here, eastern side of the United States so thanks for watching and that goes for all of you who are watching right now and all of you who will later be watching this as a video.
[00:02:36 -> 00:03:01]  By the way for those of you who are watching now I do have a discord server that you can call into the show there's a link down in the description if you would like to call into the show if you do call in do me a favor and let me know in the chat that you're calling in because I don't I only have like two monitors and I don't really have enough space to have my discord window open at all times it just do me a favor and I don't have any moderators or anybody helping me out this is kind of a one man show.
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:30]  So if you do decide to call it just let me know in the chat that you're calling in and we can have a voice to voice conversation I would love the opportunity to do that as always historically not a lot of people have taken picking me up on that but nonetheless that option is available and if you're watching this as a video please leave a comment because as I'll talk about later on in this stream your feedback is super super important to me and I want your feedback to determine the direction of where we take where we take the stream.
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:51]  What topics we cover and how we cover them and how much practice we do and all that kind of stuff all right so so tonight basically what I want to do is just a very very gentle kind of get your toes wet in the water sort of introduction I don't want to lay on too thick with the content tonight there's basically two things I want to do.
[00:03:51 -> 00:04:20]  First thing I want to do is to simply define organic chemistry right very very important that we're all on the same page with regard to the definition of organic chemistry because if we're not all on the same page then that might lead to some problems later on so we're going to define organic chemistry and we are also going to talk about some of the general chemistry topics that we really really need to have under our belt we need to have a rock solid understanding of several not all but several general chemistry topics so we're going to talk about
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:50]  those and then I think next week we'll sort of go into those and more thorough detail but tonight again it's going to be pretty casual just a conversation a gentle introduction to organic chemistry so yeah usually when it comes to introducing a new topic I always like to just the first thing I like to do is just define the topic and so definition of organic chemistry I forget where I pulled this from I think it was from the American Chemical Society I should have listed the source here on the slide but I didn't so this is
[00:04:50 -> 00:05:19]  the definition of organic chemistry it's the study of the structure properties composition reactions and preparation of carbon containing compounds so carbon right carbon is sort of at the root of organic chemistry and you might be asking yourself well there's you know over a hundred other elements in the periodic table what is so special about carbon to the point where we have big textbooks and semester long courses devoted to the study of compounds
[00:05:19 -> 00:05:48]  that contain this one element and the answer is that carbon is really really really versatile right you can do a lot with it carbon likes to form bonds with other carbon atoms it likes to form bonds with non-carbon atoms like hydrogen and nitrogen and oxygen and fluorine chlorine bromine iodine all this kind of stuff there are several molecules in which you have very very long chains of carbon atoms joined together and then off of those chains you can have branches of carbon atoms with other stuff hanging off of it
[00:05:48 -> 00:06:17]  with other stuff hanging off of them carbons can double back on themselves to form rings of carbon atoms four-membered rings five-membered rings six-membered rings 18 member rate just there's so many possibilities so the fact that carbon is so versatile is what gives rise to a huge like literally millions and millions of possible compounds containing carbon each with their own unique properties reactivity methods of synthesizing them I mean the list just goes on and on and on
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:46]  and on and on so this is why organic and also organic chemistry applies a lot to our daily lives right the food that we eat the clothes that we wear us the macromolecules that make up living organisms proteins RNA DNA those kind of things right so organic chemistry very very big very very important discipline right so the next thing I want to show you guys is the textbook that I'm using
[00:06:46 -> 00:07:15]  now I don't think it's super critical for you to necessarily know the book that I'm using I mean organic chemistry is organic chemistry I don't think you're gonna find anything in an organic chemistry book that's gonna like contradict another organic chemistry book it's pretty much all the same and also as I do these streams I don't think I'm gonna go you know from front cover to back cover in any kind of like order of my textbook I'm just kind of cook I'm gonna kind of cover the textbook
[00:07:15 -> 00:07:44]  I'm gonna kind of cover the topics as I see fit and what sort of what's logical what's sensible but nonetheless you might be interested in the book that I'm using this is gonna be the book that I use that I sort of like read off of and gather my thoughts and prepare for the live streams throughout the week it's called organic chemistry the author is David Klein this is the fourth edition of the book offspring freak says yes great book choice thank you yeah you know this actually isn't the book that I use when I was studying way back in college
[00:07:44 -> 00:08:13]  I used a book authored by a guy named John McMurray and I really liked that book so it kind of took a lot for me to abandon the McMurray textbook and go for the Klein textbook but I've heard so much about this book this seems to be like the most popular organic chemistry textbook and so it makes sense for me to kind of you know work off of this book as I prepare for these presentations so if you would like to sort of follow along with the same book that I'm using this would be the book that you want to find a way to get your hands on and I'm gonna be doing that as well
[00:08:13 -> 00:08:42]  find a way to get your hands on but again like I said it's totally not necessary organic chemistry is organic chemistry I just wanted to let you know in the interest of full transparency that this is the book that I'm going to be using offspring freak says I used McMurray in college as well yeah it was pretty good right I thought it was pretty good and then later I think maybe like two years or so after I took organic chemistry they switched from McMurray to Klein and it I noticed it because the Klein book was
[00:08:42 -> 00:09:12]  significantly more expensive than the McMurray book but anyway enough about the book so let's move on there's another slide coming up here that is a pretty important to me it's kind of you know clowning around a little bit just posting memes on this slide but I really really wanted to emphasize the importance of feedback you know I really want the organic chemistry stream to be feedback driven to be community driven you know I want to talk about what you guys want to talk about you know whatever topics you want to discuss in the
[00:09:12 -> 00:09:42]  stream related to organic chemistry that's what I want to talk about right not just the topic selection but also you know how much practice you want to do just literally everything that we can do in this stream I want it to be tailored to what you the audience wants and so to that end I say please lay the feedback on me I the more of it I can get the better if the stream sucks let me know that the stream sucks I mean that's
[00:09:42 -> 00:10:12]  good valuable information to have I mean if you think it sucks I would also like to know why you think it sucks or if you think it's good let me know I mean I want to know everything I want to know what you're thinking it is absolutely essential for the growth and improvement of this stream and of this channel so thank you Amelia Rasmussen says McMurray is a religion for me at this point to be honest I don't know what you mean by that you mean like you religiously refer to the McMurray textbook and you just say no to all the other
[00:10:12 -> 00:10:42]  textbooks and maybe I need to reconsider the choice of the book and then go back to McMurray I don't know but okay enough enough about books and we're back on books now let's get off of that topic so alright so we've defined organic chemistry we you know we know the definition of it I have told you what book I'm using and I have put a lot of emphasis on the fact that I really really want and need your feedback to do a good job at what I'm doing because I don't want to be wasting any of your time I certainly don't want to be wasting any of
[00:10:42 -> 00:11:12]  my time so I want to have a good stream I need plenty of good feedback from you so let's talk about some of the general chemistry stuff that we need to have under our belt in order to sort of lay the foundation for a really good understanding of organic chemistry so when it comes to organic chemistry there are two main general chemistry topics that are going to be very very valuable going forward with organic chemistry and these are two
[00:11:12 -> 00:11:41]  very broad topics one of them is atomic structure and the other one is chemical bonding so very very broad topics there's a lot of information within those two topics so let's talk about it let's beginning with atomic structure so these are just a couple of bullet points that I just kind of wrote up here and there's probably other stuff that would be useful to know that's not included in this bulleted list but I think this is like a good place to start
[00:11:42 -> 00:12:11]  right so by now and again I'm teaching organic chemistry under the assumption that you already have a decent understanding of general chemistry but nonetheless I think it's important to sort of revisit some of this stuff because sometimes when you study things you get really deep in the wood in the weeds and you tend to forget about the basic underlying scientific principles that govern the behavior that you're looking at so okay so atomic structure right by now we know that
[00:12:11 -> 00:12:40]  an atom is composed of a nucleus and an electron cloud right most of the mass the overwhelming majority of the atoms mass and all of its positive charge is concentrated in a little teeny tiny by volume position in the center in the center of the atom called the nucleus and the rest of the atoms volume is taken up by the negatively charged electron cloud and I'm calling it an electron cloud
[00:12:40 -> 00:13:00]  because the best most accurate way to describe the behavior of an electron is to describe a region of space in which you are likely to find the electron and we call those regions of space orbitals which sort of transitions us into the next bullet point here the quantum mechanical model of the atom so this is the
[00:13:01 -> 00:13:29]  most contemporary most current most commonly accepted model of the atom that we use today and I actually have an entire playlist there's going to be a lot of links in the description by the way I probably should have mentioned this earlier on in the stream but once I get around to saving this as a video I'm going to put a bunch of links in the description that show you my playlists and my videos that go into more thorough detail about all these topics that we're going to talk about tonight all this general chemistry stuff
[00:13:30 -> 00:13:53]  right so the quantum mechanical model of the atom it's basically a manifestation of the electron behaving not only as a particle in the sense that it has like a definite mass and definite charge and stuff like that but also that that electrons behave as waves right and in behaving like waves well waves have some interesting properties where they build each other up that's called constructive interference and then in other
[00:13:54 -> 00:14:22]  in other situations waves destructively interfere meaning that they cancel one another out right and the result as a result of the wave behavior of electrons, you get these discrete energy levels right that's the big discovery when it comes to the quantum mechanical model of the atom is that the energies of electrons are quantized they are limited to certain discrete values right so when electron gets promoted from one energy level to another
[00:14:22 -> 00:14:29]  it doesn't climb up from one energy it literally teleports it just instantly jumps from one energy
[00:14:29 -> 00:14:33]  level to another that was kind of the the big discovery when when the quantum mechanical model
[00:14:33 -> 00:14:39]  was first being proposed right and so as a result of all that you have these things called principal
[00:14:39 -> 00:14:45]  energy levels and then within principal energy levels you have what are called sub levels and
[00:14:45 -> 00:14:52]  sub levels are generally shown by letters like the s sub level with the s orbitals the p sub level with
[00:14:52 -> 00:14:58]  the p orbitals the d sub level the f sub level and so on and then within sub levels you have orbitals
[00:14:58 -> 00:15:04]  right you have principal energy levels each principal energy level has a given amount of
[00:15:04 -> 00:15:10]  sub levels each sub level has a given amount of orbitals and again i have videos uh just check
[00:15:10 -> 00:15:15]  the links in the description if you're watching this as a video uh explaining all of this in very
[00:15:15 -> 00:15:23]  very thorough detail right and so when we're describing what the electrons in an atom uh
[00:15:23 -> 00:15:28]  are doing and sort of where they are and how they're positioned within the atom we use something
[00:15:28 -> 00:15:35]  called an electron configuration right so the electron configuration specifies which principal
[00:15:35 -> 00:15:41]  energy levels which sub levels which orbitals are populated by electrons and the lowest energy
[00:15:41 -> 00:15:47]  electron configuration of an atom that's what we call its ground state electron configuration
[00:15:47 -> 00:15:55]  right and so i have a video uh explaining uh how to build the ground state electron configuration
[00:15:55 -> 00:16:01]  of any element in the periodic table uh like i said i'll be sure to provide the link for that
[00:16:01 -> 00:16:08]  video in the description and then one important aspect of electron configurations is the concept
[00:16:08 -> 00:16:15]  of valence electron right so valence electrons those are the electrons that are located in the
[00:16:15 -> 00:16:20]  outermost principal energy level the outermost shell right shell is just kind of a synonym for
[00:16:20 -> 00:16:25]  principal energy level right so those valence electrons those outermost electrons those are
[00:16:25 -> 00:16:30]  the most important electrons that an atom has because it is the valence electrons that
[00:16:30 -> 00:16:37]  participate in chemical bonding right chemical bonding is pretty important right and so uh
[00:16:37 -> 00:16:43]  electron configurations valence electrons um one thing that's also important to point out
[00:16:43 -> 00:16:49]  is the stability of the noble gas electron configuration so remember what the noble
[00:16:49 -> 00:16:54]  gases are those are all the elements in the rightmost group of the periodic table
[00:16:55 -> 00:17:01]  your helium your neon your argon and so on and so forth what the noble gases have in common
[00:17:01 -> 00:17:07]  is that their valence shell their outermost principal energy level is completely full of
[00:17:07 -> 00:17:13]  electrons and there is a special stability a special uh low potential energy situation
[00:17:13 -> 00:17:20]  uh that is achieved when you have a full valence shell and so other elements in the periodic table
[00:17:20 -> 00:17:26]  right you can think of them as like jealous of the noble gases right they will uh in the case of a
[00:17:26 -> 00:17:32]  metal lose electrons or in the case of a non-metal uh gain electrons or share electrons with other
[00:17:32 -> 00:17:38]  atoms in order to achieve that noble gas electron configurations right and this is where things like
[00:17:38 -> 00:17:43]  the octet rule come into play right they call it an octet rule because the s and p sub levels
[00:17:43 -> 00:17:50]  together account for eight electrons in the p block over here in the periodic table right
[00:17:51 -> 00:17:58]  so but we'll get into we'll get into that in more thorough detail uh also later um another
[00:17:58 -> 00:18:05]  very very important property of electrons or of elements uh as another manifestation
[00:18:05 -> 00:18:10]  of the quantum mechanical model is a property called electronegativity electronegativity
[00:18:10 -> 00:18:16]  very very important property yep i do have a video entirely devoted to electronegativity
[00:18:16 -> 00:18:23]  um and electronegativity remember is the tendency of an atom to draw electrons uh toward itself
[00:18:23 -> 00:18:29]  right and for reasons that i thoroughly discussed in my electronegativity video
[00:18:29 -> 00:18:36]  electronegativity tends to increase as you go up a group of the periodic table and as you go
[00:18:36 -> 00:18:43]  uh from uh from left to right so the the highest uh right most elements like fluorine and oxygen
[00:18:43 -> 00:18:49]  those are the most electronegative elements and then you know your metals on the bottom left hand
[00:18:49 -> 00:18:54]  corner of the periodic table like francium and things like that those are the least electronegative
[00:18:54 -> 00:19:01]  they have a very lousy tendency to attract electrons uh to themselves okay so again that's
[00:19:01 -> 00:19:09]  kind of the the main uh thing that we need to know or these are the main things that we need to
[00:19:09 -> 00:19:15]  sort of understand about atomic structure so i want to ask you guys who are watching live right
[00:19:15 -> 00:19:22]  now um any of these bullet points any of these topics uh in your opinion should we go over these
[00:19:22 -> 00:19:29]  things in greater detail because all of them are uh quite important right very very important
[00:19:29 -> 00:19:33]  especially to understand electron configurations very very important to understand valence
[00:19:33 -> 00:19:38]  electrons noble gas configuration and extremely important that we understand electronegativity so
[00:19:38 -> 00:19:43]  if anything uh if you're fuzzy on any of these topics and you think we should go into more detail
[00:19:43 -> 00:19:49]  um especially let's say after you watch my my videos that i have on these topics uh let me
[00:19:49 -> 00:19:55]  know leave a comment i i really want to know so all right so that's atomic structure um and then
[00:19:55 -> 00:20:01]  the other broad general chemistry topic that we need to make sure we understand very very well in
[00:20:01 -> 00:20:09]  order to take a crack at organic chemistry is chemical bonding let me uh move myself out of
[00:20:09 -> 00:20:20]  the way here so make myself whoops let me change that okay all right so chemical bonding so there's
[00:20:20 -> 00:20:26]  a lot of information in here um and again i have videos on all this stuff uh so it's kind of
[00:20:26 -> 00:20:32]  important to understand just the basics right so what is a chemical bond why do chemical bonds form
[00:20:32 -> 00:20:37]  right so chemical bonds you can think of them as like the glue that sort of hold atoms together
[00:20:37 -> 00:20:43]  right and the reason why uh chemical bonds for so a chemical bond is basically just a strong
[00:20:43 -> 00:20:49]  attractive force uh between atoms and the reason why chemical bonds form right it all has to do
[00:20:49 -> 00:20:57]  fundamentally it all has to do with the tendencies of like charges to repel one another and opposite
[00:20:57 -> 00:21:02]  charges to attract one another right so we understand that atoms are composed of subatomic
[00:21:02 -> 00:21:08]  particles the nucleus has the positively charged protons in it and then the rest of the atom has
[00:21:08 -> 00:21:12]  the negatively charged electrons right and so there's all these different attractions and
[00:21:12 -> 00:21:19]  and repulsions right you have the nuclei repelling of two atoms the nuclei of two atoms repelling one
[00:21:19 -> 00:21:24]  another you have the electron clouds of two atoms repelling one another and then you have the
[00:21:24 -> 00:21:29]  electron cloud of one atom being attracted to the nucleus of another atom right so there's sort of
[00:21:29 -> 00:21:34]  like a happy medium right there's sort of a happy and by happy medium what i'm what i'm talking
[00:21:34 -> 00:21:42]  about here is the reason why chemical bonds form is because bonding lowers the potential energy
[00:21:42 -> 00:21:48]  of the atoms the potential energy of atoms when they're bonded to one another is lower than the
[00:21:48 -> 00:21:52]  potential energies of those atoms when they're not bonded to one another this is why chemical
[00:21:52 -> 00:21:59]  bonds form because both chemical and physical systems tend to act in a way that minimizes
[00:21:59 -> 00:22:03]  potential energy wherever possible potential energy of course being the energy that is
[00:22:03 -> 00:22:10]  associated with the position or the composition of an object right so the classic example of like
[00:22:10 -> 00:22:15]  potential energy uh you'd say something like this so like i have like this battery uh that i'm
[00:22:15 -> 00:22:21]  holding up really high right this battery has a fairly large amount of localized potential energy
[00:22:21 -> 00:22:27]  because its position way high up in earth's gravitational field right this physical system
[00:22:27 -> 00:22:32]  is going to minimize its potential energy whenever possible which is why when i drop the barrier
[00:22:34 -> 00:22:41]  that holds up the battery it spontaneously falls down right so all right i have a couple messages
[00:22:41 -> 00:22:45]  in the chat that i'm going to read let's see offspring freaks as well said i think touching
[00:22:45 -> 00:22:49]  on each one quickly is a good idea having visuals as you speak on them would be ideal
[00:22:49 -> 00:22:55]  for me at least thank you for that uh kitty says hey green a chemist oh welcome kitty nice to see
[00:22:55 -> 00:23:01]  you uh adiola aziz says i think you've giving introduction already let's just move on please
[00:23:01 -> 00:23:06]  all right thank you yes thank you for all that feedback i appreciate it right so we know what a
[00:23:06 -> 00:23:11]  chemical bond is we know why bonds form it lowers potential energy um ionic and covalent bonding
[00:23:11 -> 00:23:18]  important that we understand that ionic is just the the transfer of electrons typically from a metal
[00:23:18 -> 00:23:23]  which tends to lose electrons to a non-metal which tends to gain electrons right and the ionic bond is
[00:23:23 -> 00:23:29]  just the electrostatic interaction uh that takes place between those oppositely charged ions right
[00:23:29 -> 00:23:37]  covalent bonding as we know is the sharing of electrons between two non-metals also important
[00:23:37 -> 00:23:41]  that we understand the difference between non-polar and polar covalent bonding right
[00:23:41 -> 00:23:48]  so the term polar covalent bond applies to a bond in which the two atoms that are bonded together
[00:23:48 -> 00:23:54]  have a large difference in electronegativity that is they have uh different tendencies to
[00:23:54 -> 00:24:00]  attract electrons uh to themselves right so a polar covalent bond has two atoms bonded together
[00:24:00 -> 00:24:05]  with a significant difference in electronegativity between them uh which basically means that the
[00:24:05 -> 00:24:09]  electrons although they are being shared between the two atoms they're being shared unequally the
[00:24:09 -> 00:24:15]  more electronegative element tends to hog up some more of that electron density within that covalent
[00:24:15 -> 00:24:21]  bond and then if the electronegativity difference is very high uh then you get a full-blown ionic
[00:24:21 -> 00:24:27]  bond uh where you have a complete transfer of one or more electrons uh from like i said typically a
[00:24:27 -> 00:24:33]  metal uh to a non-metal um and then finally um we're going to look at uh the chemical bonding
[00:24:33 -> 00:24:37]  theories uh that we talked about in general chemistry very very important that we understand
[00:24:37 -> 00:24:40]  this because a lot of the organic chemistry stuff that we're going to talk about in the coming
[00:24:40 -> 00:24:47]  streams is going to draw upon this knowledge right so one of them is the lewis theory which is kind
[00:24:47 -> 00:24:52]  of a primitive bonding theory but we still use it today because it does provide a lot of value
[00:24:52 -> 00:24:57]  right so what does lewis theory tell us it basically just tells us uh within a molecule
[00:24:57 -> 00:25:02]  which atoms are connected to which and what's going on with the valence electrons are they
[00:25:02 -> 00:25:09]  participating in bonding or are they lone pairs as they called electron pairs that are localized
[00:25:09 -> 00:25:16]  on individual atoms uh within a molecule right and so with lewis theory we have lewis dot structures
[00:25:16 -> 00:25:21]  very important that we're able to draw lewis dot structures for individual atoms and also that we're
[00:25:21 -> 00:25:28]  able to draw lewis dot structures for simple small molecules right so at this stage in your chemistry
[00:25:28 -> 00:25:36]  education you should be able to given the formula for a molecular compound a simple small molecule
[00:25:36 -> 00:25:44]  you should be able to draw the lewis dot structure for that compound right and within lewis dot
[00:25:44 -> 00:25:50]  structures of course we have things called uh we have a formal charge right and resonance and we're
[00:25:50 -> 00:25:55]  going to go through those um more thoroughly too because those are also very very important
[00:25:55 -> 00:26:00]  uh and then we also have valence bond theory so valence bond theory which includes the topic of
[00:26:00 -> 00:26:08]  hybridization uh basically categorizes a or characterizes a chemical bond as an overlap
[00:26:08 -> 00:26:14]  of atomic orbitals right and then so hybridization is kind of a big one uh that confuses a lot of
[00:26:14 -> 00:26:19]  people so the basic idea behind hybridization is that you have atomic orbitals mixing together
[00:26:19 -> 00:26:26]  to form hybrid orbitals and the advantage that the atoms enjoy when they form hybrid orbitals
[00:26:26 -> 00:26:32]  is that hybrid orbitals tend to overlap better with other atoms than just standard atomic orbitals do
[00:26:32 -> 00:26:38]  right so if you have a better overlap of orbitals right that's going to give you a lower potential
[00:26:38 -> 00:26:45]  energy right and so by forming hybrid orbitals those central atoms like carbon can form more
[00:26:45 -> 00:26:50]  bonds to other atoms and forming more bonds uh leads to a lower potential energy and so you get
[00:26:50 -> 00:26:56]  you know s orbitals or you get the s orbital in a in the uh energy level mixing with p orbitals
[00:26:56 -> 00:27:02]  to produce hybrids right if you have one s orbital and three p orbitals together that'll give you
[00:27:02 -> 00:27:08]  four sp3 hybrids if you have the s orbital combining with two p orbitals you'll have three
[00:27:08 -> 00:27:14]  sp2 hybrid orbitals and then finally if you have an s orbital combining with one p orbital you'll
[00:27:14 -> 00:27:23]  have uh two or you'll have one sp hybrid orbital right that's valence bond theory uh it's also
[00:27:23 -> 00:27:27]  pretty important although perhaps not as important as valence bond theory but it's also very important
[00:27:27 -> 00:27:34]  that we understand molecular orbital theory right so bonding and anti-bonding molecular orbitals
[00:27:34 -> 00:27:39]  and again i i know i've said this several times already but everything that is in this bulleted
[00:27:39 -> 00:27:44]  list i have videos for all of it so if you're watching live i apologize i don't have those
[00:27:44 -> 00:27:48]  links in the description mostly because i kind of want you guys to stick around don't want you
[00:27:48 -> 00:27:53]  to click away uh but if you come back after this is published as a video all of that information
[00:27:53 -> 00:27:58]  all those links all those videos that'll help bring you up to speed if you're a little rusty
[00:27:58 -> 00:28:05]  on these topics will be there for you in one convenient location uh and then the last topic
[00:28:05 -> 00:28:10]  within chemical bonding um that's really really important that's on this list is molecular shape
[00:28:10 -> 00:28:17]  which is governed by vesper theory vsepr valence shell electron pair repulsion based on the fairly
[00:28:17 -> 00:28:22]  simple idea that electrons being negatively charged are going to repel one another around
[00:28:22 -> 00:28:28]  a central atom to try to space whatever atoms are bonded to that central atom as far as apart
[00:28:28 -> 00:28:34]  from one another so if you have two electron pairs around the atom you'll get a linear shape
[00:28:34 -> 00:28:39]  three electron pairs around the atom that'll give you a trigonal planar shape with a bond angle
[00:28:39 -> 00:28:47]  of 180 degrees or 120 degrees rather if you have four electron pairs around a central atom
[00:28:47 -> 00:28:52]  that starts to you start to go into the third dimension right that results in a three-dimensional
[00:28:52 -> 00:29:00]  shape uh and that that that geometry is called tetrahedral with a bond angle of 109.5 degrees
[00:29:00 -> 00:29:06]  and then to get molecular geometry from electron pair geometry you basically just consider the
[00:29:06 -> 00:29:12]  effect that removing one of those electron groups has so in other words let's say you have a
[00:29:12 -> 00:29:17]  tetrahedral electron geometry with four electron pairs right and if you were to sort of hide one
[00:29:17 -> 00:29:21]  of them what would that resulting shape look like well it would look kind of like a pyramid so we
[00:29:21 -> 00:29:27]  call it trigonal pyramidal so again i know i'm kind of blazing through this pretty fast um but
[00:29:27 -> 00:29:31]  again the reason why i'm blazing through this pretty fast because this is all stuff that we
[00:29:31 -> 00:29:40]  should know well at this point if you don't then you know you can watch my content on it or watch
[00:29:40 -> 00:29:45]  other content or read up on it i don't necessarily care where you learn the content from but what i'm
[00:29:45 -> 00:29:49]  really afraid of is i don't want you i don't want to start blazing through organic stuff
[00:29:49 -> 00:29:54]  um and i don't want you to get confused because you don't have a solid foundation of the
[00:29:55 -> 00:30:00]  necessary general chemistry knowledge that we need to study organic chemistry
[00:30:01 -> 00:30:07]  so there it is folks so that is basically it like i said i just wanted to provide
[00:30:07 -> 00:30:15]  a very very gentle introduction to the topic of organic chemistry and i think i did i mean like i
[00:30:15 -> 00:30:24]  said it was a very gentle introduction um obviously one of you adiola uh is um you know wants to just
[00:30:24 -> 00:30:30]  kind of move on and start getting into the the guts of organic chemistry i definitely understand
[00:30:30 -> 00:30:35]  being eager to do that but like i said i just wanted to do a very very gentle introduction
[00:30:35 -> 00:30:43]  today um but i also again what i want really want is to respond to your feedback so what exactly i
[00:30:43 -> 00:30:47]  just want to know more about you like what are you studying right now are you in college are you
[00:30:47 -> 00:30:52]  taking organic chemistry right now you are taking organic chemistry right now what are you currently
[00:30:52 -> 00:30:57]  studying um maybe you're going to be taking organic chemistry soon maybe in the summer or next fall or
[00:30:57 -> 00:31:03]  something like that really i just want to know where you guys are at uh so that i can make content
[00:31:03 -> 00:31:09]  that's more tailored to you so all right everyone that is going to do it this has been the introduction
[00:31:09 -> 00:31:17]  to the organic chemistry uh next week i'll do one of two things i'll either go through those general
[00:31:17 -> 00:31:23]  chemistry concepts in more thorough detail or we will just move right into the organic stuff
[00:31:23 -> 00:31:31]  talking about probably alkanes and cycloalkanes um and things like that um i also want to talk about
[00:31:32 -> 00:31:36]  you know some of the organic chemistry conventions that you don't really learn in organic or in
[00:31:36 -> 00:31:42]  general chemistry uh like the condensed structural formulas uh using curved arrows to show the
[00:31:42 -> 00:31:49]  direction of electron flow within a reaction or within a mechanism um all those things so yeah it's
[00:31:49 -> 00:31:53]  organic chemistry is kind of a challenging subject to teach because there's not really necessarily
[00:31:53 -> 00:32:00]  like a straight linear path to teaching it um there's a lot of ways that we could go about
[00:32:00 -> 00:32:04]  doing this so that's kind of what i'm trying to figure out from you guys is what you guys want to
[00:32:04 -> 00:32:09]  look at first what you guys want to look at later and uh to that end i say please please leave me
[00:32:09 -> 00:32:15]  your feedback please leave a comment and i would appreciate reading your feedback so that i can um
[00:32:16 -> 00:32:21]  make a better decision about uh what to do for the next stream all right everybody love you guys
[00:32:21 -> 00:32:25]  thank you very much for watching really really excited about this project like i said before i
[00:32:25 -> 00:32:32]  hope you are as excited as i am and i will see you in the next episode of the organic chemistry
[00:32:33 -> 00:32:34]  take care everyone
