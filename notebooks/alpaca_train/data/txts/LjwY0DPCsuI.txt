[00:00:00 -> 00:00:02]  So today we've got something really
[00:00:02 -> 00:00:05]  No, this isn't gonna work for today. Hold on. So I'm coming to you today
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:08]  Not from the usual studio, obviously
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:12]  But from a freezing cold beach in West Seattle because we're talking about Team Seas today
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:20]  We're talking about saving beaches oceans and rivers and it's October and it's Seattle. So it's absolutely freezing out here
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:25]  Normally in a video I'd have to take some time out to talk to you about CuriosityStream and Nebula
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:31]  But today they've graciously donated their sponsored time so that we can talk about Team Seas and saving the ocean
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:36]  The people behind Team Seas are Mark Rober and Mr. Beast. If you remember back in 2019, they launched Team Trees
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:40]  They tried to raise 20 million dollars to plant 20 million trees
[00:00:40 -> 00:00:43]  They wound up absolutely smashing that goal with 23 million
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:49]  Even two years later Team Trees is still receiving donations and still planting trees all over the world
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:56]  So we're back today talking about pulling trash out of the oceans rivers and beaches and we're trying to raise 30 million dollars
[00:00:56 -> 00:01:01]  The two nonprofits behind this are the Ocean Conservancy and the Ocean Cleanup. They're gonna split a hundred percent of the proceeds
[00:01:02 -> 00:01:04]  50-50 so the mission here is to remove
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:10]  85 football fields worth of trash piled a foot high. Here's how we're gonna do it for the beaches
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:17]  We'll look to Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup or ICC Network is the largest beach cleanup network in the world
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:21]  They've removed over 340 million pounds of trash so far in its 35 year history
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:28]  Ocean Conservancy's global ghost gear initiative will go out looking for lost abandoned and discarded fishing gear or ghost gear
[00:01:28 -> 00:01:34]  It's some of the deadliest ocean trash and it's really tough to recover and for the rivers Team Seas will fund ocean cleanups
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:40]  Interceptors these are cutting-edge river cleanup technologies that collect trash before it can reach the ocean ocean cleanups
[00:01:40 -> 00:01:46]  Interceptors take care of trash and plastic flowing from 1% of the rivers that contribute to 80% of the trash
[00:01:46 -> 00:01:50]  Flowing into the ocean. This is something that's very near and dear to my heart for two reasons number one
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:57]  Mr. Beast has always really inspired me to be able to use my platform to impact the world in some way aside from just talking
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:01]  To you about keyboards number two. I visited Seattle in the summer of 2019
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:04]  I'm from the Midwest Kansas City, and it's a great city
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:10]  But it wouldn't be a stretch to say that nothing really ever happens there when you talk about stuff like climate change and ecology concerns
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:15]  It's not really top of mind out there coming out here in the summer of 2019
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:18]  I was blown away that when you like turned on the news you heard about
[00:02:18 -> 00:02:25]  Orcas and wildlife and climate change and everything else and it really impacted me in such a way that I went back to Kansas City
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:27]  And we made plans to move here a year later
[00:02:27 -> 00:02:32]  And we did exactly that our oceans rivers and beaches are already full of plastic trash
[00:02:32 -> 00:02:39]  There's an estimated 200 million tons in circulation in marine environments 30 million dollars is an absolutely insane goal
[00:02:39 -> 00:02:42]  So today you're gonna see a bunch of videos going up from a bunch of different
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:49]  Youtubers talking about this very same message and we're all gonna work together to try to make this happen if you're able to help support
[00:02:49 -> 00:02:51]  This thing or you just want to learn more click the link down in the description
[00:02:52 -> 00:02:58]  Every dollar helps and I'm personally gonna get things kicked off with a $500 donation. We are gonna donate $500
[00:02:58 -> 00:03:03]  I'm gonna get out of here and back to the comfort of my studio because it is absolutely freezing
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:05]  I will catch you guys in the next one. Stay up
[00:03:12 -> 00:03:15]  You
