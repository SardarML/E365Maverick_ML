 a way of life is under attack the patients are literally gasping  It's us versus them  Ford has veiled threats to use nuclear weapons  They say he was using ankle beads to kill  How do you say it?  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy  Liv, look at this  Can you believe it?  That is outrageous  Quick, comment how stupid and awful he is  People need to be reminded  Okay  Wait, what if this just gives him more attention?  Who cares? He can't just get away with it  True  I just can't believe anyone is this ignorant  Okay, so comment, let us know  In fact, maybe do a quote tweet so your followers see it too  So today I want to talk about rage  Because doesn't it feel like everyone is going a little mad lately?  Especially online  I swear, every day some new thing comes up  That might start out completely innocuous  But will inevitably devolve into some politicized nightmare  Of left versus right  Trends and counter trends  Where everyone is just screaming at each other through the digital void  It's also miserable and hostile  And yet, so weirdly addictive  I've lost count of how many times I've got sucked into some online debate  Even though I didn't even want to  I even had to get one of these stupid safes to keep my phone in  Because the online world is so ever-present and tempting  It's almost like there's some insidious force acting through it  Trying to get its hooks into my brain so I can go online and do its bidding  You cannot hide  And my personal issues aside  I wanted to talk about this because  Well frankly, this is getting really scary  Because not only are we seeing more and more radicalization  And civil unrest here at home  But this is increasingly starting to affect our chances of solving  These really big global coordination problems  Like climate change and pandemics and arms races  Which require us to come together to solve  And instead we're getting torn more and more apart  So what the hell is going on?  Are we acting this way because everything really is falling apart  Or is it more that our perception of the world is getting twisted  Which is making us crazy  And then sort of turning this all into a big self-fulfilling prophecy  Well as always, the answer is far from simple  Because it's certainly true that there are plenty of individuals out there  Who are directly profiting from all this drama  But the thing is, there's something even deeper at play here  A force far more reckless than any one individual company  A force so powerful it can infect an entire industry  And turn that industry from one of our greatest tools  Into one of our greatest threats  Whether it's the Matrix or the Terminator  At this point we're all pretty familiar with the trope of  Humans naively building a powerful machine to serve them  But then the machine takes over and makes them serve it  You have 20 seconds to comply  Movies have been telling this story for years  In fact, it dates all the way back to 1927  In the silent film called Metropolis  Metropolis tells the story of this futuristic, seemingly utopian city  That seems great on the surface  Until we learn that deep underground  There's a huge machine which demands the blood, sweat and tears  Of poor workers in order to keep everything running  Pretty dark stuff for the time  And remarkably prophetic  Given that it was written nearly 100 years ago  And that today we are increasingly at the mercy  Of a giant machine of our own creation  Except that instead of cogs, ours is made of bits  And instead of feeding on flesh, it feeds on our attention  That's right folks, I'm talking about our media industry  Which of course up close is made up of lots of individual people  But from a zoomed out view  Essentially functions as this giant digitised attention processing machine  That our species built in order to spread its news information  More efficiently around the globe  And back in the pre-internet days  The machine was really just a small number of companies  That kind of controlled all the news flow  In a very centralised power structure  And of course nowadays we have social media too  As well as those old legacy companies  And so it's become this curious combination  Of both top-down broadcasts  And bottom-up user-generated content  Both kind of feeding into each other  While everyone competes in a giant game  Of who can win the most attention  But this doesn't inherently have to be a bad thing, right?  Like machines have made our lives so much better over the years  As has capitalism, which is ultimately driven by this competitive process  So in theory, having a highly data-driven  Competitive media ecosystem  Should allow the cream to rise to the top  So that only the most high-quality information  Is what ends up getting spread  And yet, here we are  So where the hell is it all going wrong?  Again, those Metropolis writers were strangely insightful  Because in that scene where the underground machine is first revealed  The film's protagonist has a sudden vision  That there is something even deeper  And more malevolent controlling it  Almost like something demonic has taken hold of it  A monster that consumes its victims as a sacrifice  In exchange for power  And the name of that monster is Moloch  Now the legend of Moloch originally comes from a Bible story  About this war-obsessed cult who are so desperate for victory  They sacrifice their literal children to it  In exchange for military power  Awful stuff  But these days, it's better known as the god of unhealthy competition  In other words, the force of bad incentives  Where players in a game end up sacrificing  More and more of their other values  In order to get a short-term advantage  Which forces all their competitors to do the same thing  But then everyone ends up worse off than before  So like when businesses cut corners on environmental protections  To boost profits  Or like when athletes give in to illegal doping  Because they feel like all their competitors are doing it anyway  Or when countries pour more and more of their GDP into military defence  Because otherwise they'll be left vulnerable to their enemies  And if you saw my video The Beauty Wars  You'll remember how I covered myself in face filters  To explain how these same Moloch-y forces  Are driving this epidemic of body dysmorphia  On various social media platforms  But seeing as today we're talking about the whole media industry itself  Allow me to introduce you to our new star  The Media Moloch  Good afternoon and welcome to Look At This News  Now we've got a lot of stories lined up for you today  Although first, let me just say  Live  Just because a bunch of teenagers are too dumb to realise  That staring at Kardashianified versions of themselves all day long  Is going to be bad for them  Doesn't mean the same thing applies to all the good folks out there  Who are just trying to keep themselves educated on world events  They are just being responsible  And my media company is just keeping them informed  Well, perhaps that would be true  If you guys painted an accurate picture of the world  But that's not your goal, is it Moloch?  Otherwise you wouldn't be putting such an inflammatory spin on every damn story  So you're clearly optimising for something else  The world is falling apart out there  And you're saying that we're overblowing it?  Sounds like you're the evil one  Yes, obviously there are countless awful things happening every single day  As has always been the case throughout history  But there are so many positive things happening all the time too  Random acts of kindness, disease eradication  Where are all your stories about those?  Like, I can go scroll through any major news outlet  Across the political spectrum  And the ratio of negative to positive stories is just absurd  Like, why not just show a little more balance?  Well, we all know why  Because bad news sells better  And the media have been capitalising on the negativity bias  Well, since the dawn of the printing press  In fact, here's a study that measures the tone of world events  As they've been reported by Wikipedia  You can see the very clearly rough times during the major world wars  But aside of that, the vibe has trended pretty positively  Since the end of World War II  But according to the media, things have gotten more negative over that time  So someone is clearly getting it wrong  And if I had to guess whose reporting is more accurate  Media companies, whose primary goal is to win eyeballs  To keep their shareholders happy  Versus the hive mind of thousands of Wikipedia historians  Well, I know who I'm betting on  Okay, so we focus on the negative stuff a little more than we should  But no one cares about good news  And look how many shares all my stories are getting  I'm clearly just giving the people what they want  Yeah, but are you actually?  Because, like, we know people can get sucked into addiction or into cults  You know, down social media rabbit holes  And the trouble is, we tend to assume it only ever happens to other people  It's really hard to spot when we're the ones being manipulated  But we really are  And it's not just by sketchy social media algorithms  Trying to get us hooked on their feeds either  The legacy media are absolutely at it too  Like on Google, the New York Times' project Feels, for starters  Which uses advanced data science techniques  To predict emotional responses to their articles  So that their advertisers can better serve ads according to people's moods  And then, of course, there's the awkward fact  That news media directly profits from political tension  Like, no one boosted the profits of both the right wing  And the left wing news outlets more than Trump  Even though half of them claim they hated him  So no wonder polarisation is getting worse  Your attention game is getting more competitive than ever  And our anger is the cash cow keeping half your companies alive  But your species have so many human emotions  Why is it always angry tribalism you fall into?  Yeah, well, we do normally have quite a nice wide range of emotions  The thing is, we don't just read our news anymore  We interact with it  And we've built these incredibly powerful  But also really dumb algorithms  That are simply designed to just maximise engagement no matter what  And it seems like anger is like rocket fuel for that  Because it's not only a negative emotion  It's also a very active one that triggers us into action  You know, to go and defend our tribe  And so it gets amplified way beyond how people would naturally behave  Yes, but we need all this delicious anger  We've got inequality and climate change  Pandemics, lying, self-serving politicians  Doesn't it just make you furious?  Of course it does  But these are insanely complex coordination problems  That are already at the limits of our collective intelligence  So they need us to be calm and rational  And work together to solve them  And instead we're getting whipped into this rabid frenzy  By both arms of the media machine  We've got algorithms whose crappy design  Act like some kind of heat-seeking missile  For the most divisive, insane opinions  And then we've got an increasingly desperate  And click-baity legacy media  Whose journalists now source more and more of their stories  From social media in a kind of feedback loop from hell  And meanwhile you, through your machine  Grow ever more powerful by the day  As you perversely use us to go out and document  The worst events on earth  And then mainline them straight back into our limbic systems  In 4K 24-7  Essentially reducing our glorious species  Into a mindless factory farm of rage-porn junkies  For apparently no reason but maximising third-party advertising dollars  Until we all fucking kill each other!  So, there we go  First thing I want to say is  I don't have some kind of vendetta  Against all media people  Or all journalists  In fact, it's kind of a quirk of the English language  That we use the same word to describe someone  Who literally risks their life  Reporting from a war zone  As a click-bait peddler  Who's just optimising for whatever  The most profitable spin of the day is  But even then, those guys  Are often forced to write that way  By their editors  And their editors are told what narratives to push  By their bosses  Who are all beholden to their shareholders  All trapped in Moloch's web  And while that doesn't absolve any of them  From their individual responsibility  We have to remember that  It is the real enemy here  Not any individual member of the media  And certainly not one another  Although now you're probably thinking  Ah, so Moloch is capitalism  No, it's certainly something  That can act through capitalism  But it's much more fundamental  Than any kind of economic structure  Because it's a force of game theory  Another way you can think of it  Is as a sort of personification  Of that mindless force  Of disharmony  That causes a cell to turn cancerous  It's the mindset of  Winning for winning's sake  At the cost of everything else  So then, how do we get Moloch out of our media?  Well, there's no easy answer  To that question, unfortunately  Otherwise, we probably would have done it already  But there is some hope  Because it needs two sort of key ingredients  In order to thrive  Firstly, it needs a poorly designed  Competitive system  And then secondly, it needs  A minimum number of individuals within that system  Who are unable to resist  Its bad incentives  Now with the first one, well luckily right now  There's some opportunity to redesign social media  Algorithms away from divisiveness  And rage, and more towards  Better sense-making and information  And just generally making them more fun  And as for the second one  Well, that's on all of us, right?  Because our consumption habits  Directly shape the type of content  That gets made in the first place  And one way I've personally found helpful  Is to start muting, or at least  Ignoring anyone  Particularly any politicians  Who build the majority of their personal brand  Around attacking the other side  You know, pointing out what's wrong with the bad guys  Without offering any more productive  Better solutions  Because if someone's whole thing is about just  Tearing others down, then it's just  More repetition of the Moloch mindset  You know, this zero-sum-ness that is so destructive  Also, I really love this Perception Gap website  Which runs surveys and polls  To measure what Democrats and Republicans  Actually think about an issue  But then also what they think the other side  Think about that same issue  And lo and behold, there is a big gap  In what those two things are  In other words, the average person's views  On both sides are much closer  Than what the media machine has led everyone to believe  And then of course  There's the tried and tested technique  Of steelmanning the other side  Steelmanning the other side  Is the latest breakthrough in cognitive technology  To help those suffering  From algorithmically amplified  Rage and hatred  Listen to your doctor  And if any of you guys  Have any techniques you've personally found helpful  At reducing your own online rage  Please share them below in the comments  On that note, thank you so much for watching  And remember, don't hate the players  Change the game  Thanks for watching!
