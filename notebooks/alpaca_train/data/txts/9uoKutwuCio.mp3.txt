[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  In this section, we're going to prove some identities, and to do these problems, you need to have memorized those basic identities,
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:12]  the reciprocal, ratio, and Pythagorean identities. And then, we're going to put those identities together with a little bit of algebra,
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:16]  and prove some more difficult identities. Here's our first one.
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:23]  We want to prove that cosθ times tanθ is equal to sinθ. So, I'll start with the more complicated side,
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:35]  and I'm going to take cosθ, tanθ, and rewrite it as cosθ times sinθ over cosθ,
[00:00:35 -> 00:00:42]  using my ratio identity that says tanθ is always sinθ over cosθ.
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:49]  Now, I'll divide out the common factor cosθ, and that simplifies into sinθ.
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:55]  So, I've succeeded in taking this expression, and with a little bit of identities from trigonometry,
[00:00:55 -> 00:01:03]  and a little bit of algebra here, simplifying it into sinθ. So, I've proved that cosθ times tanθ is always equal to sinθ.
[00:01:03 -> 00:01:12]  Here's our next one. I want to show that cosx times cosx plus tanx is equal to cotx plus sinx.
[00:01:12 -> 00:01:18]  So, I think I'll start on this side, on the more complicated side here, and I'm going to apply my distributive property,
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:35]  and multiply cosx times both of these terms here. So, when I do that, I'll have cosx times cosecant x plus cosx times tangent x.
[00:01:35 -> 00:01:44]  And let's see, I have cosx times cosecant is 1 over sinx. So, I can use that reciprocal identity.
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:57]  And then, I'll have cosx here times, I'm going to change this to sines and cosines using my ratio identity that tanx is sinx over cosx.
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:04]  Now, I'm keeping an eye on this side. I want to change this side into this side. So, I'm going to need a sinx and a cotx.
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:17]  I think I've got it here. cosx times 1 over sinx is cosx over sinx, plus, that's my plus sign here, cosx times sine over cosine.
[00:02:17 -> 00:02:25]  I'll divide out that common factor of cosine, and I have left sinx. And so, I see I've succeeded in getting what I want here,
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:40]  cosx over sinx, using my ratio identity, that's cotx plus sinx. And I've succeeded in changing the left side of this expression of this identity
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:46]  into the right side. So, I've essentially proved this identity. So, you can see by watching what I've done right here,
[00:02:46 -> 00:02:53]  that you need to know those basic identities, reciprocal identities, ratio identities, and Pythagorean identities, to be able to do these problems.
[00:02:53 -> 00:03:06]  Here's another one. I have cos4t minus sin4t, over sin2t, is equal to cot2t minus 1. So, I'm going to start with this side here,
[00:03:06 -> 00:03:12]  and I'm going to start by factoring the difference of two squares here, since fourth powers are also squares.
[00:03:12 -> 00:03:31]  And so, when I do that, I'll get cos2t plus sin2t, times cos2t minus sin2t, and that's all divided by sin2t.
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:39]  Now, I look and see here, I have cos2t plus sin2t, and I know that that is simply equal to 1.
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:53]  So, I have 1 times cos2t minus sin2t. So, this is going to be equal to cos2t minus sin2t, all over sin2t,
[00:03:53 -> 00:04:00]  using my Pythagorean identity that says that this is 1. So, 1 times this is just it itself.
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:07]  Now, let's see, I look over here, I want cot2t minus 1. Well, if I take this sin2 that divides this numerator,
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:22]  and divide each term in the numerator by it, I'll have what I'm looking for, cos2t over sin2t, minus sin2t over sin2t.
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:32]  And look what I've got here, cos2t over sin2t, that is cot2t minus sin2t over sin2t is 1.
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:36]  So, I've done the same thing here. I've succeeded in changing this side into this side,
[00:04:36 -> 00:04:42]  using just trigonometric identities and a little bit of algebra. So, I've proved this identity.
