 Hi everybody this is Liam Martin and in today's video we're going to be talking  about the 21 essential rules for managing a remote team as defined by me  Liam from Time Doctor. Let's get into it. Tip number one you really have to  compensate for the fact that you're not bumping into each other on a daily basis  if you're running a remote team so Time Doctor has 80 plus employees in 27  different countries all over the world from Canada to Nigeria we have employees  everywhere all over the planet and it's a huge advantage in some capacities but  it's also a huge disadvantage in other capacities and one of the biggest ones  is that you're really not just bumping into people that inside of your  organization like you would if everyone was locally located so inside of virtual  teams you have to really compensate for that natural bumping into people which  is what produces a lot of magic inside of tech startups as an example and very  fast-moving companies where you'll have that intermingling of people that will  be able to produce interesting new ideas and insights that you wouldn't have  otherwise had so with that said I'm going to go on to tip number two which is I  suggest that you have a chat room open constantly we call it the water cooler  inside of our chat so we have one in Skype and we have one inside of Slack and  that basically is a room that you can talk about anything that you  want to talk about if you want to talk about your kids graduation if you want  to talk about a different coding system if you want to talk about the latest  episode of Game of Thrones you can do that in that water cooler chat room and  it really creates that sort of naturalized bumping into that you would  have had inside of a local organization it just gives you that little small talk  that people need to get those bumps and then also more importantly to be  able to give them deeper insights into people that you wouldn't have otherwise  had if you were if you just didn't have access to that type of chat in the first  place tip number three you have to be really  wary of email in chat overload particularly in remote businesses so  this is a problem inside of brick-and-mortar businesses but it's  even worse inside of remote businesses because you get a lot more email and you  get a lot more chat messages so you have to be wary of that you have to  understand and encourage your employees to turn off their chat and turn off  their email when they're finished with their workday as an example so they're  not answering emails at three o'clock in the morning like I was today  unfortunately you need to really make sure that that stuff is controlled  because otherwise that works into every aspect of their lives and makes them  unhappy and at the end of the day less productive employees tip number four I  talk about the levels of importance as it applies to communication so video is  the most important level of communication then it is audio then it is  chat then it is email in that order so if you can always have video chats with  people if you can't have a video chat have an audio call with somebody you  can't have an audio call have a live chat with them and if you can't do that  then go to email that's the way you should be basically orienting yourself  inside of the organization it's really important to make sure you have those  levels because email is very slow video is very fast so if you need something  done quickly and efficiently video is probably the best way to do it tip  number five if you can't do a video chat with somebody one of the best ways  to communicate exactly what you need done is through video or visualization  communication tools so I use a tool called Jing and what it is and allows  you to do is you can draw a box on your computer screen and it will give you  five minutes for free it gives you unlimited data if you're if you pay the  $5 a month or something like that for Jing and you'll be able to record a  screen capture of exactly what you want done inside of your company so let's say  that you want some edits done to a particular website well you can do a  video outlining exactly what you want done and why something wasn't done  correctly or was done correctly and the old adage of pictures worth a thousand  words well a video is worth like a hundred thousand words that's why we're  doing video right now as well to be able to communicate to you like this you need  to make sure that you're as information rich as humanly possible when you  communicate so if you can't do a video call use one of these video tools like  Jing to be able to really get more richness into an email or a chat message  that you're going to send tip number six video conferencing technology is  critical because as I said before video is the most information rich form of  communication that you can have inside of your remote team so what I suggest  you do is if your budget is quite low get on Skype Skype is free if you have a  little bit more of a budget zoom is more expensive but much better as a tool to  be able to work and collaborate through video with co-workers that are remote  and even if you want to get started very quickly and easily something like Google  Apps will have a Google Hangouts feature inside of Google Apps that you can use  like a zoom or a Skype so any of those three options are absolutely fantastic  if you're looking at increasing your video communication or you haven't made  that decision yet and you really want to actually deploy one of these tools  inside of your organization tip number nine what you need to do is set up a  meeting rhythm what doesn't get measured doesn't get managed and if you're not  meeting with people on a set time to a set rhythm then people can get very  distracted and they're not focused on executing on their work so what I would  suggest that you do is you either set up a daily meeting with people a weekly  meeting with people or a bi-weekly meeting with people I think that you  should not be meeting with people less than once a week if you end up meeting  with people monthly you just won't get anything done and they may go in a  completely separate direction that you didn't really intend them to go in so  make sure that it's either daily bi-weekly or weekly and make sure that  meeting you have very clear identifiable goals that everyone needs to meet we  call them KPIs and you then need for them to give you a report on where their  current KPIs are basically what they did last week what they're planning on doing  next week and any blockers or issues that they need to report back to you so  that you can help solve that problem for them and if you can execute on that  you'll have a beautiful meeting rhythm you just need to be able to keep that  reliability inside of the organization tip number 10 you need effective  collaboration on documents and spreadsheets and I would suggest that  you use Google Apps it's really easy they're all virtual documents but  whatever documents you're trying to use make sure that they are in the cloud so  that you can edit them live so all of these different employees can go into a  single document and then you can add and delete information you can edit  information you can see the different versions you can see what people have  added and what people have taken away as an example Google Apps does this  beautifully it's very cheap but there are plenty of other products on the  market like Apple also has a version of this and then Microsoft also has a  version of this type of these types of applications that you can use so whatever  you're using it doesn't really matter as long as they are in the cloud and  collaborative it's absolutely critical if you're going to run a remote team tip  number 11 set up a project management system and actually use it I'm blown  away with people who constantly do not use their project management systems and  for us it's so important in a remote organization to make sure that  everything is documented because when stuff is in your head it unfortunately  can't be communicated to the rest of the organization and even in comparison to a  local organization where you'll have a lot of just the general communication  that happens saying oh yeah I put out that memo or yeah I solved that problem  isn't communicated inside of a remote organization because you're not having  those natural bumps in communication sort of happenstance that you would have  in a local organization so you need a project management system you need to  use it religiously and everything needs to go into that project management  system I would suggest something like a sauna base camp there's a couple other  Jira as an example is another one that's really great for development and there's  a ton of other project management tools on the market you just have to choose  one and actually execute on putting stuff into it and making sure that your  team is answerable to putting stuff inside of that project management tool  if they're not doing it you're losing millions of dollars not by doing it tip  number 12 you've got to implement systems this is one of the biggest  problems that I see when people are working remotely you must have  processes inside of your organization if you have a remote business so I'll  give you a perfect example we're making these videos right now there's a process  for how the video is edited how the video is exported do we have an  Instagram story 15 second snippet that we also pull outside of that initial  edit inside of Final Cut do we use a multi cam or do we use a single camera  system how does the audio look have we checked for audio are we going to  promote it in the right way what are the tags underneath that video what do  we write underneath that video is this integrated inside of a blog post or not  we have these checklists and these processes and it's really important that  you have these processes inside of your organization because if you're making  one video not that big of a deal if you're making a hundred videos it's a  big deal you need to have those processes in place otherwise just  systems break down and people don't actually know what the heck they're  supposed to be doing so implementing systems is super easy I got a video about  systems that I'm gonna link right up here that you can check out and again  systems get them up and running guys it's just you're you're literally losing  millions and millions of dollars by not implementing stuff like this tip number  13 it's really important to deploy flexible work hours as long as there is  consistency so our mission statement as a company is we want to empower workers  to work wherever they want whenever they want so we don't really care where  you worked or how long you worked as long as you got the job done we're  focused on efficiency not necessarily how long somebody worked that's not a  very good measure of productivity so a part of that is having people to  basically gain access to flexible work agreements inside of our company and we  highly suggest that you also engage in that as well but you need to be able to  make sure that there is some consistency and we usually put this around our  meetings so you must show up for meetings at a particular time and if  you're not showing up for those meetings it's a big issue other than that you do  what you want if you want to work from three o'clock in the morning till six  o'clock in the morning every day go ahead do it as long as you're productive  and you're putting out good results so make sure that you're giving people that  freedom to have their own flexible work hours but keep some consistency keep  those touch points of those meetings every single day or every week as an  example so that they understand that they have to show up and they have a  report that they have to submit saying what they did and what they plan on  doing next day or next week tip number I think I'm on number 16 17 something I'm  just gonna forget about it there's 21 tips so you got a track work hours  attendance and other basic basic measures of productivity so we allow  people to work wherever they want whenever they want and it's really  important that they're measuring how much time they're putting inside of the  business and what the results what results they are getting when they do  that particular type of work so if you have a customer support agent that's  much more productive than another support agent and they're doing exactly  the same amount of work they need to figure out why was that support agent  more productive than that other support agent and the only way that you can do  that is by tracking the amount of time that you worked when you attended work  in other basic measures of productivity so as an example we use time doctor for  that obviously because that's our company I measure all of the websites  applications most movements and keyboard movements that I do inside of our  company I got a laptop right here it's currently tracking this particular task  which is shooting a video and at the end of this I'll be able to figure out how  efficiently I executed on doing that particular task inside of the  organization and whether my time that I spent was actually productive to the  company centrally important when you're building remote teams to be able to have  that type of documentation next tip is you've got to have overlapping hot zones  of communication time when it applies to time zones so I'll give you an  example we usually have meetings on Thursdays and on Mondays which we call  our all points meetings so we have to do two of them we used to do one but we  just have too many people and too many different time zones so we have one on  Thursdays for everyone who is on the Manila time zone and then we have one on  Mondays for people that are on the New York time zone and we do those every  single week and someone has to report to one of those two meetings every single  week it is a requirement and that allows people to have that single touch point  to know that hey there are other people inside of the company here's what  they're doing here's what their lives are about and it really does give you  that sense of community that usually you're lacking inside of remote  organizations that you want to take advantage of next tip do a quarterly  review of how your teammates are doing a lot of people call these 360 reviews you  can just google that the 360 review is going to give you a lot of great  information like what do your co-workers think of this particular worker what  does your manager think of that particular worker what is that worker  think of their manager it's a 360 review it's giving you a whole bunch of  different variables to that particular worker and it's critically important we  do them quarterly and it's a really great way for us to figure out okay what  are you good at what are you not good at how can you improve and then measure  that quarter over quarter to make sure that those employees are going to be a  lot more productive in the long term so in combination with something very  granular like measuring how hard they're working and how efficiently they're  working we also measure things like a 360 quarterly review so that we know  okay how do people perceive of this employee inside of the organization and  what are their advantages or disadvantages next tip you got to test  employees with short-term work before hiring them full-time so my perspective  is I got to work with you before I can work with you so we'll usually hire  people on very short projects we're gonna hire somebody brand new we'll  usually hire two people for that position and we'll hire them on part  time and we'll basically give them both the same tasks over a one month period  and you can very quickly and easily understand who is really great versus  who isn't so good so a lot of the times we'll have someone that will have a  fantastic resume but then when we end up actually working with them in person  they can't actually execute and that happens a lot so you need to be able to  hire those two people hire them on part-time if you can and really  understand where they're at because having that small little project can  completely change your perspective of those initial resumes that you had come  in next tip is pay virtual team members very well if you're hiring in developing  countries you can usually get absolutely fantastic labor at very cost-effective  prices and it's a huge advantage to you to be able to just pay that person 10  20 30 percent higher than the market rate in their particular country you're  still getting a fantastic deal and they are getting a much higher salary they're  going to be more loyal and they're going to be a lot more relaxed about what  they're doing with with their work and the organization's work so I'm blown  away by people that are just going to penny pinch someone who's making $1,000  a month as an example and in comparison to San Francisco you'd be paying $10,000  a month for the same type of work pay them 1,200 make them very happy and  they'll be very successful long-term workers with you over the next couple  years next tip it's really important that you hire people that are the right  fit for virtual work so inside of Time Doctor we actually have a virtual work  fit kind of test that we deploy and that's deployed before we actually look  at their real resume so a couple things that you can kind of just pull off the  top usually remote workers are on the introverted side of the spectrum they're  okay with working alone if they constantly have to be working with other  people virtual work environments are probably not the best environment for  them they need to be people that are very detail oriented and also people  that need to take that can take independent action on particular tasks  without really feeling intimidated that they're making the wrong decision  from their manager so taking that in consideration really look for those  types of people inside of your organization and if you've got them then  it's it's a really easy way for you to say okay this is the model that we  already have we know that there are people that are fit that are a really  great fit inside of our organization and then try to have those people interview  the other employees inside of your company that you want to hire or are  looking to hire and ask them hey you know are those people like you are they  the same type of people and if they aren't then you're probably gonna run  into a problem last tip I'm gonna give you is it's really important to meet in  person so we have team retreats for our entire organization at least once per  year and then we have smaller meetings that we do throughout the year and it's  so important for a virtual team to meet in person at least once number one it's  a great employee perk to have everybody fly into Thailand or fly into Bali or  type fly into Bulgaria or somewhere like that they all love it secondarily the  context that you'll get from those two to three days of everyone being in the  same place is huge people will now know the nonverbal cues that different  co-workers have they'll be able to understand what kind of food they like  what kind of movies they like what kind of TV shows they like what type of beer  they like to drink and those extra little details are huge when you look  at the long-term ROI of building a successful remote business so meet in  person I meet in person with my team every single year I actually meet in  person with my team more than once per year and the team loves it I highly  suggest you take advantage of it so that was my 21 tips on how to manage virtual  teams I think I think I had 21 tips in there if you have a tip please put it  down in the comments below so that I know what the heck you guys want to talk  about and maybe I'll add that into this particular video or make maybe I'll make  another one in the future and if you hit this video give it a thumbs down if you  really like this video give it a thumbs up and other than that I will see you in  the next video
