 In this problem we're given an isosceles trapezoid and a circle that just fits  inside it, and the circle touches at the top and the bottom, but not left to right,  and we're told to find the area of the shaded region. That's this area over here  and over here together. Now to find that area, we will find the area of the  trapezoid and subtract the area of the circle, and what we get, what we have left  after subtracting the circle will be the answer, what we're looking for. So we'll  start by finding the area of the trapezoid, and the formula for the area of  the trapezoid is the average of the two bases times the height, and we need to  draw in the height, and the height is going to be perpendicular to the bases.  So draw that in, we'll call it H. Go ahead and draw it in on both sides. That's H in  both places. Now notice that this forms two little right triangles, one on each  side, and this bottom edge, let's give it a name, we'll call it X, and that will be  the same on both sides. Now we can find X pretty easily. Look at this. This is  length 10 all the way across, and look at this 7.2. If this is 7.2 up here, then from  this point across to this point, that will be 7.2 also. So this means that X  plus 7.2 plus X has to add up to 10. So let's write that. I'll write it like this.  2X plus 7.2 equals 10, and then we'll do a little bit of algebra. Subtract 7.2  from each side, and you get 2X is equal to 2.8, so X is equal to 1.4. Then we can  take one of these small triangles and apply the Pythagorean theorem. I can  write H squared plus 1.4 squared is equal to 5 squared. So H squared, just  rearranging this, will be 5 squared minus 1.4 squared, and we can figure that out.  Let's pull up the calculator. 5 squared minus 1.4 squared is 23.04.  So H will be the square root of that. So the square root of 23.04 is 4.8. So the  height is 4.8. That's my height, H. Now I can find the area of the trapezoid.  That's the area of the trapezoid, and that will be the average of the bases. So that's 7.2 plus 10  divided by 2 times the height, and the height is 4.8. And so we work that out.  7.2 plus 10 divided by 2 times 4.8. I got 41.28 for the area of the trapezoid.  And then the area of the circle, area of a circle, is just pi r squared. Ok now, how do we find the  radius here? Let's draw it in the center to one edge. If you look at the diagram, you can see  that the radius here will be half the height. And that's pretty easy. You can do this in your head.  The height is 4.8, so the radius is 2.4. So the area of the circle will be pi times that radius, 2.4, squared.  So let's calculate that, pi times 2.4 squared. Pi times 2.4 squared comes out to 18. I'll round that to 18.1.  So the area of the circle is equal to 18.1, and so then the area of the shaded region  will be the area of the trapezoid, that's 41.28, minus the area of the circle, minus 18.1.  41.28 minus 18.1 comes out to 23.18. And we're told to round to one decimal place, so that's  23.2.
