[00:00:00 -> 00:00:08]  As your environment grows in complexity, it becomes more and more challenging to detect and respond to security threats.
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:14]  Development and operations teams are increasingly responsible for securing their own services against a vast array of threats,
[00:00:14 -> 00:00:17]  but they may not have time or expertise to do so.
[00:00:17 -> 00:00:26]  At the same time, security teams that do have the expertise often struggle to keep up to speed with the ever-changing state of dynamic, cloud-native environments.
[00:00:26 -> 00:00:31]  That's why we developed Datadog Security Monitoring.
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:39]  Built on our Without Limits platform, security monitoring lets you detect threats in real-time across the full stream of ingested data,
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:42]  without the cost of indexing and retaining everything.
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:49]  Security monitoring leverages hundreds of integrations to give you full visibility into every layer of your production environment.
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:57]  This means everyone in your organization has access to detailed observability data – logs, metrics, traces, and more –
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:01]  providing a single pane of glass to investigate security threats.
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:09]  Datadog provides turnkey detection rules to flag attacker techniques and misconfigurations so that you immediately improve your security posture.
[00:01:09 -> 00:01:17]  And thanks to our simple editor, anyone on your team can customize detection rules or even write their own without needing to learn a proprietary query language.
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:25]  For example, this rule detects a potential account takeover by looking for multiple failed login attempts, followed by a successful one.
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:32]  When a rule triggers – because of an attack, a misconfiguration, or a threat intelligence match – Datadog creates a security signal.
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:38]  Datadog retains all these signals for 15 months so that you can correlate them and identify trends over time.
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:47]  You can quickly filter signals using attributes like severity level, the MITRE attack technique, or any associated entity, such as the attacker's IP.
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:51]  Viewing a signal provides the context needed to triage it quickly.
[00:01:51 -> 00:01:57]  You can check the timeline of the attack, see whether it's still ongoing, and even review actual events that triggered the signal.
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:01]  And because these events are enriched at intake, you can answer questions like,
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:05]  what country is the attack coming from, to help determine whether to kick off a response.
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:13]  During the investigation, you can seamlessly pivot to any other part of Datadog, like infrastructure metrics or process monitoring.
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:23]  With Datadog Security Monitoring, you can now detect potential threats by leveraging all of the observability data generated by your dynamic environment.
[00:02:23 -> 00:02:30]  And with one unified platform, everyone in your organization can work together to secure your infrastructure and applications.
