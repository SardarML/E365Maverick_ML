[00:00:00 -> 00:00:27]  Good morning sunshine, how are you today son?
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:28]  You good?
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:29]  Good.
[00:00:29 -> 00:00:30]  You good too.
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:31]  Thanks for asking.
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:35]  My fellow galavantours, here is what I propose to you today.
[00:00:35 -> 00:00:41]  Me and you will go for a wander through these untroubled and tranquil hinterlands in search
[00:00:41 -> 00:00:44]  of all that is wild and wonderful.
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:48]  In search of the many fine and fanciful things that the natural world has to offer.
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:54]  The trees, the plants, the flowers, the fungi and the wildlife.
[00:00:54 -> 00:00:58]  Nothing will escape documentation today because we National Geographic out here.
[00:00:58 -> 00:01:03]  And upon discovery of an interesting organism, we will use the wonders of botanical science
[00:01:03 -> 00:01:09]  to extract and discover the secrets of what these organisms have to offer.
[00:01:09 -> 00:01:13]  We will discover that which is edible and that which is medicinal.
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:17]  That which is hallucinogenic and everything else in between.
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:22]  So where shall we begin?
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:27]  We shall begin here, with moon daisies, lycanthemum vulgare.
[00:01:27 -> 00:01:28]  Interesting.
[00:01:28 -> 00:01:30]  What is there to be learned here?
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:31]  What are the secrets?
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:35]  Well, I will tell you the secrets.
[00:01:35 -> 00:01:38]  Moon daisies are edible in their entirety.
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:43]  And not only edible, but incredibly high in vitamin C and provitamin A, in the form of
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:44]  beta keratin.
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:48]  Which is useful in the maintenance of immune system function, particularly pertaining to
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:53]  the protective barriers of the skin and the production of lymphocytes, otherwise known
[00:01:53 -> 00:01:54]  as white blood cells.
[00:01:54 -> 00:02:00]  In so, the consumption of moon daisies will serve to fight infection from within, by boosting
[00:02:00 -> 00:02:01]  immune system function.
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:05]  Not only that, but moon daisies boast an antispasmodic property.
[00:02:05 -> 00:02:06]  What does that mean?
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:10]  Well, it just means it will relieve muscular spasms and muscular cramps.
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:12]  Why would you need an antispasmodic?
[00:02:12 -> 00:02:16]  Well if you are an otherwise healthy individual male, then you would not typically need one.
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:20]  But the females, during their menses, during their monthly discharge of blood and cellular
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:25]  debris from the uterus, are probably all too familiar with the agonizing stomach cramps
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:26]  that are associated with that.
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:31]  But moon daisies will work to relieve your menstrual aches and pains, leaving you free
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:35]  to take on the day and resume shopping and buying shoes, or whatever the fuck it is the
[00:02:35 -> 00:02:36]  girls do, I don't know.
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:38]  But here's a secret.
[00:02:38 -> 00:02:43]  Moon daisies, as an ornamental flower, are a fan favourite amongst the females, for their
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:46]  heavenly and harmonious aesthetic appearance.
[00:02:46 -> 00:02:51]  This is a fact, based on very little evidence, but search your feelings, you know it to be
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:52]  true.
[00:02:52 -> 00:02:56]  That if you were to present onto your fair maiden a bouquet of freshly picked moon daisies,
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:01]  a brilliant cluster of fluorescent snow-white inflorescence, then her knickers will drop
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:02]  like a sack of bricks.
[00:03:02 -> 00:03:17]  Oi oi oi, what's all this then?
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:21]  Most elegant, most alluring, most graceful, consider me enamoured.
[00:03:21 -> 00:03:26]  Allow me to introduce you to this flower, whose common name is Speedwell.
[00:03:26 -> 00:03:30]  And now that you're formally acquainted, take a moment to observe the shape and arrangement
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:31]  of its petals.
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:35]  One could say that it possesses quite an angelic aesthetic.
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:40]  A long gown, delicate wings, arms outstretched and welcomely open with a bulbous hooded shroud.
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:45]  This is most glorious, most valiant, most divine, most delightful.
[00:03:45 -> 00:03:46]  But can you eat it?
[00:03:46 -> 00:03:47]  Yes you can.
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:51]  Speedwells are edible, and would make a fine addition to any bowl of slop that you cook
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:53]  up around a campfire.
[00:03:53 -> 00:03:57]  And Speedwells are alleged to possess a taste similar to that of watercress.
[00:03:57 -> 00:04:01]  But I am not personally familiar with the taste of watercress, so I can neither confirm
[00:04:01 -> 00:04:02]  nor deny these allegations.
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:07]  So should you wish to reclaim your lost masculinity by destroying that which is beautiful, and
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:19]  quell your appetite at the same time, then look no further than the Speedwell.
[00:04:19 -> 00:04:26]  Now then, let's just take a moment to bask in the soft, amniotic tranquility of a sun
[00:04:26 -> 00:04:32]  positioned between 0 and 12 degrees in elevation, a temperature a mild 12 degrees celsius, wind
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:38]  speeds of 7 miles per hour, humidity 67%.
[00:04:38 -> 00:04:43]  These are the makings of a rather pleasant enviroment.
[00:04:43 -> 00:04:50]  Excuse me, there was a wasp.
[00:04:50 -> 00:04:55]  What if I told you that these flowers can be used for hunting?
[00:04:55 -> 00:04:59]  Well, that gives you an incentive to listen to me talk about the lovely pretty flowers
[00:04:59 -> 00:05:01]  for three and a half minutes.
[00:05:01 -> 00:05:06]  This flower is known as Lichenis Floscuculli, which sounds like the makings of a rather
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:10]  grievous bacterial infection, but it's common name is Ragged Robin.
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:15]  An appropriate title for a flower of such dilapidated physical appearance.
[00:05:15 -> 00:05:17]  A special snowflake.
[00:05:17 -> 00:05:23]  And special they are indeed, for they possess a multitude of valuable and practical uses,
[00:05:23 -> 00:05:27]  pertaining to the collection of food and domestic cleaning.
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:31]  Hmm, that's an interesting combination, allow me to explain.
[00:05:31 -> 00:05:36]  Ragged Robins are rich in chemicals known as saponins, and the biological purpose of
[00:05:36 -> 00:05:41]  these saponins within the plant is to deter insects and bacteria from feeding upon the
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:47]  live plant, as saponins, when consumed, are toxic to many creatures.
[00:05:47 -> 00:05:51]  But they are not only toxic to insects and bacteria, no no.
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:53]  They are also toxic to fish.
[00:05:53 -> 00:05:59]  So if one were to, hypothetically, take a Ragged Robin plant, crush it and then toss
[00:05:59 -> 00:06:04]  the pulverised plant matter into a body of water, such as a pond or a lagoon, then the
[00:06:04 -> 00:06:10]  saponins will leach out of the plant, dissolve into the water, and poison all the fish.
[00:06:10 -> 00:06:15]  Which will of course then die, and float to the surface for easy collection.
[00:06:15 -> 00:06:21]  This is a practice known as poison fishing, and it is a tactic that has been widely used,
[00:06:21 -> 00:06:25]  both past and present, by indigenous tribal societies.
[00:06:25 -> 00:06:30]  It's the organic equivalent of dropping a live grenade into a pond.
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:33]  That's efficient fishing, those poor Pisces.
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:34]  Happy hunters though.
[00:06:34 -> 00:06:39]  But the tactical acquisition of aquatic food sources aside, saponin rich plants are also
[00:06:39 -> 00:06:41]  used as a cleansing agent.
[00:06:41 -> 00:06:47]  For you see, saponins are renowned for producing a soap-like foam when they are shaken in aquatic
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:49]  environments.
[00:06:49 -> 00:06:54]  So if you were to swish and swirl pulverised Ragged Robins into a cup of water, then the
[00:06:54 -> 00:07:01]  saponins within the plant will begin to fizz, froth, foam and bubble, leaving behind suds.
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:03]  Foamy, frothy soap suds.
[00:07:03 -> 00:07:09]  And these are genuine soap bubbles, because in regards to their chemistry, they are detergents.
[00:07:09 -> 00:07:15]  So if you were to apply the Ragged Robins saponin soap suds to your filthy, dirty skin,
[00:07:15 -> 00:07:22]  then the suds will break down, bind to, and wash away all of your accumulated impurities.
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:28]  All of the otherwise insoluble substances such as the grease, the grime, the pestilence,
[00:07:28 -> 00:07:33]  the blood and the semen, and all of the various oils that are excreted from the body during
[00:07:33 -> 00:07:39]  long periods of physical exertion, can be washed away quite effortlessly, by lathering
[00:07:39 -> 00:07:46]  yourself up in those soapy saponin suds, and then rinsing it all off with a dash of water.
[00:07:46 -> 00:07:47]  Easy peasy.
[00:07:47 -> 00:07:49]  And it's a very effective cleaner.
[00:07:49 -> 00:07:54]  And this is exactly how humble villagers used to clean themselves back in the day.
[00:07:54 -> 00:07:58]  Saponin suds were used as body wash, shampoo, and laundry soap.
[00:07:58 -> 00:08:05]  So lather yourself up in those soapy saponin suds, and then throw yourself in the pond,
[00:08:05 -> 00:08:10]  go for a fun little skinny dip, cleanse yourself of your impurities, and kill all the fish
[00:08:10 -> 00:08:11]  while you're at it.
[00:08:11 -> 00:08:13]  That's two birds, one stone right there.
[00:08:13 -> 00:08:15]  Ah, that's very efficient.
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:19]  But hey, saponins are no rarity.
[00:08:19 -> 00:08:23]  Saponins can also be found in amongst the ubiquitous horse chestnut conker tree, a tree
[00:08:23 -> 00:08:26]  well known for its saponin content.
[00:08:26 -> 00:08:34]  So gather the leaves, crush, soak, shake, and apply for a foamy soap, shampoo, and washing
[00:08:34 -> 00:08:35]  detergent.
[00:08:35 -> 00:08:36]  Bada bing, bada boom.
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:45]  A humble mixture of chemistry and craft, makes for an easy life.
[00:08:45 -> 00:08:48]  Now here's a real interesting one for you.
[00:08:48 -> 00:08:51]  Introducing the morning glory.
[00:08:51 -> 00:08:54]  Ipomoea purpurea.
[00:08:54 -> 00:08:55]  That's a badass name.
[00:08:55 -> 00:08:57]  But morning glory you say?
[00:08:57 -> 00:08:58]  Hmm.
[00:08:58 -> 00:09:00]  Does it have anything to do with morning erections?
[00:09:00 -> 00:09:01]  No.
[00:09:01 -> 00:09:05]  That would be most indecent, but they are renowned for something as equally as exciting.
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:08]  So what's the story?
[00:09:08 -> 00:09:13]  Flowers belonging to the genus of Ipomoea possess a psychoactive and mildly hallucinogenic
[00:09:13 -> 00:09:14]  substance.
[00:09:14 -> 00:09:15]  How so?
[00:09:15 -> 00:09:20]  Well, intrinsic to the seeds of the morning glory flower is a chemical known as D-Lysergic
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:24]  Acidamide, otherwise known as LSA.
[00:09:24 -> 00:09:29]  And LSA is a psychedelic substance, not a particularly potent one, but a psychedelic
[00:09:29 -> 00:09:30]  nonetheless.
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:38]  Even so, fun fact, LSA is the precursor chemical used in the production of LSD, Lysergic Acidamide.
[00:09:38 -> 00:09:39]  You may be familiar.
[00:09:39 -> 00:09:42]  LSD and LSA are chemical brothers.
[00:09:42 -> 00:09:46]  In essence, LSD is just refined LSA.
[00:09:46 -> 00:09:50]  And this is no secret, as the seeds of the morning glory were consumed by the god damn
[00:09:50 -> 00:09:54]  mines and Aztecs many moons ago.
[00:09:54 -> 00:10:00]  Used ritually to induce a euphoric dreamlike state, which back then, of course, was associated
[00:10:00 -> 00:10:02]  with shamanism and divination.
[00:10:02 -> 00:10:04]  Getting absolutely monged off their ramparts, mate.
[00:10:04 -> 00:10:07]  But could you too achieve a similar emphanogenic experience?
[00:10:07 -> 00:10:10]  Indeed, you could, though that would be most degenerate.
[00:10:10 -> 00:10:14]  And it's that kind of degeneracy that will put you straight into the FEMA camps.
[00:10:14 -> 00:10:18]  But alas, the quantities of LSA found within the seeds are minimal.
[00:10:18 -> 00:10:20]  They are trace amounts.
[00:10:20 -> 00:10:25]  You would have to consume upwards to 100 seeds to feel any significant hallucinogenic
[00:10:25 -> 00:10:26]  effect.
[00:10:26 -> 00:10:27]  So good luck with that.
[00:10:27 -> 00:10:34]  But should you nonetheless choose to do so, then you must be cautious, for you see, LSA,
[00:10:34 -> 00:10:39]  as a precursor to LSD, gives it a status of a Class A controlled substance.
[00:10:39 -> 00:10:42]  That would be a schedule-free substance for the American bros.
[00:10:42 -> 00:10:48]  So you must be cautious, you must be on the lookout for the SWAT team that will rappel
[00:10:48 -> 00:10:50]  down from the trees and kick your fucking head in, son.
[00:10:50 -> 00:10:53]  Oh, you're picking fucking seeds out here, boy, that's a felony!
[00:11:18 -> 00:11:41]  Look at this motherfucker, look at it, observe it, absolutely disgusting, disgusting!
[00:11:41 -> 00:11:43]  What is this abomination of nature?
[00:11:43 -> 00:11:47]  Well, it is known as the wasp spider.
[00:11:47 -> 00:11:49]  Indeed, the wasp spider.
[00:11:49 -> 00:11:53]  Entomologists really don't mess around when it comes to naming things out here.
[00:11:53 -> 00:11:55]  They cut straight to the chase.
[00:11:55 -> 00:12:00]  But yo, if you hate wasps and you hate spiders, then well, you're certainly not going to be
[00:12:00 -> 00:12:03]  very fond of the wasp spider.
[00:12:03 -> 00:12:04]  But fear not, for they are harmless.
[00:12:04 -> 00:12:09]  Well, I mean, they have been known to bite humans and they are venomous, but the bite
[00:12:09 -> 00:12:11]  and the venom are harmless.
[00:12:11 -> 00:12:13]  No worse than a bee sting.
[00:12:13 -> 00:12:18]  But my God, imagine if this motherfucker had wings.
[00:12:18 -> 00:12:19]  My God, fuck that.
[00:12:19 -> 00:12:20]  That would be awful.
[00:12:20 -> 00:12:24]  Oh, see, the world's not such a bad place, is it?
[00:12:24 -> 00:12:25]  It could be much worse.
[00:12:25 -> 00:12:28]  This wasp spider done got himself some dindins.
[00:12:28 -> 00:12:31]  It's looking like a lean cut grasshopper right there.
[00:12:31 -> 00:12:36]  This fills my heart with the greatest of sorrows, because I like grasshoppers.
[00:12:36 -> 00:12:38]  They are most interesting, most majestic.
[00:12:38 -> 00:12:42]  That's naughty, spider, naughty spider!
[00:12:42 -> 00:12:48]  The frilly lilac pom-poms of the calcareous grasslands and meadows, Nautia avensis.
[00:12:48 -> 00:12:50]  An elegant name.
[00:12:50 -> 00:12:52]  Common name, field scabious.
[00:12:52 -> 00:12:53]  Not so elegant.
[00:12:53 -> 00:12:56]  And indeed, the etymology is not particularly pleasant either.
[00:12:56 -> 00:13:02]  For you see, the word scabious is derived from scabies, the seven year itch, the infamously
[00:13:02 -> 00:13:05]  undesirable infectious skin disease.
[00:13:05 -> 00:13:08]  You may be familiar, but hopefully not.
[00:13:08 -> 00:13:10]  Why is this plant named after scabies, you ask?
[00:13:10 -> 00:13:13]  Well, because historically, it helped to cure it.
[00:13:13 -> 00:13:18]  All the sores and skin blisters associated with that ailment, field scabious was used
[00:13:18 -> 00:13:20]  to treat the symptoms.
[00:13:20 -> 00:13:25]  And field scabious was also used to treat burns, blisters and inflamed wounds.
[00:13:25 -> 00:13:27]  All manner of rashes and topical skin ailments.
[00:13:27 -> 00:13:28]  How?
[00:13:28 -> 00:13:30]  Well, quite simply, with a poultice.
[00:13:30 -> 00:13:34]  The application of a crushed, damp Nautia avensis flower head was used as a topical
[00:13:34 -> 00:13:37]  compress to the troubled areas of the skin.
[00:13:37 -> 00:13:38]  And how does it work, you ask?
[00:13:38 -> 00:13:40]  Well, it is an astringent.
[00:13:40 -> 00:13:44]  It will constrict and dehydrate the areas of skin which you apply it to.
[00:13:44 -> 00:13:49]  So wounds will not weep and blisters will not form if you nip them in the bud early
[00:13:49 -> 00:13:52]  enough with a poultice of Nautia avensis.
[00:13:52 -> 00:13:53]  Easy right?
[00:13:53 -> 00:13:54]  How marvellous.
[00:13:54 -> 00:13:57]  A medicinal flower, easily recognisable.
[00:13:57 -> 00:13:58]  One for the notebook.
[00:14:10 -> 00:14:22]  Well, fuck me, it's a field of rapeseed.
[00:14:22 -> 00:14:25]  Oh my god, you watch some rapeseed, you watch some indeed.
[00:14:25 -> 00:14:28]  A plant whose etymology is particularly perplexing.
[00:14:28 -> 00:14:31]  This sea of sulphur is a plant known as rapeseed.
[00:14:31 -> 00:14:36]  Which is not the most inviting of names, that is fairly ominous indeed, but fear not, for
[00:14:36 -> 00:14:42]  the rape part is derived from the Latin rapum, which means turnip, as rapeseed inflorescence
[00:14:42 -> 00:14:44]  is so very similar to turnip inflorescence.
[00:14:44 -> 00:14:45]  Why?
[00:14:45 -> 00:14:46]  Because of reasons.
[00:14:46 -> 00:14:48]  You want to learn about turnips and mustard and rapeseed?
[00:14:48 -> 00:14:52]  Then go subscribe to Farming Aesthetics, that's a new channel coming soon.
[00:14:52 -> 00:14:53]  Not really, that's a lie.
[00:14:53 -> 00:14:58]  But one thing is for certain though, proximity to rapeseed will absolutely rape your sinuses.
[00:14:58 -> 00:15:03]  Your olfactory system gets shot to shit out here by the noxiously suffocating miasmic
[00:15:03 -> 00:15:04]  clouds of pollen.
[00:15:04 -> 00:15:07]  This is where hay fever sufferers go to euthanise themselves.
[00:15:07 -> 00:15:08]  Is rapeseed edible?
[00:15:08 -> 00:15:10]  Well, that's up for debate.
[00:15:10 -> 00:15:14]  Wild rapeseed is high in a substance known as erucic acid, and this isn't a particularly
[00:15:14 -> 00:15:16]  desirable chemical to consume.
[00:15:16 -> 00:15:21]  Considered safe in low doses, but wild rapeseed is not a plant you'd want to engorge yourself
[00:15:21 -> 00:15:22]  upon.
[00:15:22 -> 00:15:27]  However, a small handful of the actual seeds found within the ovary of the plant will provide
[00:15:27 -> 00:15:33]  you with a healthy batch of omega-3, omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids, which will serve
[00:15:33 -> 00:15:34]  you well.
[00:15:34 -> 00:15:36]  Good for the brain, those amigas.
[00:15:36 -> 00:15:42]  Prepare yourself, for I am about to present to you what I believe to be the most interesting
[00:15:42 -> 00:15:46]  plant that I have ever had the pleasure of presenting on an episode of Camp Aesthetics.
[00:15:46 -> 00:15:51]  A plant that proves useful, but not in regards to survivalism or camping.
[00:15:51 -> 00:15:57]  Not in regards to your post-apocalyptic escapist fantasies or your post-fema-camp nomadic lifestyle,
[00:15:57 -> 00:15:58]  no no.
[00:15:58 -> 00:16:00]  But in regards to life itself.
[00:16:00 -> 00:16:06]  So, make yourself a cup of tea, because we're about to bust a little bit of science.
[00:16:06 -> 00:16:09]  This plant is known as Lesser Periwinkle.
[00:16:09 -> 00:16:12]  Its genus and species, vinca minor.
[00:16:12 -> 00:16:17]  An evergreen plant, meaning that its glossy, leathery foliage will be present all year
[00:16:17 -> 00:16:18]  round.
[00:16:18 -> 00:16:24]  Even through the most depraved and woeful of winters, in large colonial blankets, inhabiting
[00:16:24 -> 00:16:27]  the shady, damp regions of the woodland.
[00:16:27 -> 00:16:28]  Are they edible?
[00:16:28 -> 00:16:29]  No.
[00:16:29 -> 00:16:34]  Vinca minor is host to a magnitude of alkaloids, and some of which are known to be toxic to
[00:16:34 -> 00:16:35]  humans.
[00:16:35 -> 00:16:41]  But nonetheless, this is quite the miracle flower, because it does so much work out here,
[00:16:41 -> 00:16:43]  in regards to modern medicine.
[00:16:43 -> 00:16:49]  There's something for everyone, in amongst that bunch of vinca alkaloids, toxic or not.
[00:16:49 -> 00:16:52]  Notably, there is vincristine and vinblistine.
[00:16:52 -> 00:16:57]  These chemicals are used as anti-cancer drugs, in chemotherapy.
[00:16:57 -> 00:17:01]  And these are the alkaloids that make vinca minor consumption quite potently toxic.
[00:17:01 -> 00:17:06]  But of course, that is the nature of chemotherapy, cytotoxicity.
[00:17:06 -> 00:17:11]  So it's a good set of toxins, for certain individuals.
[00:17:11 -> 00:17:16]  And another alkaloid, vincamine, is used in the treatment of dementia, stroke and Alzheimer's
[00:17:16 -> 00:17:17]  disease.
[00:17:17 -> 00:17:22]  It's used to prevent, combat and reverse the degenerative neurological effects and cognitive
[00:17:22 -> 00:17:25]  decline associated with those ailments.
[00:17:25 -> 00:17:29]  Vinclamine does wonders for the brain, particularly damaged brains.
[00:17:29 -> 00:17:35]  But another vinca alkaloid, vinpocetine, is a non-toxic vinca alkaloid.
[00:17:35 -> 00:17:40]  And this is one that we, as healthy individuals, could utilise.
[00:17:40 -> 00:17:45]  Because vinpocetine is a commercially sold nootropic substance.
[00:17:45 -> 00:17:47]  Ah, well then, what does that mean?
[00:17:47 -> 00:17:52]  Well, nootropics are chemicals that enhance cognitive function.
[00:17:52 -> 00:17:59]  They're marketed under labels such as brain steroids, smart drugs, Viagra for the brain,
[00:17:59 -> 00:18:02]  neuro-enhancers, memory enhancers.
[00:18:02 -> 00:18:08]  They are the closest thing we have to NZT-40, in this plane of existence.
[00:18:08 -> 00:18:10]  Vinpocetine is a smart drug.
[00:18:10 -> 00:18:15]  And it works by relaxing and dilating the blood vessels leading to and around the brain.
[00:18:15 -> 00:18:20]  Which therefore increases the amount of blood, oxygen and glucose that can enter your brain.
[00:18:20 -> 00:18:26]  Flooding your brain with an abundance of resources which your brain will work overtime to utilise.
[00:18:26 -> 00:18:34]  And in by doing so, one could expect to experience an improved ability to retain and recall information,
[00:18:34 -> 00:18:40]  a heightened sense of alertness, an enhanced ability to process and analyse information,
[00:18:40 -> 00:18:47]  faster reaction times, clarity of thought and improved focus and concentration.
[00:18:47 -> 00:18:53]  All of the necessary prequisites required to stay focused, stay motivated and get shit done.
[00:18:53 -> 00:18:57]  And this is why Vinpocetine, as an extract from the Lesser Periwinkle plant,
[00:18:57 -> 00:19:01]  as a readily available commercially sold dietary supplement,
[00:19:01 -> 00:19:08]  has earned its honourable place amongst the bedside tables of quite a few university students.
[00:19:08 -> 00:19:10]  Interesting plant, right?
[00:19:10 -> 00:19:13]  Hey man, hey, hey, hey man, come closer, come closer I say!
[00:19:13 -> 00:19:16]  Hey, you wanna know a fun fact?
[00:19:16 -> 00:19:19]  Butterflies smell with their feet.
[00:19:19 -> 00:19:20]  Oh, oh, that's a fun fact.
[00:19:20 -> 00:19:22]  Let me tell you another one.
[00:19:22 -> 00:19:25]  Did you know that a group of butterflies is called a flutter?
[00:19:25 -> 00:19:28]  Like a school of fish, a flutter of butterflies.
[00:19:28 -> 00:19:31]  Watch as the flutter of butterflies flutters by.
[00:19:31 -> 00:19:32]  Oh, that's a real fun fact.
[00:19:32 -> 00:19:34]  Share that with the females for you see.
[00:19:34 -> 00:19:35]  Here's some science for you.
[00:19:35 -> 00:19:38]  Females generally like men.
[00:19:38 -> 00:19:40]  Females generally like butterflies too.
[00:19:40 -> 00:19:46]  So from this we can deduce that females will generally like a man that knows a thing or two about butterflies.
[00:19:46 -> 00:19:47]  You cannot argue with this logic.
[00:19:47 -> 00:19:49]  That is cold hard science.
[00:19:49 -> 00:19:52]  So share that fun fact with your lady friend.
[00:19:52 -> 00:19:56]  And then sit back and observe as she begins to precipitate.
[00:19:56 -> 00:19:59]  Rightio, let's take a little bit of a break from botany.
[00:19:59 -> 00:20:01]  Let's mix it up.
[00:20:01 -> 00:20:02]  Let's get crafty.
[00:20:17 -> 00:20:19]  See that weeping willow tree right there?
[00:20:19 -> 00:20:22]  We're going to take a branch of that weeping willow tree
[00:20:22 -> 00:20:25]  and we're going to miraculously fashion it into a signal whistle.
[00:20:25 -> 00:20:28]  You what, son? Indeed, a search and rescue whistle.
[00:20:28 -> 00:20:30]  And we're not talking about a tenuous little whistle
[00:20:30 -> 00:20:32]  whom siren is that of a teapot boiling over.
[00:20:32 -> 00:20:33]  No, no.
[00:20:33 -> 00:20:39]  We're talking about a signal whistle that can achieve sound levels of upwards to 100 decibels,
[00:20:39 -> 00:20:42]  which is just as loud as commercially sold search and rescue whistles.
[00:20:42 -> 00:20:46]  Just imagine cross woodland communication with your brethren,
[00:20:46 -> 00:20:48]  catcalling your girlfriend,
[00:20:48 -> 00:20:50]  impressing your girlfriend with your handy woodcrafts,
[00:20:50 -> 00:20:52]  signalling for rescue,
[00:20:52 -> 00:20:55]  deafening your friends by blowing it right in their ear.
[00:20:55 -> 00:20:57]  The possibilities are endless.
[00:20:57 -> 00:21:00]  And all you need is a stick of willow and a knife.
[00:21:00 -> 00:21:02]  So let's proceed.
[00:21:02 -> 00:21:05]  To begin, I will annotate the areas of interest.
[00:21:05 -> 00:21:08]  The far end of this stick, nothing goes on here.
[00:21:08 -> 00:21:09]  Everything occurs up this end.
[00:21:10 -> 00:21:12]  This is the working end and this is the cut-off point.
[00:21:12 -> 00:21:17]  This is what will eventually become the mouthpiece of the whistle once all is said and done.
[00:21:17 -> 00:21:21]  So the first order of business is to create the blowhole of the whistle
[00:21:21 -> 00:21:26]  in the form of a small V-shaped notch about an inch or so below the cut-off point.
[00:21:26 -> 00:21:27]  So let's do that.
[00:21:36 -> 00:21:38]  Now that's done.
[00:21:38 -> 00:21:39]  We just need to pull off the bark.
[00:21:39 -> 00:21:43]  So we'll need to separate the whistle's bark from the rest of the stick.
[00:21:43 -> 00:21:47]  So we're going to cut into the bark
[00:21:47 -> 00:21:49]  all the way around the mouthpiece end.
[00:21:49 -> 00:21:50]  Voila!
[00:21:50 -> 00:21:53]  Now that the bark is separated and independent,
[00:21:53 -> 00:21:54]  we just need to pull it off.
[00:21:54 -> 00:21:56]  Easier said than done, however.
[00:21:56 -> 00:21:58]  This is the tricky part,
[00:21:58 -> 00:22:01]  because the outer bark is bound to the wood.
[00:22:01 -> 00:22:03]  The bond is not particularly strong,
[00:22:03 -> 00:22:06]  but it's strong enough to make pulling it off quite difficult.
[00:22:06 -> 00:22:10]  But there is an easy way to dislodge the bark and loosen those bonds.
[00:22:10 -> 00:22:14]  And that way is by blunt force trauma.
[00:22:14 -> 00:22:15]  Makes me erect.
[00:22:15 -> 00:22:19]  So just give it a cheeky bash with the handle of your knife
[00:22:19 -> 00:22:21]  or a similar heavy blunt object.
[00:22:21 -> 00:22:23]  In before penis jokes.
[00:22:23 -> 00:22:25]  And after giving it a good old bash,
[00:22:25 -> 00:22:28]  you should start to see the outer bark come away from the wood.
[00:22:28 -> 00:22:29]  And with any luck,
[00:22:29 -> 00:22:31]  with a twist and a pull,
[00:22:31 -> 00:22:34]  the bark should slide right off.
[00:22:34 -> 00:22:35]  Easy life.
[00:22:35 -> 00:22:38]  And now it's time to create the sound chamber.
[00:22:38 -> 00:22:42]  The sound chamber is just a lengthy extension of this initial notch.
[00:22:42 -> 00:22:44]  And as a general rule of thumb,
[00:22:44 -> 00:22:45]  the larger the chamber,
[00:22:45 -> 00:22:47]  the lower the pitch of the whistle.
[00:22:47 -> 00:22:48]  The smaller the chamber,
[00:22:48 -> 00:22:50]  the higher the pitch.
[00:22:50 -> 00:22:52]  It's a game of pressure.
[00:22:58 -> 00:23:00]  And we are nearly done.
[00:23:00 -> 00:23:02]  But before we slide the bark back on,
[00:23:02 -> 00:23:05]  there's one more order of business we must attend to.
[00:23:05 -> 00:23:08]  We need to create the mouthpiece.
[00:23:08 -> 00:23:11]  So, chop off all the excess branch.
[00:23:11 -> 00:23:14]  And then carve a flat plane into the mouthpiece.
[00:23:14 -> 00:23:17]  No more than a couple millimetres is required.
[00:23:17 -> 00:23:19]  So...
[00:23:19 -> 00:23:23]  we're gonna go ahead and do that.
[00:23:23 -> 00:23:25]  And we are done.
[00:23:25 -> 00:23:26]  Once the bark has been slid back on,
[00:23:26 -> 00:23:29]  we have a completed willow whistle.
[00:23:29 -> 00:23:32]  And as a final touch, I've cut a small curve into the mouthpiece,
[00:23:32 -> 00:23:35]  just so it accommodates my mouth a bit more.
[00:23:35 -> 00:23:37]  Because we value dem-ergonomics out here.
[00:23:37 -> 00:23:40]  But perhaps to gain a more thorough understanding
[00:23:40 -> 00:23:42]  of exactly why we've done what we've done here,
[00:23:42 -> 00:23:45]  is to explain how whistles like this work.
[00:23:45 -> 00:23:48]  The whistling sound is caused by conflicting air currents.
[00:23:48 -> 00:23:50]  As you blow on the whistle,
[00:23:50 -> 00:23:53]  your breath travels down the small channel in the mouthpiece.
[00:23:53 -> 00:23:56]  A small portion of your breath shoots straight out of the blowhole,
[00:23:56 -> 00:24:00]  but a larger portion of your breath travels down into the sound chamber.
[00:24:00 -> 00:24:03]  And when your breath reaches the end of the chamber,
[00:24:03 -> 00:24:05]  it bounces and curves around,
[00:24:05 -> 00:24:08]  and starts travelling backwards as a means of escape.
[00:24:08 -> 00:24:11]  Eventually colliding with the now opposing air current
[00:24:11 -> 00:24:13]  that originates from your breath.
[00:24:13 -> 00:24:15]  And in these moments of conflicting air flows,
[00:24:15 -> 00:24:18]  a whistling sound is created.
[00:24:18 -> 00:24:20]  Why? Because of reasons.
[00:24:20 -> 00:24:21]  And we are done.
[00:24:21 -> 00:24:23]  Would you like to hear a sample?
[00:24:23 -> 00:24:24]  Of course you would.
[00:24:24 -> 00:24:26]  But I imagine it's gonna be pretty loud,
[00:24:26 -> 00:24:28]  so you may want to lower your volume a tad.
[00:24:32 -> 00:24:34]  Allow me to play you the song of my people.
[00:24:38 -> 00:24:41]  But up close and personal isn't really a good indication
[00:24:41 -> 00:24:43]  of just how loud it can be.
[00:24:43 -> 00:24:45]  Let's get some distance between us.
[00:24:54 -> 00:24:55]  Not bad for a stick.
[00:24:55 -> 00:24:58]  And that concludes the making of a willow whistle.
[00:24:58 -> 00:25:00]  Pretty nifty, right?
[00:25:00 -> 00:25:03]  Allow me to play you yet another song of my people.
[00:25:08 -> 00:25:10]  Observe this rock.
[00:25:10 -> 00:25:13]  Look at it, and look at what it resembles.
[00:25:13 -> 00:25:15]  It resembles a satellite image of the surface of Mars,
[00:25:15 -> 00:25:18]  a Martian terrain of barren landscapes,
[00:25:18 -> 00:25:21]  craterous pits and cavernous fissures.
[00:25:21 -> 00:25:25]  Right? Just got a fresh batch of fun facts from the dealer.
[00:25:25 -> 00:25:27]  You want a sample? I'll give you a sample.
[00:25:27 -> 00:25:30]  Grasshoppers are not violent creatures.
[00:25:30 -> 00:25:33]  Under threat, they will instinctively hop or fly away.
[00:25:33 -> 00:25:35]  But under certain circumstances
[00:25:35 -> 00:25:38]  where grasshoppers are incapable of escape
[00:25:38 -> 00:25:41]  and facing certain death at the hands of a predator,
[00:25:41 -> 00:25:44]  then they will employ their last resort.
[00:25:44 -> 00:25:45]  Defensive mechanism.
[00:25:45 -> 00:25:48]  They will spit in your face.
[00:25:48 -> 00:25:49]  That's right.
[00:25:49 -> 00:25:51]  Grasshoppers will bring up digestive fluids
[00:25:51 -> 00:25:53]  from their stomach into their mouth
[00:25:53 -> 00:25:56]  and then forcefully expose it into your face.
[00:25:56 -> 00:25:59]  They will spit a foul, dark brown fluid at you,
[00:25:59 -> 00:26:02]  a fluid that looks a lot like tobacco juice.
[00:26:02 -> 00:26:03]  Oh, that's pretty bad, our son.
[00:26:03 -> 00:26:05]  That's how they throw down.
[00:26:05 -> 00:26:06]  During their valiant last stands,
[00:26:06 -> 00:26:09]  they will shame you by spitting in your face.
[00:26:09 -> 00:26:11]  The ultimate dishonor.
[00:26:11 -> 00:26:14]  A shame that drives many to commit sudoku.
[00:26:14 -> 00:26:15]  Here's an interesting one.
[00:26:15 -> 00:26:17]  A plant known as campion.
[00:26:17 -> 00:26:18]  Look at it.
[00:26:18 -> 00:26:20]  Its anatomy is rather strange.
[00:26:20 -> 00:26:22]  It's ovary.
[00:26:22 -> 00:26:24]  It's seed-bearing pod.
[00:26:24 -> 00:26:25]  It's gigantic.
[00:26:25 -> 00:26:28]  A bulbous, swolling ovary full of eggs.
[00:26:28 -> 00:26:29]  Mm.
[00:26:29 -> 00:26:31]  And so far behind the petals.
[00:26:31 -> 00:26:34]  Flowers typically have their ovary amongst the petals.
[00:26:34 -> 00:26:36]  But campion, no, no.
[00:26:36 -> 00:26:38]  They are special snowflakes.
[00:26:38 -> 00:26:40]  And interestingly enough,
[00:26:40 -> 00:26:42]  this flower is related to ragged robins.
[00:26:42 -> 00:26:44]  They are distant cousins.
[00:26:44 -> 00:26:47]  They reside in amongst the same botanical family,
[00:26:47 -> 00:26:49]  the Caiophyllaceae family.
[00:26:49 -> 00:26:50]  A strange family.
[00:26:51 -> 00:26:53]  Full of plants that possess abominated,
[00:26:53 -> 00:26:55]  inbred, malformed features.
[00:26:55 -> 00:26:57]  Just like the Americans.
[00:26:57 -> 00:26:59]  One big inbred fuck fest.
[00:26:59 -> 00:27:01]  But campion also shares a similar chemistry
[00:27:01 -> 00:27:04]  with their relative ragged robins, saponins.
[00:27:04 -> 00:27:07]  Ah, another source of cleaning products.
[00:27:07 -> 00:27:09]  Ah, there's no excuse for not smelling
[00:27:09 -> 00:27:11]  absolutely fabulous out here.
[00:27:11 -> 00:27:13]  Saponins are everywhere.
[00:27:13 -> 00:27:16]  The abundancy is disgusting.
[00:27:16 -> 00:27:18]  But convenient.
[00:27:18 -> 00:27:19]  Well, well, well.
[00:27:19 -> 00:27:20]  What do we have here then?
[00:27:20 -> 00:27:21]  Is it a fly?
[00:27:21 -> 00:27:23]  Is it a bee?
[00:27:23 -> 00:27:25]  No, it's the bee fly.
[00:27:25 -> 00:27:26]  Indeed.
[00:27:26 -> 00:27:29]  Remember, entomologists really don't screw around out here.
[00:27:29 -> 00:27:32]  It has the fat furry body of a bee,
[00:27:32 -> 00:27:34]  but the long dangly legs of a fly.
[00:27:34 -> 00:27:36]  Oh, that's some inbred right there.
[00:27:36 -> 00:27:37]  This is an American insect.
[00:27:37 -> 00:27:39]  The curl bro of entomology.
[00:27:39 -> 00:27:42]  This is what happens when you skip leg day.
[00:27:42 -> 00:27:43]  The chicken legs out here.
[00:27:43 -> 00:27:46]  Observe as it pollinates.
[00:27:46 -> 00:27:48]  Fertilizes the eggs of flower ovum.
[00:27:48 -> 00:27:50]  Oh, that's most useful.
[00:27:50 -> 00:27:52]  Most productive.
[00:27:52 -> 00:27:54]  Oh my God.
[00:27:54 -> 00:27:56]  We stumbled upon the remnants of a campfire.
[00:27:56 -> 00:27:58]  How interesting.
[00:27:58 -> 00:28:00]  And the owners of such even went through all the trouble
[00:28:00 -> 00:28:02]  of placing rocks around the periphery
[00:28:02 -> 00:28:04]  for a nice little neat fireplace.
[00:28:04 -> 00:28:06]  Oh, that's style points right there.
[00:28:06 -> 00:28:08]  I applaud this.
[00:28:08 -> 00:28:10]  But hold the phone, Jeff.
[00:28:10 -> 00:28:14]  These rocks, they have fractured quite severely.
[00:28:14 -> 00:28:15]  Hmm.
[00:28:15 -> 00:28:17]  This arouses much concern because it would seem
[00:28:17 -> 00:28:20]  as if these rocks have exploded in the fire.
[00:28:20 -> 00:28:21]  Oh dear.
[00:28:21 -> 00:28:23]  And I speculate that these rocks were obtained
[00:28:23 -> 00:28:26]  from the stream that is no more than 10 feet away from here.
[00:28:26 -> 00:28:27]  Wet rocks, boy.
[00:28:27 -> 00:28:29]  That's a schoolboy error.
[00:28:29 -> 00:28:31]  Not criticizing, no, just generally quite concerned.
[00:28:31 -> 00:28:32]  Hmm.
[00:28:32 -> 00:28:33]  Two options.
[00:28:33 -> 00:28:38]  Option one, that these rocks exploded gloriously
[00:28:38 -> 00:28:41]  and violently, which then perforated the happy campers
[00:28:41 -> 00:28:43]  with a shower of silica shrapnel
[00:28:43 -> 00:28:46]  as flames furiously flicked fractured flakes of flint
[00:28:46 -> 00:28:49]  flying, exploding projectile rock fragments to the eyes.
[00:28:49 -> 00:28:52]  My God, that is a tale of unparalleled tragedy.
[00:28:52 -> 00:28:55]  Alternatively, option two,
[00:28:55 -> 00:28:58]  these happy campers just had one ginormous
[00:28:58 -> 00:29:00]  fat off napping session.
[00:29:00 -> 00:29:01]  Hmm.
[00:29:01 -> 00:29:02]  Who knows?
[00:29:02 -> 00:29:03]  Such mystery.
[00:29:03 -> 00:29:04]  Oh my God.
[00:29:04 -> 00:29:06]  What do we have here then?
[00:29:06 -> 00:29:07]  A crab apple?
[00:29:07 -> 00:29:09]  No, no, don't be silly, Cletus.
[00:29:09 -> 00:29:11]  This is a walnut.
[00:29:11 -> 00:29:12]  An English walnut.
[00:29:12 -> 00:29:14]  Nuts that grow on trees.
[00:29:14 -> 00:29:15]  Oh yeah, prove it.
[00:29:15 -> 00:29:16]  Boom.
[00:29:16 -> 00:29:19]  Observe that signature wrinkly shell
[00:29:19 -> 00:29:22]  of an unripe walnut that is not yet ready for consumption.
[00:29:22 -> 00:29:23]  But if you are fortuitous enough,
[00:29:23 -> 00:29:25]  then you may find ripe walnuts scattered
[00:29:25 -> 00:29:27]  amongst the leaf litter.
[00:29:27 -> 00:29:28]  Like so.
[00:29:28 -> 00:29:30]  Ripe walnuts will lack the green husk
[00:29:30 -> 00:29:32]  as part of the fruition process involves
[00:29:32 -> 00:29:35]  the natural degradation and shedding of the husk
[00:29:35 -> 00:29:38]  to leave behind the exposed brown shell.
[00:29:38 -> 00:29:40]  And inside said brown shell
[00:29:40 -> 00:29:43]  is an ambrosial walnut of the gods.
[00:29:43 -> 00:29:45]  But these are a fan favorite amongst the squirrels.
[00:29:45 -> 00:29:47]  They nab them up real quick.
[00:29:47 -> 00:29:49]  So hard life tough potatoes,
[00:29:49 -> 00:29:50]  you ain't getting shit out here.
[00:29:50 -> 00:29:52]  But let me tell you about these nuts though.
[00:29:52 -> 00:29:53]  A fun fact.
[00:29:53 -> 00:29:55]  If you pick and scrape the green husk
[00:29:55 -> 00:29:57]  off the walnut with your bare hands,
[00:29:57 -> 00:30:01]  then it will absolutely stain your fingers and hands.
[00:30:01 -> 00:30:03]  Brownie orange.
[00:30:03 -> 00:30:05]  And it is a tremendously strong dye.
[00:30:05 -> 00:30:08]  It is an absolute nightmare to remove.
[00:30:08 -> 00:30:11]  It stains your hands for days.
[00:30:11 -> 00:30:13]  I mean literally for several days.
[00:30:13 -> 00:30:14]  It's terribly inconvenient.
[00:30:14 -> 00:30:16]  Even Ragged Robin's opponent's soap
[00:30:16 -> 00:30:18]  will have trouble removing walnut dye.
[00:30:18 -> 00:30:20]  Walnut dye is indeed a thing.
[00:30:20 -> 00:30:22]  Historically, it was used to dye hair,
[00:30:22 -> 00:30:26]  stain wooden furniture, and color clothing.
[00:30:26 -> 00:30:29]  So you certainly do not want to get that on your hands.
[00:30:29 -> 00:30:31]  Trust me daddy when I say,
[00:30:31 -> 00:30:32]  it will not come off easy.
[00:30:32 -> 00:30:35]  The day's end draws near.
[00:30:35 -> 00:30:37]  Darkness will soon envelop.
[00:30:37 -> 00:30:39]  And we haven't even found any fungi today.
[00:30:39 -> 00:30:41]  Oh, that's just unacceptable.
[00:30:41 -> 00:30:43]  So we must search for mother nature's
[00:30:43 -> 00:30:47]  most majestic mushrooms to show some love
[00:30:47 -> 00:30:49]  to all branches of biology.
[00:30:49 -> 00:30:53]  But we must be cautious of spindle shank.
[00:30:53 -> 00:30:55]  Ever so cautious.
[00:30:55 -> 00:30:58]  For you see, he lurks in the shadows.
[00:30:58 -> 00:31:00]  Hmm, let us procure.
[00:31:00 -> 00:31:02]  Let us begin our diligent search.
[00:31:02 -> 00:31:06]  Ah ha, a fungus.
[00:31:06 -> 00:31:07]  A rather peculiar fungus.
[00:31:07 -> 00:31:09]  A fungus unlike any other
[00:31:09 -> 00:31:12]  has ever been shown in an episode of Campus Fetics before.
[00:31:12 -> 00:31:15]  A fungus with an incredibly unique anatomy.
[00:31:15 -> 00:31:17]  So let's talk about this special snowflake.
[00:31:17 -> 00:31:19]  No, let's talk about this group of fungi in general.
[00:31:19 -> 00:31:22]  The Pisizaceae family of fungi.
[00:31:22 -> 00:31:23]  Let's slow that down.
[00:31:23 -> 00:31:26]  Pisizaceae family of fungi.
[00:31:26 -> 00:31:29]  Otherwise known as the cup fungi
[00:31:29 -> 00:31:33]  for reasons that should be immediately perceivable.
[00:31:33 -> 00:31:37]  Cup fungi are so irregular in their anatomy
[00:31:37 -> 00:31:39]  and in their production and dispersion of spores.
[00:31:39 -> 00:31:43]  They do the complete opposite of what normal mushrooms do.
[00:31:43 -> 00:31:46]  For you see, typical mushrooms such as the ajarics,
[00:31:46 -> 00:31:48]  the bellets and the polypores,
[00:31:48 -> 00:31:50]  their spores are produced on the exterior
[00:31:50 -> 00:31:51]  which then drop off the mushroom
[00:31:51 -> 00:31:53]  and gravity does the rest of the work.
[00:31:53 -> 00:31:55]  But with cup fungi,
[00:31:55 -> 00:31:58]  their spores are produced on the interior
[00:31:58 -> 00:32:01]  within the confines of the interior wall of the cup.
[00:32:01 -> 00:32:04]  And these spores are kept in what you could call
[00:32:04 -> 00:32:06]  little pressurized tubes.
[00:32:06 -> 00:32:08]  And upon the maturity of the spores
[00:32:08 -> 00:32:09]  or an environmental trigger
[00:32:09 -> 00:32:12]  such as wind, humidity, rain or percussion,
[00:32:12 -> 00:32:16]  these pressurized tubes like little delicate glass vials
[00:32:16 -> 00:32:18]  housing the spores will break.
[00:32:18 -> 00:32:20]  And thus the pressure is released
[00:32:20 -> 00:32:24]  and the spores will be forcefully ejected out of the tube,
[00:32:24 -> 00:32:28]  out of the cup and into the air like a spore gun.
[00:32:28 -> 00:32:30]  Yo, that's some crazy shit.
[00:32:30 -> 00:32:31]  A spore cannon.
[00:32:31 -> 00:32:34]  And hey, if you get really close to a cup fungi like this
[00:32:34 -> 00:32:37]  and blow on it really hard with your breath,
[00:32:37 -> 00:32:39]  then it will break all of the pressurized tubes
[00:32:39 -> 00:32:41]  which will then shoot all of the spores
[00:32:41 -> 00:32:43]  right into your face.
[00:32:43 -> 00:32:45]  How strange.
[00:32:45 -> 00:32:46]  That is most peculiar.
[00:32:46 -> 00:32:47]  And it makes you wonder,
[00:32:47 -> 00:32:52]  is this spore gun method the best method of spore dispersal
[00:32:52 -> 00:32:55]  as a means of ensuring the survival of the species?
[00:32:55 -> 00:32:56]  That's debatable.
[00:32:56 -> 00:32:59]  But nonetheless, many moons ago,
[00:32:59 -> 00:33:01]  a genetic mutation occurred
[00:33:01 -> 00:33:03]  that brought about this particular anatomy
[00:33:03 -> 00:33:05]  and spore gun methodology.
[00:33:05 -> 00:33:06]  And the fungi that were in possession
[00:33:06 -> 00:33:08]  of these genetic mutations
[00:33:08 -> 00:33:12]  were still nonetheless still able to successfully reproduce.
[00:33:12 -> 00:33:15]  So here they are still, to this day,
[00:33:15 -> 00:33:19]  perched upon the riverbanks amongst the Lesser Salandai.
[00:33:19 -> 00:33:20]  Ah!
[00:33:20 -> 00:33:21]  Ah!
[00:33:21 -> 00:33:21]  Ah!
[00:33:21 -> 00:33:23]  Ah, it's been no time to get.
[00:33:23 -> 00:33:26]  A majestic bumblebee traversing the labyrinth
[00:33:26 -> 00:33:28]  of forget-me-nots.
[00:33:28 -> 00:33:30]  That's most dignified, most regal.
[00:33:30 -> 00:33:32]  Are you unfamiliar with forget-me-nots?
[00:33:32 -> 00:33:34]  Allow me to introduce you.
[00:33:34 -> 00:33:37]  These sky-blue, star-studded,
[00:33:37 -> 00:33:39]  celestial clusters of inflorescence
[00:33:39 -> 00:33:40]  are known as forget-me-nots.
[00:33:40 -> 00:33:44]  And they're easily identifiable by their petite size
[00:33:44 -> 00:33:47]  and the little star pressed into the center of the flower.
[00:33:47 -> 00:33:48]  Oh, that's real nice.
[00:33:48 -> 00:33:50]  But can you eat them?
[00:33:50 -> 00:33:51]  Yes, indeed you can.
[00:33:51 -> 00:33:53]  But only the petals are edible.
[00:33:53 -> 00:33:55]  The rest of the plant is undesirable.
[00:33:55 -> 00:33:59]  But a pinch of petals to garnish your bowl of slop,
[00:33:59 -> 00:34:01]  that's style points right there.
[00:34:01 -> 00:34:03]  That's gourmet garnish.
[00:34:03 -> 00:34:04]  That's cheeky nibbles.
[00:34:04 -> 00:34:07]  But forget-me-nots is a curious name.
[00:34:07 -> 00:34:10]  Surely there's a grand tale to be told of this.
[00:34:10 -> 00:34:12]  And indeed there is.
[00:34:12 -> 00:34:15]  The origin of the name forget-me-nots.
[00:34:15 -> 00:34:19]  Legend has it that once upon a time in ye old England,
[00:34:19 -> 00:34:21]  a brave knight and a fair maiden
[00:34:21 -> 00:34:24]  escaped the confines of their castle village
[00:34:24 -> 00:34:26]  to go for a leisurely stroll
[00:34:26 -> 00:34:29]  through the enchanted forests of the borderlands.
[00:34:29 -> 00:34:31]  And as they strolled along the riverbanks
[00:34:31 -> 00:34:34]  sharing tales of folly and jest,
[00:34:34 -> 00:34:38]  the fair maiden spotted down by the water's edge
[00:34:38 -> 00:34:41]  a beautiful cluster of sky blue,
[00:34:41 -> 00:34:43]  petite star-studded flowers.
[00:34:43 -> 00:34:46]  Ah, she requested that the brave knight
[00:34:46 -> 00:34:49]  climb down the bank and pick her a posy of them
[00:34:49 -> 00:34:51]  for they are most beautiful.
[00:34:51 -> 00:34:53]  And of course the brave knight agreed
[00:34:53 -> 00:34:55]  for it is his solemn hope and wish
[00:34:55 -> 00:34:58]  to win the affection and approval of the fair maiden.
[00:34:58 -> 00:35:02]  So the brave knight tactically repelled down the banks,
[00:35:02 -> 00:35:04]  kneeled down and picked her a posy
[00:35:04 -> 00:35:06]  of these star-spangled flowers.
[00:35:06 -> 00:35:11]  But as he stood back up, his foot slipped on the wet banks
[00:35:11 -> 00:35:14]  which sent the knight tumbling and plunging
[00:35:14 -> 00:35:16]  into the depths of the rushing river.
[00:35:16 -> 00:35:18]  And of course the fair maiden initially
[00:35:18 -> 00:35:20]  found this quite comical.
[00:35:20 -> 00:35:23]  Oh, that silly knight, always goofing around.
[00:35:23 -> 00:35:25]  But no, this was truly perilous.
[00:35:25 -> 00:35:28]  For you see, the brave knight was drowning
[00:35:28 -> 00:35:30]  under the weight of his own armor.
[00:35:30 -> 00:35:32]  Oh, he thrashed and he splashed,
[00:35:32 -> 00:35:34]  but he could not keep afloat.
[00:35:34 -> 00:35:36]  He was being dragged to the depths
[00:35:36 -> 00:35:38]  to succumb to a watery death.
[00:35:38 -> 00:35:42]  The brave knight tried all that he could to swim to shore,
[00:35:42 -> 00:35:44]  but it was futile.
[00:35:44 -> 00:35:47]  He could not fight the current in his heavy suit of armor.
[00:35:47 -> 00:35:50]  My God, he is fucking brown bread, mate.
[00:35:50 -> 00:35:53]  Powerless with a seemingly sealed fate,
[00:35:53 -> 00:35:55]  the brave knight could do nothing else
[00:35:55 -> 00:35:58]  but make peace with his God and come to terms
[00:35:58 -> 00:36:03]  with his rather unfortunate and untimely watery demise.
[00:36:03 -> 00:36:06]  And while the horrified fair maiden bystands on the shore,
[00:36:06 -> 00:36:09]  offering what little verbal encouragement she can,
[00:36:09 -> 00:36:12]  the brave knight sinks lower and lower
[00:36:12 -> 00:36:16]  under the swirling torrents and calamity of currents.
[00:36:16 -> 00:36:20]  But in the throes of his peril, he made one last gesture.
[00:36:20 -> 00:36:23]  He raised his hand above the water,
[00:36:23 -> 00:36:25]  still clenching onto that posy of flowers.
[00:36:25 -> 00:36:27]  He threw the bouquet of flowers
[00:36:27 -> 00:36:30]  towards his maiden on the shore.
[00:36:30 -> 00:36:33]  And with his last dying breath, he shouted,
[00:36:33 -> 00:36:36]  forget me not, my love.
[00:36:36 -> 00:36:37]  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.
[00:36:39 -> 00:36:41]  He was then dragged under.
[00:36:41 -> 00:36:43]  The knight was dead.
[00:36:43 -> 00:36:45]  And that is the story of how these flowers
[00:36:45 -> 00:36:47]  came to be known as forget-me-nots.
[00:36:47 -> 00:36:47]  The end.
[00:36:48 -> 00:36:49]  And so ends the day.
[00:36:49 -> 00:36:51]  Good game, right?
[00:36:51 -> 00:36:54]  Now, it's time for the shallows.
[00:36:54 -> 00:36:56]  For all of the Leos that represented
[00:36:56 -> 00:36:59]  in the comment section of Compass Fetix 14,
[00:36:59 -> 00:37:01]  today, I bask you in glory.
[00:37:01 -> 00:37:04]  Bestoweth upon you an honorable mention,
[00:37:04 -> 00:37:06]  which I shall present to you today.
[00:37:06 -> 00:37:08]  I am the knight of the Leos,
[00:37:08 -> 00:37:11]  and I shall be your knight of the Leos.
[00:37:11 -> 00:37:13]  I am the knight of the Leos,
[00:37:13 -> 00:37:15]  and I shall be your knight of the Leos.
[00:37:16 -> 00:37:17]  An honorable mention,
[00:37:17 -> 00:37:20]  which I shall provide in the form of a credit roll.
[00:37:20 -> 00:37:21]  Why?
[00:37:21 -> 00:37:26]  Because, well, I have over 180 shout-outs to give.
[00:37:27 -> 00:37:29]  And if each shout-out takes a minimum
[00:37:29 -> 00:37:30]  of 2.5 seconds to say,
[00:37:30 -> 00:37:35]  then it will take approximately 450 seconds
[00:37:35 -> 00:37:36]  to get through them all.
[00:37:36 -> 00:37:41]  Divide that by 60, and it will take 7.5 minutes
[00:37:42 -> 00:37:44]  to get through all of these shout-outs.
[00:37:45 -> 00:37:46]  Do we have time to sit through
[00:37:46 -> 00:37:48]  7.5 minutes of shout-outs?
[00:37:48 -> 00:37:50]  No, we do not.
