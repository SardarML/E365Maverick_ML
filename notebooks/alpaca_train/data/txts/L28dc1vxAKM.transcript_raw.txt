 Protein is vital to your muscles,  but do you ever wonder how much you actually need?  And are all protein sources created equal?  Well, watch now to learn more  about what protein can do for you.  Hi, I'm sports dietician Tara Collingwood.  Let's talk protein today.  So protein is absolutely vital to our diet  for so many reasons.  It helps us to build and repair our cells and muscles,  but did you know that it also helps with satiety?  So satiety is how long food stays with you.  You're staying power.  A balanced diet is gonna include  a variety of protein sources,  and dairy is a high-quality, complete protein  containing all of the essential amino acids.  The protein in dairy, called whey and casein,  helps you to feel full longer  and provides energy to fuel your day.  Diets higher in dairy protein  can help you build and retain that muscle,  but also you get adequate calcium  to help maintain healthy bones,  manage your weight, and control your hunger.  So exercise can actually cause muscle breakdown,  and high-quality protein like milk, cheese, yogurt,  eggs, and lean meats can actually rebuild  and repair those muscles.  Whey protein is a great choice after a workout  as your body can digest it quickly,  and it contains the highest content of leucine,  which is an amino acid that's been showed  to build and repair muscles after a workout.  So whey protein powders are another great option  and can be added to smoothies made with milk or yogurt.  We need protein all day long,  so it's best to spread it out at your meals  and your snacks throughout the day.  In fact, some experts suggest that you benefit  from eating 20 to 30 grams of protein at each meal  in order to get all that protein in for the day.  Aim for protein at breakfast, like milk in your cereal,  yogurt, or some eggs, and focus on a good source of protein  at lunch and dinner as well.
