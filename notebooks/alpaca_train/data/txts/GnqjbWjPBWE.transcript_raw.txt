 An open internet fuels content, media, marketplace of ideas for everyone, for all of humankind.  So let me unpack what that means.  There's a tug of war happening right now between the open internet and massive destinations,  sometimes called walled gardens.  When a particular destination gets really large, like a Google or a Facebook, they have  the luxury of isolating their content so that you have to buy it their way, and you log  onto their platform, you use their data, and then they give you very high level reports  back.  And they do this to protect the data that they have, and because it's the best way  for them to maintain control.  And as long as you have something close to a monopoly, whether it's in search or in social,  you have the luxury of doing that.  But in contrast, there is this entire open internet where one piece of content can be  compared to another piece of content, so that then marketers can make data-driven decisions  about what they want to buy.  So in this tug of war, it's not just about efficacy for marketers.  It's also about what sort of internet, what sort of marketplace of ideas do we as a planet,  as humankind, do we want?  Do we want one where there's a few destinations that control lots of it?  Do we want one where journalism lives at their whim?  Or do we want one where the marketplace of ideas competes?  It is inevitable that the open internet will win, because there is just way too much great  content and way too many great ideas that eventually the walls have to come down.  But that will all start because marketers will prefer to advertise on the open internet,  and because content owners will join the open internet, because it's a better way for them  to monetize, and it's a better marketplace.  Marketplace of ideas, marketplace of media, a marketplace of content.
