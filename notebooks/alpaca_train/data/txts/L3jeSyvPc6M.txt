[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  Alright, now let's check out the next organelle which is, it has a lot of names
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:10]  but I like to call it Golgi Body because it's really simple but it can be also
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:15]  known as Golgi Apparatus or it can be known as the Golgi Complex. And basically
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:20]  what it is, it's over here, and basically what it is, it's just a stack of
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:25]  flattened sacks, okay? And there can be more than one in an animal cell but
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:28]  generally I think you'll just come across one during your A-level and we're
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:32]  gonna keep it simple for our sake. And it's constantly being formed at one end
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:37]  of the ER and it's broken down again on the other to form Golgi vesicles. So
[00:00:37 -> 00:00:44]  basically its process is, it collects processes and sorts molecules ready for
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:51]  transportation. And an example would be, as I've written here, addition of sugar
[00:00:51 -> 00:00:59]  to proteins. So for example, to form a glycoprotein or it can be the removal
[00:00:59 -> 00:01:04]  of amino acids to form a functional protein or for example in plants, it can
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:10]  be used, the enzymes convert the sugars to a cell wall so a functional, you know,
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:15]  a structural component which then will be used to build the cell wall of the
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:22]  plant. So let's go ahead and take an actual look at the process which has
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:30]  four steps. Well, it's made here, written down here in four steps. So basically in
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:37]  the first step, the proteins are made by the ribosomes in the rough endoplasmic
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:41]  reticulum and then are pinched off into vesicles. So it's made in the rough
[00:01:41 -> 00:01:46]  endoplasmic reticulum and then it's made into vesicles. So here it is, a transport
[00:01:46 -> 00:01:51]  vesicle. Alright? And then the second step, the vesicles containing the proteins
[00:01:51 -> 00:01:55]  fuse into the Golgi body where the proteins are modified. So the purpose of
[00:01:55 -> 00:02:00]  the Golgi body happens. And then the third step, the vesicles containing the
[00:02:00 -> 00:02:05]  modified proteins break away from the Golgi body. So here. And then, so it's also
[00:02:05 -> 00:02:11]  known as the secretory vesicle. And then the fourth step is simply exocytosis. So
[00:02:11 -> 00:02:16]  the vesicle fuses with the cell surface membrane, releasing the proteins to the
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:21]  outside cell. So it's just a simple four-step process and I recommend you
[00:02:21 -> 00:02:33]  remembering this. Next, let's check out lysosomes, which are basically spherical
[00:02:33 -> 00:02:38]  sacs with no internal structure. And they contain hydrolytic or digestive enzymes,
[00:02:38 -> 00:02:43]  which are responsible for the breakdown of old and unwanted organelles. And why
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:48]  is it contained in these sacs? It's because you don't want the entire cell
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:52]  to be digested. So it's contained in these protective sacs and they're only
[00:02:52 -> 00:02:56]  used where they need to be. By the way, this is an animal cell. I just wanted an
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:00]  enlarged or zoomed version of a lysosome because over here you can see the
[00:03:00 -> 00:03:05]  lysosome is only a circle. And it's a single membrane and it's around 0.1 to
[00:03:05 -> 00:03:12]  0.5 micrometers. An example of where these would be used is in mammary glands.
[00:03:12 -> 00:03:17]  After lactation, they digest away the lactating cells or lactating the
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:23]  organelles which are responsible for lactation, I mean. And or another example
[00:03:23 -> 00:03:26]  would be a more common example would be in white blood cells where these
[00:03:26 -> 00:03:36]  lysosomes are used to digest the bacteria. And now let's move on to the
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:40]  next organelle, which is known as the mitochondrion. Now as soon as you see
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:45]  mitochondrion, you should realize that this is the powerhouse of the cell. This
[00:03:45 -> 00:03:49]  is where all the energy is made and is released and it's what keeps your body
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:53]  going. Now here in the diagram, you can see that the mitochondrion is this
[00:03:53 -> 00:03:57]  specific structure and the function of the mitochondrion, so if you want the
[00:03:57 -> 00:04:02]  mark, is responsible for aerobic respiration. It provides energy for the
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:07]  cell. Energy is released from energy-rich molecules through a series of steps. Now
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:12]  these series of steps you will learn, for example, glycolysis etc etc in A2 and you
[00:04:12 -> 00:04:16]  don't need to know that but you need to know that it is a series of steps. The
[00:04:16 -> 00:04:20]  secondary function is synthesis of lipids but this is the main function. Now
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:26]  a rough estimate as to the size would be around one micrometer in diameter and
[00:04:26 -> 00:04:31]  muscle cells, so cells which make up your muscle muscle tissue will have more of
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:35]  these mitochondrion because they require more energy. Now let's take a look at the
[00:04:35 -> 00:04:40]  mitochondrion structure because it's very well suited for its purpose. Now
[00:04:40 -> 00:04:46]  just like the nucleus, the mitochondrion is a double membrane organelle. So first
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:50]  let's look at the inner membrane. The inner membrane is more selective, okay? So
[00:04:50 -> 00:04:57]  it controls more strictly what enters and leaves the mitochondrion. The inner
[00:04:57 -> 00:05:02]  membrane makes these folds and these folds are labeled as here as cristae and
[00:05:02 -> 00:05:07]  now you may ask why are there these folds? Well it's pretty simple really and
[00:05:07 -> 00:05:11]  I think it's a year 7 thing or something like that. It basically it
[00:05:11 -> 00:05:17]  increases surface area and therefore it makes the reactions which happens, more
[00:05:17 -> 00:05:21]  reactions to happen, therefore it's more efficient. So whenever you say like why
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:24]  is there cristae, you just say it's because it increases surface area,
[00:05:24 -> 00:05:28]  therefore it increases efficiency because it allows more reactions to take
[00:05:28 -> 00:05:35]  place, okay? And then there is the outer membrane which is more permeable, however
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:41]  it does not allow H2O soluble molecules to go in, therefore it has these things
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:47]  called transport membrane proteins. The specific ones are called aquaporins and
[00:05:47 -> 00:05:52]  it forms aqueous channels to allow the H2O soluble molecules to pass through
[00:05:52 -> 00:05:57]  into the intermembrane space. Now I keep mentioning intermembrane space, well
[00:05:57 -> 00:06:01]  maybe not keep mentioning, but the intermembrane space is the space between
[00:06:01 -> 00:06:05]  the inner and the outer membrane and it is a very important space which you will
[00:06:05 -> 00:06:09]  need to know in A2, but you but you still need to know this for AS, so you just
[00:06:09 -> 00:06:13]  need to know that that's the space between the inner and the outer membrane.
[00:06:13 -> 00:06:18]  Now cristae, as I mentioned, are these finger like projections and then there's
[00:06:18 -> 00:06:23]  the matrix which is the interior solution. Now there are the other things
[00:06:23 -> 00:06:27]  called granules, ribosomes, and ATP synthase. Now this thing is an enzyme
[00:06:27 -> 00:06:32]  which is needed for the respiration reaction, so you know as I said it's very
[00:06:32 -> 00:06:36]  well suited, so therefore it contains these enzymes within its matrix and then
[00:06:36 -> 00:06:41]  it has its own DNA and it has its own ribosomes and it proposes a new theory
[00:06:41 -> 00:06:46]  which we will take a look at in just a second. Now just before we move on to the
[00:06:46 -> 00:06:51]  theory, just a small piece of information and I guess a summary.
[00:06:51 -> 00:06:57]  Mitochondria produces ATP. ATP stands for adenosine triphosphate and is
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:02]  importantly known as a universal energy carrier and as I mentioned earlier the
[00:07:02 -> 00:07:06]  folding of the cristae increases surface area and therefore increases efficiency.
[00:07:06 -> 00:07:12]  And here is just a diagram I guess of a summary of the respiration reaction, so
[00:07:12 -> 00:07:16]  the series of steps, but you don't need to worry about that at this level. So
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:24]  let's go ahead and check out the theory. Now I keep mentioning this theory, so
[00:07:24 -> 00:07:32]  let's actually take a look at what this theory is. This is known as the endosymbiont
[00:07:32 -> 00:07:37]  theory. Now endo meaning inside and symbiont actually is a long definition.
[00:07:37 -> 00:07:44]  It is an organism which lives inside another organism for mutual benefits. Now
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:50]  in the 1960s, the scientists actually discovered that the mitochondrion was
[00:07:50 -> 00:07:54]  not an organelle, it was actually an independent bacteria. Now why do they
[00:07:54 -> 00:07:59]  believe this? It's because it has these things such as DNA, ribosomes and
[00:07:59 -> 00:08:04]  granules and these things were used to sustain these organelles. I mean
[00:08:04 -> 00:08:10]  these tiny things I guess are mini organelles for this mitochondrion is
[00:08:10 -> 00:08:15]  what helped it sustain independently before it was adopted and integrated
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:23]  into our human cells. Now the ribosome is smaller than the our ribosome, so the
[00:08:23 -> 00:08:29]  ribosome size inside the mitochondrion is 70s whereas the ribosomes which are
[00:08:29 -> 00:08:36]  lying free in the animal cell and in the RER are size 80s. So this is what
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:41]  led scientists to believe that the mitochondrion were actually independent
[00:08:41 -> 00:08:45]  before they were colonized by us.
