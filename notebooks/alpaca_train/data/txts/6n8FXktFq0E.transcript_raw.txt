 Hey there guys, most judicial review questions are problem type scenarios, so that'll be the main focus of this lecture  But hopefully we'll cover enough stuff so that if you do get an essay question  You'll also be able to answer that and I think judicial review is sort of split into two main sections  Firstly bringing case for judicial review and then secondly the actual grounds for judicial review  So we'll cover both in this lecture  Right, let's get started  So a question on judicial review normally centers around a person who has had a decision go against them in some way and they'll  Be looking to challenge that decision through the courts by way of judicial review  Now before we even get to that stage we have to make sure that the person is able to bring a case and there are  Four things that we have to look at  In this in this first main section that I talked about in the introduction, so we'll go through each of these in turn  So the first point is that has to be brought in relation to secondary legislation and the important thing is here that  primary legislation or acts of Parliament cannot be challenged and this comes back to the constitutional idea of  parliamentary sovereignty  Parliament should be able to make any laws that it wants to and those acts of Parliament cannot be challenged in the courts  Instead we're going to be looking at the challenging of secondary legislation  So statutory instruments in particular regulations, orders and most commonly in scenario type questions  decisions of public bodies  So that brings us on to our next point. What is a public body?  Well, there's a couple of key cases here in Ex parte Aga Khan  Aga Khan tried to bring a case against the Jockey Club and the courts turned around and said well  Actually, the Jockey Club is a relationship between private individuals  Operating out of the public sphere and so Aga Khan was not able to bring a case for judicial review  The court said that instead those types of decisions should be challenged through private law rather than public law  It doesn't necessarily bring us closer to a definition for a public body though  But Datafin is a really good case and definitely one to use in any question on judicial review  Because it provides us with a broad definition for what a public body is. Now in a lot of cases  This might be obvious because it'll be a council or a school or some obvious part of the public sector  But Datafin looks more closely at the functions that a body is performing  So if the functions of a body are mainly public in nature  Then it can be considered a public body. If they're mainly private in nature  Then it isn't and those decisions by that body as in Aga Khan cannot be challenged  So when you're analysing this in a problem question or within an essay  Do make sure that you sort of consider those types of factors. What function is the body actually performing?  Locustandai comes down to the idea of standing  Do you have the standing to bring a case?  And the main question here that the court asks is does the person have a sufficient interest in the case?  And there's a really good quote there from Lord Scarman in the Fleet Street Casuals case  And they said that it's important that we don't have a judicial review system  That basically allows any random person off the street to challenge any decision that they just don't really like for whatever reason  So the person has to have an actual interest in the case the decision or the regulation  Has to affect them in some way  And the courts have expanded this out a little bit and we see that with the Greenpeace case at the bottom of the screen  in this case  Greenpeace who are obviously a widely respected  environmental pressure group  Tried to bring a case and the inspectorate of pollution said well  They shouldn't be allowed to because they're not local residents. They're not actually  Directly affected by the pollution in a particular area because they're a global pressure group. So they're not  directly affected and the court said well  actually Greenpeace because of their  Availability of funds because of the research that they've carried out in this area  They're in a much better position than the local residents to bring a case  And so the courts in this case did allow Greenpeace to bring a case for judicial review. So that  Slightly expanded definition is definitely one to bear in mind  When considering locus standi and the sufficient interest test  Now the time limit is very simple it's taken from the civil procedure rules in particular rule 54.5  Says that a case must not be brought later than three months after the grounds to make the claim first arose  So as we said it normally involves a decision going against a person and that decision being made  Starts the clock and therefore a case has to be brought within three months of that decision being made  Now there's a few minor exceptions that you could look into if you wanted to  But to be honest the courts do tend to strictly apply this rule  And just to prevent any sort of miscarriages of justice or a case being delayed for such a long period of time  So generally in a problem question do apply that as a three-month strict rule that is applied by the courts  Now before we move on to the grounds of judicial review  Do you want to talk quickly about ousted clauses and these are basically attempts to exclude judicial review  so in the most famous case of Anisminich and FCC  The law in question said that decisions shall not be called into question in any court of law  And the important thing here was that the court said well  We're not really challenging the final decision as such what the point of judicial review is is to look at the grounds for that  Decision in the first place and the way that decision came about not really looking at the final decision as such  And so they got round the ouster clause in that particular case  In theory an ouster clause could work  But it would have to be worded very specifically to get rid of judicial review  Basically, the courts don't like ouster clauses because judicial review is a really important part of public law. It allows  members of the public to challenge decisions that  Do fall under one of the three grounds that we'll look at next  So the three grounds for review are irrationality  illegality and procedural impropriety  So we'll go through each of those in turn  The first of them is irrationality and law students tend to fall into a bit of a trap here because they think oh  Well, that decision doesn't seem very sensible. Therefore. I think it can be challenged on grounds for of irrationality  But irrationality actually is a much more stricter test than  rather not a decision not being very sensible and we can see that through Lord Green's quote in the  famous Wensbury case from 1948  A decision has to be so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it  And we move on in the GCHEQ case. Lord Diplock says that it has to basically be completely outrageous in its defiance of logic  So you can see here that irrationality rather than it being a sort of  casual test that will take out any decision that  Is a little bit kooky or a little bit strange it has to be basically completely off the walls  and so in the Wensbury case and the council famously was a given the power to  restrict cinema access on  a sunday  And the council said oh that means that we can prevent 15 year olds going to the cinema  and the courts turned around and said what the hell are you talking about the  Rule had absolutely nothing to do with age limits or 15 year olds  It was to do with sunday opening times and so you can see there that the decision was just so completely  batshit crazy for want of a better word and that the courts were able to challenge it on grounds of irrationality  So i've split these main cases up into  Levels of reviewability if you like, so at the top we have non-justiciable issues such as the GCHQ case  And this involved the government secret services and the courts didn't really want to get involved in security matters  And so that wasn't reviewable  In a sort of similar way policy areas are also non-reviewable  Even though a government minister's decision might seem not very sensible to some  People on the political spectrum. It's not an area for the courts to get involved with they're not involved with politics  They should be removed from that discussion  So you could maybe think of something like the recent decision by Jeremy Hunt involving contracts for junior doctors  And some people would say that that is an irrational decision  But really it comes down to politics. So it's the policy of the conservative government to  Enforce that contract on junior doctors and so the courts would not get involved with challenging that decision generally  In the middle we have the reasonable test that we've already talked about from Wensbury  and moving towards  More reviewable cases or areas where a judicial review is more likely to succeed  We have areas of human rights. So ex parte smith from 1995  Involved homosexuals in the army  And that case actually wasn't successful. You'll notice it was before the human rights act came in  But then in Daly, which is the 2001 case  And they went to the european court of human rights  Challenged the decision against homosexuals in the army was successful in europe  And therefore were able to bring a case for judicial review and we'll look at human rights a little bit later on  And we'll see how  That offers a more generous way to approach judicial review and makes reviews more likely to succeed  That idea of proportionality as well is something that's also taken from european union case law  And it's a bit more of a fair way of  Taking a balance  When you're looking at a decision so looking at the rational aspects and the irrational aspects of it  And weighing the decision up overall  Illegality is a possibly also another misnomer and another area where law students tend to fall down  Because the decision isn't really illegal  It's more ultra vires, which literally translates as outside of the power  So it involves a a minister or a public body of some sort acting outside of their power  Of some sort acting outside of their allocated powers and we see that in the early case of attorney general and fulham corporation from  1921  And the rule in this case allowed local bodies to set up  Laundrettes for the poor so that they could do their washing for free  And instead the fulham corporation in this case set up a commercial laundry where they charged members of the public  And they said well, this isn't really the point of the law  You weren't given the power to open a commercial laundry  And so you have acted outside of your powers in this particular case  And illegality can also  Take into account irrelevant considerations  So in Port Talbot borough council ex parte jones and the local council  prioritized giving a council house to a local councillor on the basis that she needed it because  She was the councillor for that area and therefore she ought to live in that area  but this didn't really take into account the  Considerations that the council would normally apply such as the need for a council house. Are there children involved things like that?  so the fact that  Jones or whoever it was the local councillor  Was a member of the local council  Was completely irrelevant when coming to the decision and so irrelevant considerations do also play a part in whether a decision is  ultra-virus  Unauthorized delegation of powers as well is relevant. So national dock labour board  What happened was that the national dock labour board were given the power to set up a disciplinary committee  And they delegated that power to each individual local dock  And they basically said well you were given the power to set up a disciplinary board you weren't given the power to delegate  That particular power even further down the chain  And so unauthorized delegation of powers can also  Come under ultra-virus illegality  Finally we have procedural impropriety  This is a lot more simple and just means that the correct procedure wasn't followed  So in Aylesbury mushrooms case the relevant department failed to consult the mushroom growers association  And so they said that you haven't actually fulfilled  the correct procedure for taking a decision and therefore  the  Decision doesn't affect the Aylesbury mushrooms growers association  And that can be challenged on judicial review grounds  Procedural impropriety is also sort of broadened out a little bit  So it includes bias as well and we have the test there from Lord Lane  Would a person conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased?  So again, we don't have to prove that there was actually bias in the case. We just have to  Deal with the suggestion that there might have been bias  And it comes back to the famous quote from the Sussex justices case that justice must not only be done  It must also be seen to be done as well  And so that's important to remember  Fair hearing, another old case for this  Cooper and Wandsworth board of works and this sets up that there should be a fair hearing  Whenever any sort of decision is made and this might include things like the right to an appeal  And the right for both sides to be heard the right for someone to present their own arguments  And this might not apply in all of the cases, but generally speaking a person should be allowed to make representations  When a decision is actually affecting them  Moving on in procedural impropriety, we also have legitimate expectations as well. So in the Liverpool taxi case the Liverpool taxi  Association were given assurances by Liverpool corporation  that  A decision would not be taken without consulting the taxi drivers first and then Liverpool corporation made the decision anyway  And they said well, this wasn't really fair  because the Liverpool taxi drivers  Should have been consulted because they had been given assurances and it had raised a legitimate expectation  That the drivers would be consulted before a decision was actually made  And generally also a reason should be given for a decision. So we have ex parte duty for that  Particular ground so generally speaking reasons should be given for any particular decision  The institute of dental surgery are put in there because if the decision is very straightforward and really just academic in nature  So a foregone conclusion  Then in that particular case, it might not always be necessary for reasons to be given  but  I definitely think that this is something worth considering in a problem question if reasons aren't given for a decision  That's not really very fair and to go back a slide  It comes back to that idea for a fair hearing as well when you have a fair hearing  You should also have reasons given for a particular decision at the end of that fair hearing  So  Before we come to the end of this and move on to  remedies, I want to talk a little bit about human rights because  I think this is maybe an area that you could gain some extra marks on in an exam question or in a coursework  It's something that students tend to forget about  Because it is still a relatively new phenomenon within the area of judicial review  And a key section of the human rights like 1998 here is section 6.1  That says it's unlawful for a public authority to act in a way, which is incompatible with a convention right?  And so it's something to bear in mind, especially thinking back to procedural impropriety  We can think about the right to a fair hearing and that links very closely to article 6 of the european convention on human rights  and so if you don't think that there's been a fair hearing or  Reasons haven't been given for a decision  Then definitely mention article 6 because it is an important consideration  And as we can see from section 6.1  It's something that the courts ought to take into consideration that public bodies  Should be taking into account people's convention rights  Obviously, it can also  Extend beyond article 6 so we can maybe think about article 10 as well  So when you present you should be given freedom of expression your right to present a case before a decision is made  Also things like article 8 might even come up as well  So if a decision is made to kick someone out of their home  That comes back to the right to family life and private life and the right to you know, have a  some sort of secure private  Individual space that can't be invaded by a local council, for example  So lots of things that you might want to consider and definitely keep that human rights knowledge  At the back of your brain when answering any question on judicial review  So very finally we'll look at remedies and i've listed all of the remedies there most of them are relatively straightforward  Students often forget to put this in at the end of a judicial review question  But if you think that a person is likely to succeed for judicial review  You've got to think about well, what does that person want? Do they want the decision to be quashed?  So it's um completely sort of taken out now  That's it is probably an obvious one, but other orders might be appropriate in different circumstances  So a prohibiting order prohibiting a public authority from doing something say  Cutting down a section of forest or wildlife  A mandatory order so making a public body do something  A declaration as to the situation that the legal parties are in just to avoid any future confusion  Injunctions are also important when going through a case  So before a final decision is made that can sometimes take years  Should an injunction be granted to prevent the public authority doing something within that time?  So an interim injunction, so  an injunction against a public body until the final decision is actually taken or a permanent injunction to  Permanently stop a public body from doing something  And they can be both positive and negative. So forcing a public body to do something for a positive injunction  Or stopping a public body from doing something for a negative injunction  And every law student's favorite remedy that they always put into questions  And answers is damages  So if a person's been negatively affected by a decision in an economic fashion  Is there an argument that they should possibly also receive damages?  Now don't focus too much on damages because obviously the point of judicial review is to get a decision  Overturned in some sort of way with one of the remedies above but if that if there has been an economic consequence  Then definitely also consider damages as part of your answer  When structuring your answer in a judicial review question  Do you make sure in the first section to cover all four of the reasons?  On the basis that a person can bring a case. So does it concern secondary legislation?  Is it against a public body?  Does the applicant have locus standi and are they bringing the case within the three month time limit?  When you move on to the second section  Do have a careful think about it. Not all questions will involve all three grounds for judicial review  So some might only concern procedural impropriety  Some might concern illegality and irrationality  So it's really important that you do have a careful think and don't just go for a blanket response that covers all three grounds  Thank you very much for watching  If you enjoyed the video then do leave a like subscribe for more videos  And if you do have any questions or comments then leave them below  A lot of people have got in touch requesting other videos on a number of topics  So i'll try and get around to those when I can  If you have suggestions for other videos that you'd like me to cover in a lecture  Then do comment below and i'll try and get to them whenever I can  Thanks very much for watching.
