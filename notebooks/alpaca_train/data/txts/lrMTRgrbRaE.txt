[00:00:00 -> 00:00:13]  I'm Dr Brenda Parker and I'm the admissions tutor for the Department of Biochemical Engineering.
[00:00:13 -> 00:00:19]  So biochemical engineering is a degree that enables you to undertake an interdisciplinary
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:24]  training gaining a knowledge of not only the fundamentals of engineering science but also
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:30]  biochemistry and molecular biology. One of the questions we get asked quite a lot is
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:33]  what is the difference between chemical and biochemical engineering? Let's start with
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:40]  the similarities. So in terms of the fundamentals you will still learn the same thermodynamics,
[00:00:40 -> 00:00:46]  fluid flow, the kind of mechanical processes that you need to be an engineer. Where biochemical
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:51]  engineering differs is that we also teach molecular biology and biochemistry in a really
[00:00:51 -> 00:00:56]  integrated way. The difference is that we bring in a biological process into engineering
[00:00:56 -> 00:01:02]  and this opens up many possibilities for stem cell work, synthetic biology, vaccines and
[00:01:02 -> 00:01:06]  pharmaceuticals. The way that we structure the course we draw all of this information
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:11]  together until your third year where you'll do a big design project where you'll look
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:17]  at how we manufacture a pharmaceutical compound for example and you'll take that process from
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:22]  the very inception discovery stage right through clinical trials and to manufacturing.
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:27]  One of the key features of our degree is that we try to offer our undergraduates as much
[00:01:27 -> 00:01:32]  practical and hands on experience as possible. To facilitate that we have a pilot facility
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:39]  downstairs with fermentation up to about 150 litres and all of the different unit operations
[00:01:39 -> 00:01:44]  so you will see from beginning to end how a biological manufacturing process works and
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:49]  you'll get hands on time actually seeing the equipment in operation and understanding
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:56]  how it works in the lab. To complement this we also have enormous links with industry,
[00:01:56 -> 00:02:01]  pharmaceutical industry and other bioprocess industries and during the course of your degree
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:06]  you will have a site visit where you'll be able to see how all of the concepts that you're
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:10]  learning in your undergraduate degree are applied to real life. The kinds of students
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:15]  we're looking for are people who really want to be leaders in their field, who've got a
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:20]  passion for the life sciences but really want to see that applied into meaningful products
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:25]  and solutions. So perhaps you're studying A level biology but you enjoy physics and mathematics
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:30]  and you don't want to give that side of your studies up, biochemical engineering will be
[00:02:30 -> 00:02:36]  a great way for you to integrate all of those facets of your A level so far. Or perhaps
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:42]  you were considering a chemical engineering route but you are attracted by an emerging
[00:02:42 -> 00:02:46]  industry such as biotechnology, you don't need to have biology to study biochemical
[00:02:46 -> 00:02:51]  engineering, we will teach all of the concepts that you need to know here. Once they finish
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:56]  our students go on to a number of different career paths, this might be within the pharmaceutical
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:02]  industry looking at process development or research and development. Many of our graduates
[00:03:02 -> 00:03:06]  go on to further study and PhDs which reflects the fact that our field is quite new and
[00:03:06 -> 00:03:11]  emerging and as a department we're quite research intensive so many people feel inspired
[00:03:11 -> 00:03:17]  to go on to study a PhD. Finally because obviously you're an engineer, you're numerate, articulate,
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:22]  you're in demand from a number of other industries such as the financial sector. Because we have
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:28]  a really good insight into the pharmaceutical industry a number of people go on also to
[00:03:28 -> 00:03:34]  look at consultancy roles where an insight and an understanding of how drugs are manufactured
[00:03:34 -> 00:03:39]  is really important. So if you're the kind of student who's motivated by the challenges
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:46]  of making biofuels, new vaccines, engineering stem cells, you're exactly the kind of person
[00:03:46 -> 00:03:50]  that we want to hear from and if you've any questions please drop us a line and we'd be
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:52]  more than happy to see you at some of our open days.
