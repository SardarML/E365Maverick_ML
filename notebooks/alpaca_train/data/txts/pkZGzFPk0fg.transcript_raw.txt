 ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ  ùÖòùÖ•ùÖÆ  other elements now let us talk about organic compounds and their uses as we  all know that carbon compounds exist in many different forms it is because of  correct it is because of its valence electrons now there are many examples of  organic compounds which can be seen or can be observed in our everyday life so  you're not organic compounds that contains carbon and hydrogen and this  often comes with oxygen nitrogen sulfur phosphorus and other elements to name a  few you know if I'm gonna commit non-carbon compounds organic compounds  is we have of course your paper your nail polish your candle you know how  fabrics or tela you have also soap and of course you gasoline now let's proceed  to the first example of organic compounds which is known as hydrocarbons  now I don't know by your hydrocarbons now from the word itself hydrocarbons  these are molecules that you know bone and carbon and hydrogen so usually  human hydrocarbons are found in many of us else organic molecules to include you  know molecules and of course you mamalian adipose cells so there are four  families that will move also hydrocarbons so this includes the  alkanes the alkenes alkynes and the last one are aromatic compounds now what are  the key features or paano mo ba malalaman yung pagkakai ba between the  unang-unang yung alkanes ay binubuo ng single bands or three wherein yung alkanes  naman they are made from carbon to carbon double band and yung sa alkynes naman  ito ay binubuo or dinudugtong ng isang triple band and of course yung  aromatic compounds naman this contains a ring of alternating single and double  bands so as you can see here there are the examples and of course the class  which is saturated unsaturated unsaturated and of course your aromatic  compounds are also unsaturated now let's proceed to the first example of  hydrocarbons known as alkanes now it is quite easy to identify that it is an  example of alkanes because as you can see the carbon and hydrogen atoms are  connected by a single band so as you can see single band lang yung nagkokonek  between hydrogen and carbon so when that happens it is known as alkanes here are  other examples of alkanes known as pentane hexane heptane and octane now  let's proceed with alkenes now kong kanina yung alkanes is made up of  single band yung alkenes naman it is made up of double band so yung nagkokonek  between hydrogen and carbon as you can see are double bands another example of  hydrocarbons is known as alkynes kong kanina made up of single band din yung  alkynes naman made up of double band yung alkynes naman they are made up of  triple band so maday lang ma differentiate between the three as you  could clearly see that carbon is connected with hydrogen with triple band  yung carbon to carbon connection is made up of triple band let's proceed to the  functional groups which is the fourth example of hydrocarbons now yung  functional groups ay binubuo ng dalawa so let's start with the first one which  is known as the alcohol hydroxyl group now you already know or it is quite easy  na malaman that is composed of alcohol hydroxyl group because from the word  itself these are the compounds within carbon and hydrogen which contains  alcohols so these are bonded to a carbon atom of an alkyl or a substituted  alkyl group now of course we already know kung ano ba yung gamit na mga  alcohols so this serves as many purpose but one of the most popular use is it is  used for disinfecting now let us proceed to the last example of the functional  groups which is known as the acetone and formalin also known as the carbonyl  group now pag sinabing carbonyl group they are chemically organic functional  group composed of carbon atom which are double bonded to an oxygen atom now  examples of carbonyl group includes the acetone formaldehyde ketones and aldehydes  now the common uses especially on acetone is it is because or it is used  as cosmetics for pharmaceuticals for paints and other uses such as solvent  and for laboratory uses in the case of formaldehyde this is used for  embalming and other preservation purposes this time let us test your  knowledge with regards to the uses of organic compounds so are you ready first  off try to identify the uses of the following organic compounds so you are  just going to check the whether the following or the given organic compounds  are used for antiseptic cosmetics medicine or beverage or fuel food or  cleaner so the given organic compounds are facial cream antibiotics down to  kerosene now you may pause the video while answering and press play so that  you would know the answer so good luck so here are the correct responses as we  all know facial cream as are used for cosmetics antibiotics for medicine LPG  is of course used for fuel vinegar can be used as an antiseptic and food as  well betadine for antiseptic vegetable oil for food penicillin for medicine  baking soda can be used for antiseptic food and of course cleaner is still  alcohol is also used for antiseptic is also used for beverage and fuel on the  other hand the man young kerosene is used as fuel and of course for cleaner  now let's move on to the next activity this time you are also given again a  list of organic compounds and you are going to identify its base whether it  is solid liquid or gas try to identify its order whether it is it has a strong  order or a weak order and try to answer yes if it is flammable if it is viscous  and if it is volatile so good luck so here are the correct responses did you  get it all correct if so congratulations now for the last quiz you  are only going to identify whether the following examples are alkane alkene or  alkyne so you are going to write a if it is an alkene e for alkene and y for  alkyne so are you ready so it will not allow your correct responses so Tom  I'm a lot of congratulations you may review again the video so that you will  get a perfect score so that's it for today's video I hope you have learned  and have fun don't forget to click like subscribe and ring the bell for you to  be updated for my next videos so I'm
