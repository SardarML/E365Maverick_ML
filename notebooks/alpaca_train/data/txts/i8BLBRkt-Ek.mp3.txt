[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  Fancy learning some interesting facts about that body of yours?
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:10]  Then stick around because you're about to seriously up your trivial pursuit game.
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:14]  Here are seven less commonly known facts about the body's internal organs.
[00:00:14 -> 00:00:15]  So let's get to it.
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:21]  First up on our list, the acid in your stomach is strong, enough to dissolve razor blades.
[00:00:21 -> 00:00:25]  Yes, we're looking at the stomach's evil side here.
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:28]  Gastric acid is a type of acid found in the stomach.
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:33]  Makes up most of the gastric acid which enables us to break down the protein molecules in
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:34]  our food.
[00:00:34 -> 00:00:37]  Hydrochloric acid is not to be messed up with, however.
[00:00:37 -> 00:00:42]  As well as playing a role in our digestion, it also functions as a strong corrosive which
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:46]  enables it to eat through many types of metal.
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:49]  Needless to say, please don't try this at home.
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:51]  Now on to our second fact.
[00:00:51 -> 00:00:55]  The human body contains an estimated 60,000 miles of blood vessels.
[00:00:55 -> 00:00:57]  Well, let's put this into perspective.
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:01]  The distance around Earth is around 25,000 miles.
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:06]  This means that if your blood vessels were laid end to end, it could stretch around the
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:11]  Earth twice with some of them making it onto the third lap.
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:15]  Next up, the adrenal glands change size throughout life.
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:20]  Now, we all know that we shrink in height as we grow older but did you know that shrinkage
[00:01:20 -> 00:01:22]  is happening inside your body too?
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:27]  The adrenal glands are two small glands that sit on top of your kidneys.
[00:01:27 -> 00:01:34]  They contain two distinct layers, the outer adrenal cortex and the inner adrenal medulla.
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:37]  Between them, these structures produce important hormones.
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:41]  On top of that, the adrenal glands gradually shrink as you get older.
[00:01:41 -> 00:01:46]  At the seventh month of fetal development, the adrenal glands are a similar size to the
[00:01:46 -> 00:01:47]  kidneys.
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:52]  At the time of birth, right up until old age, the glands begin to shrink, eventually becoming
[00:01:52 -> 00:01:55]  so small that they can hardly be seen.
[00:01:55 -> 00:01:58]  Our fourth fact may surprise you.
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:02]  Scientists have counted over 500 different liver functions.
[00:02:02 -> 00:02:07]  The liver's best known function may be as your alcohol detoxification center but its
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:09]  functions stretch far beyond this.
[00:02:09 -> 00:02:16]  In fact, the liver is one of the body's hardest working, largest and busiest organs.
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:21]  Some perhaps lesser known functions of the liver include bioproduction, decomposition
[00:02:21 -> 00:02:28]  of red blood cells, storage of excess iron, detoxification of harmful substances and plasma
[00:02:28 -> 00:02:29]  protein production.
[00:02:29 -> 00:02:31]  And now for fact number five.
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:35]  You get a new stomach lining every three to four days.
[00:02:35 -> 00:02:40]  The stomach contains a layer of epithelial tissue full of mucosal cells.
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:45]  This is known as a mucosal epithelium layer or the gastric mucosa.
[00:02:45 -> 00:02:50]  The mucosal cells produce mucus to protect themselves from the harsh hydrochloric acid
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:51]  content in the stomach.
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:57]  However, these cells undergo continuous damage and have an average lifespan of three to four
[00:02:57 -> 00:02:58]  days.
[00:02:58 -> 00:03:03]  If the rate of destruction to the mucosa exceeds the rate at which it can be replaced, the
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:08]  acidic environment within the stomach can destroy the underlying tissues of the stomach
[00:03:08 -> 00:03:09]  wall.
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:12]  And this, everyone, is how peptic ulcers form.
[00:03:12 -> 00:03:13]  Ouch!
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:18]  And now for the next fact, the sixth one, where your left lung is longer but smaller
[00:03:18 -> 00:03:19]  than your right lung.
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:24]  If you had to sketch the picture of the lungs, would you draw two lungs of the same size
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:29]  while the left and right lungs have few small but significant differences beginning with
[00:03:29 -> 00:03:30]  their size?
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:35]  Although it is longer, the left lung is actually slightly smaller than the right lung.
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:40]  This is because the human heart is tilted slightly to the left side of the body causing
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:44]  it to push it up against the left lung and crowd it out.
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:48]  The heart fits into a little alcove known as the cardiac notch.
[00:03:48 -> 00:03:54]  Luckily, the left lung likes to snuggle and it doesn't mind the cramped living conditions.
[00:03:54 -> 00:03:58]  And now, a slightly gruesome seventh and last fact to round things off.
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:02]  The human heart creates enough pressure to squirt blood thirty feet.
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:07]  If you have your blood pressure checked, you will notice two different readings â€“ diastolic
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:11]  blood pressure and systolic blood pressure.
[00:04:11 -> 00:04:15]  Diastolic blood pressure shows your blood pressure when your heart is at rest in between
[00:04:15 -> 00:04:21]  heartbeats whereas systolic blood pressure shows your blood pressure when your heart
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:24]  is actively pumping blood around your body.
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:29]  In order to quickly and efficiently pump blood through your body, a lot of pressure is required
[00:04:29 -> 00:04:32]  enough to squirt blood a distance of thirty feet.
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:36]  Well, it's a little wonder you can feel your heartbeat so easily.
