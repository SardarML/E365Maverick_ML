[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  Note-taking apps are getting better and better these days and there are two that are leading,
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:12]  that's no surprise, OneNote and Notion. So I'm going to compare both of these note-taking apps
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:20]  so you'll be able to figure out what aspects you prioritize and choose which one is best for you.
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:26]  So stay tuned! Now my name is Anna and I make videos about personal project management,
[00:00:26 -> 00:00:32]  digital planning, and productivity so I'd like to welcome you. Now let's get started. First of all
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:38]  let's focus on the main differences between them. Notion focuses on databases like functioning
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:47]  tables, gallery, timeline, board view, and so on. Tasks can be moved across databases and you can
[00:00:47 -> 00:00:54]  create subtasks within those tasks. So basically it's focused more on data collection and great
[00:00:54 -> 00:01:01]  organization within your notes. Whereas with OneNote it's focused more on traditional note-
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:08]  taking except of course on a digital level. Whereas with OneNote it is focused more on
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:15]  traditional note-taking on a digital level of course. It has the pen slash stylus feature
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:23]  where you can also draw and write over written text and images which is a huge thing for people
[00:01:23 -> 00:01:31]  who prefer that kind of flexibility. It also has fonts and an infinite amount of horizontal as well
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:37]  as vertical space to write on. So that's the gist of it. So first of all let's start with Notion.
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:45]  So the pros with Notion are databases which is so beneficial what they're known for. You can
[00:01:46 -> 00:01:55]  link subpages and create subpages within pages. It has a handy sidebar on the mobile app. It has
[00:01:55 -> 00:02:01]  more structure which can be considered a pro or a con depending on what kind of person you are.
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:09]  To-dos can be dragged and dropped into databases and it has great spreadsheet functionality when
[00:02:09 -> 00:02:16]  it comes to a note-taking app. Now the cons however are there's no offline access. So if
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:22]  you're a person who doesn't have data on their phone and you want to access your notes when
[00:02:22 -> 00:02:29]  you're offline this will be a problem. You can't draw with a stylus. Also the fonts they're very
[00:02:29 -> 00:02:33]  limited. So if you're a person who likes to customize your fonts a lot I'm sorry but it's
[00:02:33 -> 00:02:40]  very limited. Everything is basically a database. You can't just add a simple plain text table. Also
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:48]  when it comes to the ability of searching for text within a page that is not an option either.
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:53]  Now when it comes to OneNote. So first of all the pros. I have to mention this because this is the
[00:02:53 -> 00:03:00]  way I actually found out about OneNote was that they have a free drawing option. If you're a
[00:03:00 -> 00:03:07]  stylus user or you have a tablet and you like to draw graphs and basically have a more traditional
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:16]  way of writing then this is a huge plus. Now they have lots of fonts as well and they have
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:21]  offline access. When it comes to their membership it's just completely free. It also supports
[00:03:21 -> 00:03:28]  handwriting recognition if you're into that and you use that kind of feature. There is also a
[00:03:28 -> 00:03:35]  password protection option for your sectors of your notebooks. As well as the ability to have
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:42]  text written everywhere and anywhere and how the page is infinite vertically as well as horizontally.
[00:03:42 -> 00:03:50]  Now when it comes to the cons. First of all the OneNote app lacks a sidebar. However from my
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:58]  personal experience comparing the OneNote app to the Notion app I prefer the OneNote app more.
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:05]  It also has no databases because that's not the focus of this app and unlike Notion it does not
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:14]  have any integrations because Notion has a lot of options to integrate with other apps whereas
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:22]  OneNote not at all. And when it comes to the table option it is very very very basic and yeah if you
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:28]  prefer more of a structure OneNote is definitely more messy looking I'd say. At the end of the day
[00:04:28 -> 00:04:34]  these two apps are very different from each other with different priorities so it depends on what
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:41]  your preferences are. So in summary I'd say that Notion is for someone who prefers more structure
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:50]  and more data collection and organization and maybe like a mini stepping stone towards getting
[00:04:50 -> 00:04:56]  more used to I would say project management apps because it does feel like a project management app
[00:04:56 -> 00:05:00]  and a note-taking app got together and made Notion. That's what it feels like to me. Whereas
[00:05:00 -> 00:05:10]  with OneNote it's more for a person who loves creative freedom and the option to customize a lot
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:16]  and are more traditional when it comes to their note-taking. For example a stylus or they're just
[00:05:16 -> 00:05:23]  trying to go a more digital route and they were a big note-taker when using physical notebooks.
[00:05:23 -> 00:05:29]  I hope this video made your decision a little easier. Let me preface by saying that both of
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:35]  these apps are great for planning and organizing your life. I have playlists for both planning in
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:41]  OneNote and planning in Notion if you'd like more tips on how to use either of the apps. Which one
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:47]  do you prefer OneNote or Notion and why? I'd love to get your opinions. If this video was helpful to
[00:05:47 -> 00:05:53]  you in any way please give it a like and subscribe for more content like this. I hope you have a
[00:05:53 -> 00:06:00]  wonderful day and I will see you next time. Ciao!
