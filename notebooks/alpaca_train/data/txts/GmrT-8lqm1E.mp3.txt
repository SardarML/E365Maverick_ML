[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  Good day students! Welcome back to MaestroingTekie Youtube Channel!
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:10]  Be glad because we are now in the Week 6 of Grade 9 Science Quarter 2 Lesson.
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:17]  This week's topic is all about Organic Compounds. Check out our Learning Objectives.
[00:00:17 -> 00:00:21]  At the end of this video lesson, you will be able to
[00:00:21 -> 00:00:26]  Identify and differentiate organic and inorganic compounds.
[00:00:26 -> 00:00:31]  Recognize the general classes and uses of organic compounds.
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:34]  And give the importance of organic compounds.
[00:00:34 -> 00:00:38]  So, what are you waiting for? Keep on watching!
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:51]  Let us have a very short activity.
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:57]  MaestroingTekie bought some items from a grocery store.
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:03]  Please help her to sort all the organic items and put it inside the basket.
[00:01:03 -> 00:01:06]  Which of the following are organic?
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:08]  We have
[00:01:09 -> 00:01:12]  Carrots. That's right.
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:14]  We also have
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:16]  Eggs.
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:18]  What else?
[00:01:19 -> 00:01:22]  Bananas. That is right.
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:25]  Corns.
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:29]  And we have fresh milk.
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:32]  That is right, class. You did great.
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:39]  In agriculture, we describe organic foods that are raised under specific conditions
[00:01:39 -> 00:01:45]  such as no antibiotics or no pesticides and fertilizers were used.
[00:01:45 -> 00:01:53]  In chemistry, the term organic describes chemical compounds that contain carbon and other elements
[00:01:53 -> 00:01:59]  such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorus.
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:08]  If we are going to recall, when two or more elements are combined together, it is called compounds.
[00:02:08 -> 00:02:12]  Compounds can be classified into two main groups.
[00:02:12 -> 00:02:22]  Organic compounds that contain carbon and usually bonded to hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus.
[00:02:22 -> 00:02:30]  And the second one is the inorganic compounds while most of it do not contain carbon atom in them.
[00:02:30 -> 00:02:34]  Let us take a look at the examples of organic compounds.
[00:02:34 -> 00:02:39]  We have glucose or sugar that we use in our food.
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:45]  Alcohol that we use specially nowadays in the midst of pandemic.
[00:02:45 -> 00:02:48]  Let's make it a habit to sanitize our hands.
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:53]  And soap to wash our hands to prevent viruses in entering our body.
[00:02:53 -> 00:02:56]  All of these contain carbon.
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:00]  On the other hand, we have inorganic compounds.
[00:03:00 -> 00:03:04]  Examples, water or H2O.
[00:03:04 -> 00:03:10]  Our bodies are composed of mostly water and it is necessary for us to survive.
[00:03:10 -> 00:03:18]  However, water is an example of inorganic compounds because it does not contain both carbon and hydrogen.
[00:03:18 -> 00:03:21]  And it was not formed by a living organism.
[00:03:21 -> 00:03:28]  Next example is table salt or sodium chloride that we usually see in our kitchen.
[00:03:28 -> 00:03:31]  Another one is carbon dioxide.
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:41]  Even though it has a carbon atom, it is considered inorganic compound because it does not contain both carbon and hydrogen.
[00:03:41 -> 00:03:51]  A while ago, we knew that organic compounds are called organic because they are associated with living organisms.
[00:03:51 -> 00:04:01]  These molecules form the basis for life and are studied in great detail in the chemistry disciplines of organic chemistry and biochemistry.
[00:04:01 -> 00:04:12]  Most of the foodstuffs that we consume everyday such as sugar, fats, starch, vinegar, and etc. are basically organic compounds.
[00:04:12 -> 00:04:22]  Even though the organic compounds have been known to man since prehistoric times, their study practically began from the 18th century.
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:29]  The term organic compound was coined by Jans Jacob Berzelius in the year 1807.
[00:04:33 -> 00:04:40]  There are four main types or classes of organic compounds found in all living organisms.
[00:04:40 -> 00:04:48]  These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.
[00:04:48 -> 00:04:55]  In addition, there are other organic compounds that may be found in or produced by some organisms.
[00:04:55 -> 00:05:00]  All organic compounds contain carbon, usually bonded to hydrogen.
[00:05:00 -> 00:05:07]  Let's take a closer look at the key types of organic compounds and see examples of these important molecules.
[00:05:07 -> 00:05:10]  Let us explore more about these compounds.
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:16]  Let us start with the most familiar one which is carbohydrates.
[00:05:16 -> 00:05:24]  Carbohydrates are organic compounds made up of elements such as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
[00:05:24 -> 00:05:35]  One example of carbohydrates is glucose or blood sugar and its chemical formula is C6H12O6.
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:42]  As you can see, it only has carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
[00:05:42 -> 00:05:52]  Another thing that you can notice, if you will look at the chemical formula, the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 12 is to 6.
[00:05:52 -> 00:06:02]  Simplifying it, the ratio of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms in carbohydrate molecules is 2 is to 1.
[00:06:02 -> 00:06:07]  Now, let us have the uses of carbohydrates in organisms.
[00:06:07 -> 00:06:14]  Carbohydrates is used as the main or primary energy source, especially in humans.
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:17]  Also, it can make up cell structures.
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:22]  In addition, they are also used as stored energy in plants.
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:30]  From lots of vegetables that we eat, we are actually eating their stored energy in the form of starch like potatoes and grains.
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:35]  Carbohydrates are classified according to how many subunits they contain.
[00:06:35 -> 00:06:38]  Simple carbohydrates are called sugar.
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:43]  A sugar made of one unit is called monosaccharide.
[00:06:43 -> 00:06:49]  Our example a while ago which is glucose or blood sugar is a monosaccharide.
[00:06:49 -> 00:06:50]  Another one is fructose.
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:52]  Have you heard of it before?
[00:06:52 -> 00:06:55]  It is from fruits.
[00:06:55 -> 00:07:01]  Double the monosaccharide, we have disaccharide where two units are joined together.
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:04]  Examples are maltose and sucrose.
[00:07:04 -> 00:07:09]  Lastly, we have polysaccharide.
[00:07:09 -> 00:07:13]  From the word itself, poly, it means two or more.
[00:07:13 -> 00:07:18]  Examples are starch that is the stored energy in plants.
[00:07:18 -> 00:07:28]  Glycogen is a human or animal's reserve stored in our liver and muscles and cellulose that makes up cell wall in plants.
[00:07:28 -> 00:07:31]  That is all for carbohydrates.
[00:07:31 -> 00:07:34]  Next is lipids.
[00:07:34 -> 00:07:43]  Lipids are also made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen just like carbohydrates.
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:51]  Their difference is when you look at the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen, it is greater than 2 is to 1.
[00:07:51 -> 00:08:03]  The uses of lipids include storing energy and acting as structural components of cell membranes that helps it become flexible and fluid-like.
[00:08:03 -> 00:08:08]  Also, it serves as signal molecules to help cells communicate with each other.
[00:08:08 -> 00:08:17]  And another one is the coating on the lips which is called cuticle that makes them waterproof and protects them from elements.
[00:08:17 -> 00:08:22]  The three major groups of lipids are triglycerides.
[00:08:22 -> 00:08:27]  It includes fats, oil, and wax.
[00:08:27 -> 00:08:32]  Second is steroids and phospholipids.
[00:08:32 -> 00:08:36]  Let's take a quick look at fatty acids.
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:41]  Fatty acids can be either saturated or unsaturated.
[00:08:41 -> 00:08:48]  A fatty acid that has a single band only is called saturated fatty acid.
[00:08:48 -> 00:08:56]  Unsaturated fatty acids has one or more double bonds as shown in your screen right now.
[00:08:56 -> 00:09:05]  In most human health situations, the consumption of unsaturated fats is preferred to the consumption of saturated fats.
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:11]  Saturated fats are solid at room temperature and are bad for you.
[00:09:11 -> 00:09:18]  While unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are better for you.
[00:09:18 -> 00:09:25]  Now, let us proceed to our third and that is proteins.
[00:09:25 -> 00:09:30]  When we hear proteins, many people think of muscles.
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:35]  But there are other things that proteins make in our body besides muscles.
[00:09:35 -> 00:09:45]  Proteins consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and the new element added is nitrogen.
[00:09:45 -> 00:09:50]  Proteins consist of chains of amino acids called peptides.
[00:09:50 -> 00:10:02]  A protein may be made from a single polypeptide chain or may have a more complex structure where polypeptide subunits pack together to form a unit.
[00:10:02 -> 00:10:09]  Remember, some proteins contain other atoms such as sulfur, phosphorus, iron, copper, and magnesium.
[00:10:09 -> 00:10:12]  Proteins serve many functions in cells.
[00:10:12 -> 00:10:17]  The uses of proteins in our body is, first, cellular structures.
[00:10:17 -> 00:10:21]  One of the cellular structures out of the many is our hair.
[00:10:21 -> 00:10:25]  Next, control substances in and out of the cell.
[00:10:25 -> 00:10:29]  Proteins are useful for receptors and transport channels.
[00:10:29 -> 00:10:31]  And lastly, is for our immunity.
[00:10:31 -> 00:10:36]  It can help us fight diseases with antibodies that are made of proteins.
[00:10:36 -> 00:10:41]  Now, let us take a look at the different examples of proteins.
[00:10:41 -> 00:10:45]  We have hemoglobin in our blood.
[00:10:47 -> 00:10:51]  We have collagen and insulin.
[00:10:51 -> 00:10:56]  We also have keratin, myoglobin, and fibrin.
[00:10:59 -> 00:11:08]  Now, let us proceed to the last type of organic compound that we are going to discuss and that is nucleic acids.
[00:11:08 -> 00:11:16]  This may be a new word that some of you haven't ever heard before but I'm sure you'll recognize them after we discuss this.
[00:11:16 -> 00:11:31]  The elements found in nucleic acids are, of course, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen just like protein, and now we have a new one that is P for phosphorus.
[00:11:31 -> 00:11:38]  The phosphorus comes in because the building blocks of nucleic acids are called nucleotides.
[00:11:38 -> 00:11:50]  Nucleotides are composed of P which is our phosphate group attached to a sugar which varies depending on what type of nucleic acid you're using.
[00:11:50 -> 00:11:58]  And then we have nitrogenous or nitrogen base and there are five different bases that can be used.
[00:11:58 -> 00:12:07]  Nucleic acids are the molecules in our cells that direct and store information for reproduction and cellular growth.
[00:12:08 -> 00:12:11]  There are two types of nucleic acids.
[00:12:11 -> 00:12:18]  The first one is RNA which stands for ribonucleic acid.
[00:12:19 -> 00:12:26]  The ribo stands for the type of sugar that is used which in this case is called ribose.
[00:12:26 -> 00:12:33]  RNA has only one single strand as shown in your screen right now.
[00:12:33 -> 00:12:42]  The second type of nucleic acids is DNA which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.
[00:12:42 -> 00:12:44]  Can you repeat after me class?
[00:12:44 -> 00:12:48]  Deoxyribonucleic acid.
[00:12:50 -> 00:12:57]  The deoxyribo is for the sugar that's used and in this case it is the deoxyribose.
[00:12:57 -> 00:13:13]  In DNA, instead of having one strand of nucleotides, it's actually a mirror image almost on the opposite side and it is called the double-stranded helix which it twists on itself.
[00:13:13 -> 00:13:18]  The DNA carries the genetic information for the cells.
[00:13:18 -> 00:13:26]  Sections of a DNA molecule called genes contain the information to make a protein.
[00:13:26 -> 00:13:29]  DNA serves two main functions.
[00:13:29 -> 00:13:34]  Molecules of DNA can produce other DNA molecules and RNA molecules.
[00:13:34 -> 00:13:40]  RNA molecules are directly responsible for synthesis of proteins.
[00:13:40 -> 00:13:45]  And that is all for the four types of organic compounds.
[00:13:45 -> 00:13:54]  For our conclusion, organic compounds are important because all living organisms contain carbon.
[00:13:54 -> 00:13:59]  They are the basic components of many of the cycles that drive the earth.
[00:13:59 -> 00:14:03]  And that is it for our lesson this week.
[00:14:03 -> 00:14:07]  I hope this brings enlightenment in our topic organic compounds.
