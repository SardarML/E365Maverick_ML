[00:00:00 -> 00:00:09]  Today we are going to talk about the development of human personality, right.
[00:00:09 -> 00:00:13]  First of all we should define what is personality.
[00:00:13 -> 00:00:19]  You know all of you have the concept that different people have different types of personality
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:27]  and everyone has a unique way of thought patterns, emotional patterns and behavioral patterns,
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:28]  right.
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:33]  So I have my own ways of thought patterns, behavioral patterns and emotional patterns
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:37]  which are more or less consistent over the time, right.
[00:00:37 -> 00:00:45]  So all my thought patterns and my behavioral patterns and my emotional patterns put together
[00:00:45 -> 00:00:47]  defines my personality.
[00:00:47 -> 00:00:52]  Now the question is that that why different people have different personality.
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:57]  All of you must be knowing that all of you do not have same personality.
[00:00:57 -> 00:00:59]  Why all of you have different personality?
[00:00:59 -> 00:01:08]  The main reason is that that we are primarily driven by our unconscious mind.
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:11]  Let me tell you by an example.
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:17]  Let us suppose there is same situation and under same circumstances do you think all
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:21]  of you behave in the same way?
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:22]  What do you think?
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:26]  My question is under same circumstances do you think all of you behave in the same way
[00:01:26 -> 00:01:28]  or slightly different way?
[00:01:28 -> 00:01:29]  Different way.
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:30]  Why?
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:35]  May be present circumstances are same for all of you but why would you behave in a different
[00:01:35 -> 00:01:36]  way?
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:44]  The reason being that our mind are having lot of information about our emotional patterns,
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:51]  behavioral patterns, right and about our thought patterns and everyone has those patterns different
[00:01:51 -> 00:01:53]  from each other.
[00:01:53 -> 00:01:56]  Now from where those patterns come?
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:00]  Why under the same circumstances we behave in a different way?
[00:02:00 -> 00:02:08]  If you ask Sigmund Freud this question, he will say different people behave under the
[00:02:08 -> 00:02:17]  same circumstances in different way because they have different unconscious mind.
[00:02:17 -> 00:02:22]  Now the question is that what is unconscious mind, right?
[00:02:23 -> 00:02:27]  Okay, I will start asking you certain questions.
[00:02:27 -> 00:02:31]  This lecture is going to be an interactive lecture and by your answers we will deduct
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:32]  certain things.
[00:02:32 -> 00:02:41]  According to Freud, he says if all your mental activity is put into a container, suppose
[00:02:41 -> 00:02:48]  from Mr. Ozturk, we take all his mental life, mental activity, all his thoughts, all his
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:57]  dreams, all his fantasies, all his memory, all his experiences, everything from his mental
[00:02:57 -> 00:03:01]  life we put into this container, right?
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:07]  This container is having his all mental life past and present.
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:13]  Now what really happens that Freud says that there are three layers of the mind.
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:17]  One is very superficial layer.
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:22]  Some information is present in very superficial layer of mental life and most of the things
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:24]  are in deeper layer.
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:29]  I will ask him certain questions and let's see how he answers.
[00:03:29 -> 00:03:33]  Mr. Ozturk, do you know where you are present right now?
[00:03:33 -> 00:03:37]  You are sitting in a hospital or lecture room or you know it.
[00:03:37 -> 00:03:40]  You know who are the people around you?
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:41]  But you know some idea.
[00:03:41 -> 00:03:44]  Most of them are medical students or doctors.
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:47]  You are knowing where in the world you are?
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:48]  You know it?
[00:03:48 -> 00:03:49]  Okay.
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:54]  So he is aware of his self, he is aware of his surroundings, right?
[00:03:54 -> 00:03:59]  And all this information is present in his superficial layer.
[00:03:59 -> 00:04:07]  And this superficial layer of mental activity in which all present aware, awareness is present,
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:12]  we call it conscious mind.
[00:04:12 -> 00:04:14]  So what is conscious mind?
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:20]  Conscious mind is that layer of the mental activity about which we are right now very
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:22]  much aware.
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:28]  You know who you are, you know where you are, you know who are the people around you.
[00:04:28 -> 00:04:30]  All this activity is in which layer?
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:31]  Conscious layer of your mind.
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:39]  But there are certain other thoughts or fantasies or mental activity which are in deeper layer
[00:04:39 -> 00:04:44]  of the mind and right now you may not be aware of that activity.
[00:04:44 -> 00:04:52]  Again listen, right now there is some mental activity and some thought or fantasy experiences
[00:04:52 -> 00:04:59]  are present in your mind which are not right now in your conscious layer.
[00:04:59 -> 00:05:08]  For example, I ask a question to this man, do you remember the first girl you fell in
[00:05:08 -> 00:05:09]  love with?
[00:05:09 -> 00:05:10]  You remember her?
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:11]  Good.
[00:05:11 -> 00:05:15]  Were you thinking about that girl right now?
[00:05:15 -> 00:05:20]  Before I ask question, were you thinking about that very girl?
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:23]  You were right now thinking about that girl?
[00:05:23 -> 00:05:25]  Okay he started blushing.
[00:05:25 -> 00:05:30]  I think we should go to some person who is less reactive about his first girlfriend.
[00:05:30 -> 00:05:33]  Okay let's go to Mr. Oztok.
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:36]  I hope he ever had a girlfriend.
[00:05:36 -> 00:05:42]  So Oztok do you remember that lady with whom you fell in love first time in your life?
[00:05:42 -> 00:05:44]  Yes I do, but I wasn't thinking about her.
[00:05:44 -> 00:05:50]  Okay he make it clear, he says yes there was a lady and I was in love with her but he says
[00:05:50 -> 00:05:54]  right now he was not thinking about that very lady.
[00:05:55 -> 00:06:03]  It means all his memories or experiences or fantasies about that lady were not present
[00:06:03 -> 00:06:10]  in his conscious mind but with little effort he could bring those information to the conscious
[00:06:10 -> 00:06:11]  mind.
[00:06:11 -> 00:06:12]  Is that right?
[00:06:12 -> 00:06:19]  If I ask you that you have done your high school from which country?
[00:06:19 -> 00:06:20]  Puerto Rico.
[00:06:20 -> 00:06:25]  But before I asked you question, were you thinking about that?
[00:06:25 -> 00:06:30]  No but when I asked you question with little mental effort you brought the information
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:31]  to conscious level.
[00:06:31 -> 00:06:38]  So what really happens that below this conscious layer there is another layer of all mental
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:46]  activity in which there is lot of information present and from here you can bring the information
[00:06:46 -> 00:06:49]  up to superficial layer.
[00:06:49 -> 00:06:55]  You have lot of memories, lot of thoughts, lot of feelings present into this deeper layer
[00:06:55 -> 00:07:00]  and with a little effort you can bring this information here.
[00:07:00 -> 00:07:05]  For example if I asked you how you got admission in UNIBE, can you answer that?
[00:07:05 -> 00:07:07]  You remember somehow what was the process?
[00:07:07 -> 00:07:14]  How you got admission in your medical school or you don't remember at all?
[00:07:14 -> 00:07:16]  You do remember right?
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:17]  Why?
[00:07:17 -> 00:07:21]  Because that information you can take from here up to here.
[00:07:21 -> 00:07:27]  So this layer of the mind from where you can take the information up to conscious level,
[00:07:27 -> 00:07:34]  this layer of the mental activity is called pre-conscious.
[00:07:34 -> 00:07:35]  What it is called?
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:36]  Pre-conscious.
[00:07:36 -> 00:07:37]  Pre-conscious.
[00:07:37 -> 00:07:40]  So now we have talked about two layers of mental life.
[00:07:40 -> 00:07:45]  This most superficial layer of mental life, that is about your conscious layer.
[00:07:45 -> 00:07:51]  In conscious layer you are only thinking about present, who you are, where you are, what
[00:07:51 -> 00:07:55]  you are doing, is that right, what is the time, you are aware of all these things.
[00:07:55 -> 00:07:58]  That is your conscious mental activity.
[00:07:58 -> 00:08:04]  But with little effort you can bring some information from your past up to your present
[00:08:04 -> 00:08:07]  awareness.
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:21]  And this layer which has past experiences, past feelings and past fantasies, and these
[00:08:21 -> 00:08:25]  all information can be brought to the conscious layer.
[00:08:25 -> 00:08:28]  So this layer is called pre-conscious.
[00:08:28 -> 00:08:30]  Is that clear?
[00:08:30 -> 00:08:32]  Now we go to the real, real, real mind.
[00:08:32 -> 00:08:35]  There is a very deep area there.
[00:08:35 -> 00:08:37]  I think I removed this part.
[00:08:37 -> 00:08:43]  Below the conscious layer and pre-conscious layer, there is a dark area.
[00:08:43 -> 00:08:47]  Because there is some information here, you cannot bring it here.
[00:08:47 -> 00:08:55]  For example, I ask you a question, when you were about six months old, there must have
[00:08:55 -> 00:09:00]  been a time when you were tiny six month old, and you were crying, you were very hungry.
[00:09:00 -> 00:09:05]  Do you remember there was one Friday and you were very small six month old baby and you
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:12]  were very hungry and you were crying and your mother did not attend you immediately.
[00:09:12 -> 00:09:13]  Do you remember that?
[00:09:13 -> 00:09:14]  No.
[00:09:14 -> 00:09:15]  No.
[00:09:15 -> 00:09:16]  Okay.
[00:09:16 -> 00:09:20]  Then you remember another Sunday when you were about eight months old and you were very
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:23]  hungry and your mother immediately started breastfeeding you?
[00:09:23 -> 00:09:25]  You don't remember?
[00:09:25 -> 00:09:28]  He is telling a lie.
[00:09:28 -> 00:09:32]  Actually his conscious and pre-conscious mind does not remember.
[00:09:32 -> 00:09:38]  This deeper layer of the mind remembers everything.
[00:09:38 -> 00:09:47]  Every experience which happens in your life, every feeling you have and every fantasy you
[00:09:47 -> 00:09:54]  have, that is present in your unconscious mind, the deepest layer.
[00:09:55 -> 00:10:02]  There is a lot of information present in deeper layers of the mind and this information which
[00:10:02 -> 00:10:10]  is present at this layer, you cannot bring up to conscious mind with simple efforts.
[00:10:10 -> 00:10:12]  Let me tell you.
[00:10:12 -> 00:10:18]  Let us suppose one of you had a very good mother and who was the mother who was taking
[00:10:18 -> 00:10:25]  care of the person very good, feeding him properly, changing the diapers in time and
[00:10:25 -> 00:10:28]  emotionally keeping the baby very comfortable.
[00:10:28 -> 00:10:36]  You may not remember but your unconscious mind must be remembering those group of experiences
[00:10:36 -> 00:10:42]  and because when you were just one year old and if your primary caretaker or mother was
[00:10:42 -> 00:10:51]  very good to you and she was giving good care to you, at that very time your whole world
[00:10:51 -> 00:10:54]  was only your primary caretaker.
[00:10:54 -> 00:10:58]  At that very time your whole world was just your mother.
[00:10:58 -> 00:11:04]  You never knew at that very time what was happening in other countries, what was happening
[00:11:04 -> 00:11:05]  in the wars.
[00:11:05 -> 00:11:09]  You only knew if mother is good, everything is good.
[00:11:09 -> 00:11:11]  If mother is not good, nothing is good.
[00:11:11 -> 00:11:13]  You remember that?
[00:11:13 -> 00:11:19]  Now those times actually you have forgotten but your unconscious mind has not forgotten
[00:11:19 -> 00:11:22]  those experiences.
[00:11:22 -> 00:11:27]  Now if you were treated very well during your first year of life, you have been treated
[00:11:27 -> 00:11:37]  very well, it means that those experiences which are present over here, they are not
[00:11:37 -> 00:11:41]  forgotten and they are still driving your behavior.
[00:11:41 -> 00:11:43]  Let me tell you how.
[00:11:43 -> 00:11:50]  When during first year of your life you have taken good care, you develop a trust to your
[00:11:50 -> 00:11:54]  mother that whenever you need your mother is there, when you are in trouble your mother
[00:11:54 -> 00:11:58]  is there, whenever you are hungry your mother is there, whenever you are wet your mother
[00:11:58 -> 00:12:00]  is there.
[00:12:00 -> 00:12:09]  So your little unconscious mind thought that whole world is good and as you decided at
[00:12:09 -> 00:12:17]  that very time your mind started trusting the mother, right?
[00:12:17 -> 00:12:21]  That those group of experiences are still in unconscious mind and now you are still
[00:12:21 -> 00:12:25]  carrying those experiences with you.
[00:12:25 -> 00:12:30]  And now if you need to trust someone, those experiences will help you to make decision
[00:12:30 -> 00:12:33]  that you should trust or you should not trust.
[00:12:33 -> 00:12:40]  There are other people who are unfortunately in their first year of life not treated well
[00:12:40 -> 00:12:46]  and at that very time when they were not treated well, they thought mother is not predictable,
[00:12:46 -> 00:12:52]  mother is not trustworthy and their unconscious mind with those negative experiences is so
[00:12:52 -> 00:12:58]  strong that today when they are going to make a deal, their unconscious mind is telling
[00:12:58 -> 00:13:01]  them not to trust.
[00:13:01 -> 00:13:06]  Now you may be thinking how our mind can be so fool that project the experiences of
[00:13:06 -> 00:13:10]  first year of life and mother experiences to the rest of the world.
[00:13:10 -> 00:13:17]  Answer is that your unconscious mind does not think in a logical fashion.
[00:13:17 -> 00:13:22]  Your unconscious mind does not think in a logical fashion.
[00:13:22 -> 00:13:24]  This is number one reality.
[00:13:24 -> 00:13:29]  Number two logical thinking is conscious mind.
[00:13:29 -> 00:13:32]  Unconscious mind does not think in a logical fashion.
[00:13:32 -> 00:13:37]  Then there is another special thing about unconscious mind.
[00:13:37 -> 00:13:45]  Unconscious mind does not have a concept of past, present and future.
[00:13:45 -> 00:13:50]  When you are sitting here, you can think about that these are the experiences of my present
[00:13:50 -> 00:13:51]  life.
[00:13:51 -> 00:13:54]  You may think there are some experiences which happen in the past.
[00:13:54 -> 00:13:56]  You may fantasize something about future.
[00:13:56 -> 00:14:00]  But this all activity is pre-conscious and conscious mind.
[00:14:00 -> 00:14:06]  The real, the big layer of the mind, the unconscious mind does not have a concept of past, present
[00:14:06 -> 00:14:08]  and future.
[00:14:08 -> 00:14:16]  Whatever happened in your past, all information which is present here is not considered as
[00:14:16 -> 00:14:18]  past experiences.
[00:14:18 -> 00:14:23]  Unconscious mind keeps them as present.
[00:14:23 -> 00:14:26]  Another trouble with the unconscious mind.
[00:14:26 -> 00:14:33]  Unconscious mind cannot differentiate between fantasy and reality.
[00:14:33 -> 00:14:38]  Unconscious mind cannot differentiate between fantasy and reality.
[00:14:38 -> 00:14:40]  Is that right?
[00:14:40 -> 00:14:45]  Whatever you fantasize for your conscious mind, you know it is not real.
[00:14:45 -> 00:14:51]  But for unconscious mind, it is as real as real experiences.
[00:14:51 -> 00:14:53]  So what I am telling you about unconscious mind.
[00:14:53 -> 00:14:56]  It's a big storehouse of information.
[00:14:56 -> 00:15:00]  All of you have unconscious mind with lot of information.
[00:15:00 -> 00:15:07]  All your life, whatever good experiences or bad experiences you have, whatever good feelings
[00:15:07 -> 00:15:12]  you had or bad feelings you had, whatever good fantasies you had or bad fantasies you
[00:15:12 -> 00:15:19]  had, whatever happened in your past, that is buried in your unconscious.
[00:15:19 -> 00:15:26]  And many of those things are buried so deep that with your special effort, even by your
[00:15:26 -> 00:15:31]  effort you cannot bring most of this information to unconscious mind.
[00:15:31 -> 00:15:34]  So you may think that you have forgotten those things.
[00:15:34 -> 00:15:41]  But your unconscious has not forgotten those past experiences, past feelings, past fantasies.
[00:15:41 -> 00:15:44]  It has just buried them.
[00:15:44 -> 00:15:50]  And it has buried those all experiences, buried them as alive.
[00:15:50 -> 00:15:53]  Normally we have a concept, we bury something that is dead.
[00:15:53 -> 00:15:58]  But whatever is buried in your unconscious is not dead, it is buried alive.
[00:15:58 -> 00:16:03]  And it is still today, right now is working there.
[00:16:03 -> 00:16:07]  And it is still controlling your decisions of today.
[00:16:07 -> 00:16:11]  For example, I am the same teacher to all of you.
[00:16:11 -> 00:16:15]  But do you think all of you like me in the same way or different way?
[00:16:15 -> 00:16:16]  Different way.
[00:16:16 -> 00:16:18]  Some of you may like me very much.
[00:16:18 -> 00:16:21]  Some of you may like me just little bit.
[00:16:21 -> 00:16:27]  And even some of you may hate me for no good reason.
[00:16:27 -> 00:16:28]  Why?
[00:16:28 -> 00:16:37]  May be, problem may be your relationship in the past with your father.
[00:16:37 -> 00:16:47]  For example, if your father was very good with you in your life, then any other significant
[00:16:47 -> 00:16:54]  person come in your life, you will try to have positive experiences.
[00:16:54 -> 00:16:58]  And if you have some very negative experience from your father, you find it difficult even
[00:16:58 -> 00:17:01]  to adjust with your teachers.
[00:17:01 -> 00:17:09]  The reason being, you may find that same teacher, you may have the same teacher but
[00:17:09 -> 00:17:12]  all of you may have different feelings about him.
[00:17:12 -> 00:17:14]  Problem is not with the teachers.
[00:17:14 -> 00:17:19]  The difference is in your unconscious previous experiences.
[00:17:19 -> 00:17:22]  Of course, some teachers are good because they activate good things of your unconscious
[00:17:22 -> 00:17:23]  mind.
[00:17:23 -> 00:17:27]  And some are really not good because they activate really not good things from your
[00:17:27 -> 00:17:28]  mind.
[00:17:28 -> 00:17:29]  Right?
[00:17:29 -> 00:17:34]  But you have to remember that today whatever you did with the people or with yourself,
[00:17:34 -> 00:17:40]  you say that you did it logically but actually you were controlled by unconscious mind.
[00:17:40 -> 00:17:43]  And this is the real control of your behavior.
[00:17:43 -> 00:17:47]  And this real control does not take in a logical way.
[00:17:47 -> 00:17:54]  That is why sometimes under the same circumstances, people may have different behaviors.
[00:17:54 -> 00:17:55]  Is that right?
[00:17:55 -> 00:17:57]  So is that clear to all of you?
[00:17:57 -> 00:18:03]  That basically personality consists of all your patterns of behavior, your patterns of
[00:18:03 -> 00:18:06]  emotional life and patterns of your thoughts.
[00:18:06 -> 00:18:10]  But why different people have different personalities?
[00:18:10 -> 00:18:14]  Because they have different unconscious mind.
[00:18:14 -> 00:18:15]  Am I clear?
[00:18:15 -> 00:18:18]  Now we can move forward.
[00:18:18 -> 00:18:25]  Now about the development of personality, there are two main people, two main psychologists
[00:18:25 -> 00:18:29]  who talked about how the personality developed.
[00:18:29 -> 00:18:33]  One is the, all of you have heard of him, Sigmund Freud, right?
[00:18:33 -> 00:18:38]  And second is, some of you may have heard him, that he is Eric Erickson.
[00:18:38 -> 00:18:44]  So I will talk about both of them, how they developed the theories about your mental and
[00:18:44 -> 00:18:47]  personality development, right?
[00:18:47 -> 00:18:53]  Again, all your past experiences are buried alive in your unconscious mind and they keep
[00:18:53 -> 00:18:59]  on influencing your past, keep on influencing your present, right?
[00:18:59 -> 00:19:04]  Now we will see how the personality start developing, right?
[00:19:04 -> 00:19:10]  Here I will write the first stage of development from the Eric Erickson.
[00:19:10 -> 00:19:14]  This is the foundation of personality and gradually will move upward.
[00:19:14 -> 00:19:25]  This is the first stage of development by the Dr. Eric Erickson.
[00:19:25 -> 00:19:35]  And here we will start developing the stages according to Sigmund Freud.
[00:19:35 -> 00:19:43]  Now, first stage of development means first year of life, right?
[00:19:43 -> 00:19:53]  In the first year of life, according to Freud, the first stage of development is oral stage.
[00:19:53 -> 00:19:54]  Oral stage.
[00:19:54 -> 00:19:58]  And then I will explain that stage also.
[00:19:58 -> 00:19:59]  What is oral stage?
[00:19:59 -> 00:20:00]  Let me tell you.
[00:20:00 -> 00:20:05]  When Freud tried to explain the development of human personality, he said that at different
[00:20:05 -> 00:20:15]  stages of life, early life, different parts of our body become the center of our pleasure.
[00:20:15 -> 00:20:21]  For example, according to Freud, and even you can observe it, during the first year
[00:20:21 -> 00:20:25]  of life, baby drives pleasure from which part of the body?
[00:20:25 -> 00:20:31]  Babies, small babies, six month old baby, or one year, mouth.
[00:20:31 -> 00:20:32]  Have you seen it?
[00:20:32 -> 00:20:35]  Small baby has all the pleasure from here.
[00:20:35 -> 00:20:38]  What he is trying to do?
[00:20:38 -> 00:20:43]  Whatever he finds, he will put it in his mouth because he wants to get some pleasure.
[00:20:43 -> 00:20:47]  Actually oral stimulation gives the pleasure to the baby.
[00:20:47 -> 00:20:53]  According to Freud, this is a special pleasure center during the first year of life.
[00:20:53 -> 00:20:57]  And whatever you do, you put the baby's hand away, he will put it in.
[00:20:57 -> 00:21:00]  You put it away, he will put it in again.
[00:21:00 -> 00:21:04]  All pleasure is coming from his oral area.
[00:21:04 -> 00:21:07]  Is that right?
[00:21:07 -> 00:21:10]  And why oral area is so important?
[00:21:10 -> 00:21:13]  Because for baby, it's the whole world.
[00:21:13 -> 00:21:20]  From oral area, he gets connected with the mother, who is primary caretaker.
[00:21:20 -> 00:21:24]  From oral area, baby is going to get the nutrition.
[00:21:24 -> 00:21:31]  From oral activity, when baby is suckling to the breast, he gets not only nutrition,
[00:21:31 -> 00:21:34]  but emotional love.
[00:21:34 -> 00:21:39]  And baby also gets physical support and warmth.
[00:21:39 -> 00:21:43]  So all baby's pleasure is around oral area.
[00:21:43 -> 00:21:46]  From where baby discovers oral area, to stimulate the oral area is great.
[00:21:46 -> 00:21:51]  Because very early experience after birth told baby that whenever something, nipple
[00:21:51 -> 00:21:58]  come in mouth, baby feels great, well protected, warm, emotionally secure.
[00:21:58 -> 00:22:00]  Is that right or not?
[00:22:00 -> 00:22:01]  And nutrition.
[00:22:01 -> 00:22:06]  So baby thinks that if I'm having pleasure from this area, let me get more and more pleasure.
[00:22:06 -> 00:22:10]  So when nipple is not there, he'll put his finger in mouth.
[00:22:10 -> 00:22:11]  Or mothers are clever.
[00:22:11 -> 00:22:15]  When they are not there, they put some sort of thing, you know, plastic thing in baby's
[00:22:15 -> 00:22:16]  mouth.
[00:22:16 -> 00:22:17]  What do you call it?
[00:22:17 -> 00:22:18]  Right?
[00:22:18 -> 00:22:19]  Why they put it there?
[00:22:19 -> 00:22:21]  So that baby remains.
[00:22:21 -> 00:22:25]  And feeling that I'm having good pleasure.
[00:22:25 -> 00:22:27]  Something mother-like is there.
[00:22:27 -> 00:22:28]  Is that right?
[00:22:28 -> 00:22:34]  So fried cows, their first stage of personality development is oral stage.
[00:22:34 -> 00:22:35]  Is that right?
[00:22:35 -> 00:22:38]  You are developing gratification only from oral area.
[00:22:38 -> 00:22:44]  You may be laughing that what this breastfeeding or oral stimulation has to do with your personality.
[00:22:44 -> 00:22:49]  It has to do something with your personality.
[00:22:49 -> 00:22:51]  How?
[00:22:51 -> 00:22:57]  Because even some people, they remain fixated at this stage.
[00:22:57 -> 00:23:01]  They don't pass through this stage to the next stage properly.
[00:23:01 -> 00:23:05]  I will tell you later another area, baby will discover one more area in his own body to
[00:23:05 -> 00:23:06]  enjoy.
[00:23:06 -> 00:23:13]  But right now, in first year, he is working on his oral area and feeling great.
[00:23:13 -> 00:23:17]  Already I told you, whatever experiences you have through oral area during your first
[00:23:17 -> 00:23:23]  year of life, you may have forgotten, your unconscious mind has never forgotten.
[00:23:23 -> 00:23:28]  So even today, listen now carefully, even today when you are adult, some of you when
[00:23:28 -> 00:23:34]  you go under stress, you reverse to your oral phase.
[00:23:34 -> 00:23:35]  Let me give you an example.
[00:23:35 -> 00:23:40]  First of all, when you are just six, seven month old and you had some sort of stress,
[00:23:40 -> 00:23:41]  what do you do?
[00:23:41 -> 00:23:42]  You cry?
[00:23:42 -> 00:23:48]  Your mom puts you with her breast, nipple is in your mouth and you feel great.
[00:23:48 -> 00:23:49]  Your stress is gone.
[00:23:49 -> 00:23:52]  Is that true or not?
[00:23:52 -> 00:24:01]  Now you are adult, grown up adult, intelligent, but still your unconscious mind is same.
[00:24:01 -> 00:24:09]  So some of you even go under stress today, you will reverse to the oral phase.
[00:24:09 -> 00:24:15]  For example, some of you when you are under stress, what you do?
[00:24:15 -> 00:24:17]  You eat more.
[00:24:17 -> 00:24:18]  What you are doing?
[00:24:18 -> 00:24:21]  You are doing oral gratification.
[00:24:21 -> 00:24:25]  Some of you may be complaining, you know, I am under stress, I have to eat more.
[00:24:25 -> 00:24:26]  What you are saying?
[00:24:26 -> 00:24:29]  I am under stress, I need something like breast and nipple.
[00:24:29 -> 00:24:31]  Okay, I cannot get it.
[00:24:31 -> 00:24:34]  Give me lot of rice and few things.
[00:24:34 -> 00:24:37]  I keep on putting and my unconscious mind will get satisfied.
[00:24:37 -> 00:24:39]  There is something great coming into this area.
[00:24:39 -> 00:24:41]  Is that right?
[00:24:41 -> 00:24:47]  Now you are grown up, everyone has different ways to gratify the oral area, right?
[00:24:47 -> 00:24:54]  Some of you by eating more under stress, even you have seen, even some of you, I think you
[00:24:54 -> 00:25:00]  won't be telling others, but sometimes you come across an adult under extreme stress,
[00:25:00 -> 00:25:01]  he may start thumb-sunkling.
[00:25:01 -> 00:25:05]  Okay, you mind it, forget about it.
[00:25:05 -> 00:25:07]  I will tell you a simple example.
[00:25:07 -> 00:25:12]  Look at the strong men and women who are at the prime of youth, feel very strong, little
[00:25:12 -> 00:25:18]  bit stressed, they put what is that stick, they call cigarette in their mouth.
[00:25:18 -> 00:25:23]  And these people who are addicted to cigarettes, if you tell them this is nicotine patch, we
[00:25:23 -> 00:25:28]  will deliver you as good nicotine, but I think they need something here also.
[00:25:28 -> 00:25:32]  That gives them relaxation.
[00:25:32 -> 00:25:38]  You know, they keep cigarette here, feel great, they puff out, again feel great.
[00:25:38 -> 00:25:40]  Is that right?
[00:25:40 -> 00:25:43]  That is reversing back to oral stage.
[00:25:43 -> 00:25:47]  Your unconscious mind is driving you back, controlling you back.
[00:25:47 -> 00:25:50]  Let's go to that nipple stage and mouth stage.
[00:25:50 -> 00:25:53]  Let me tell you another example.
[00:25:53 -> 00:25:57]  Some of you don't smoke, but what you do, when exam come, you put the pencil in your
[00:25:57 -> 00:26:00]  mouth, what happened to your pencil?
[00:26:00 -> 00:26:02]  It's not giving you any nutrition.
[00:26:02 -> 00:26:03]  What is happening?
[00:26:03 -> 00:26:09]  Your unconscious mind compulsing you, pushing you to put something in mouth, right?
[00:26:09 -> 00:26:12]  And you are not baby, you don't want to put thumb, so what do you do?
[00:26:12 -> 00:26:13]  You put pencil.
[00:26:13 -> 00:26:15]  What is that?
[00:26:15 -> 00:26:21]  Another way to fight with stress, a proof that unconscious mind is still working in
[00:26:21 -> 00:26:27]  a very, very primitive behavior, oral gratification, right?
[00:26:27 -> 00:26:31]  Some of you, you don't like to put dirty pencils in your mouth.
[00:26:31 -> 00:26:36]  You may love to put a lot of chingum, especially under chewing gum and keep on doing it.
[00:26:36 -> 00:26:40]  More you stress, more you chew and grind and grind, right?
[00:26:40 -> 00:26:42]  Oral gratification.
[00:26:42 -> 00:26:54]  Then, yeah, some of you love the, what is that, oral gratification, one more fixation.
[00:26:54 -> 00:26:58]  You know, kissing, kissing, lip to lip kissing.
[00:26:58 -> 00:27:01]  Some of you enjoy less and some of you are willing to die for that.
[00:27:01 -> 00:27:02]  Why?
[00:27:02 -> 00:27:11]  Again, it depends on, for example, there is a boy who likes kissing, but he somehow come
[00:27:11 -> 00:27:15]  across a rare type of girl who likes kissing too much.
[00:27:15 -> 00:27:16]  What's the problem with them?
[00:27:16 -> 00:27:20]  There is mismatch on requirement of love through kissing.
[00:27:20 -> 00:27:21]  Why there is mismatch?
[00:27:21 -> 00:27:24]  The unconscious are different.
[00:27:24 -> 00:27:28]  You are understanding?
[00:27:28 -> 00:27:34]  So oral gratification in adult phases like kissing, even flasho and other activities
[00:27:34 -> 00:27:39]  which are done orally, oral sex, some of you may be doing a lot and some of you don't
[00:27:39 -> 00:27:40]  like it.
[00:27:40 -> 00:27:44]  It depends on what were your early experiences.
[00:27:44 -> 00:27:46]  Don't hate me for this information.
[00:27:46 -> 00:27:50]  Like other people, you can also abuse Mr. Segment Fried who discovered this thing for
[00:27:50 -> 00:27:52]  you, right?
[00:27:52 -> 00:27:59]  So according to Segment Fried, the first stage of personality development is lying around
[00:27:59 -> 00:28:05]  your, the area of the mouth from where you get the gratification or player center we
[00:28:05 -> 00:28:08]  call it, right?
[00:28:08 -> 00:28:14]  During the same time, when Fried says that baby is developing his all, player around
[00:28:14 -> 00:28:25]  mouth, Eric Rickson says that baby's personality develop not only on psychosexual activity
[00:28:25 -> 00:28:29]  but also depends on psychosocial activity.
[00:28:29 -> 00:28:37]  Fried model is that personality develop on psychosexual activities and Eric Rickson model
[00:28:37 -> 00:28:42]  is that personality develop on psychosocial interaction.
[00:28:42 -> 00:28:48]  So when baby is during the first year of life, he is also, he is also doing another important
[00:28:48 -> 00:28:49]  work.
[00:28:49 -> 00:28:54]  He is doing some certain very important decision in his mind.
[00:28:54 -> 00:29:02]  According to Eric Rickson, whenever you are at any special stage of your life, there are
[00:29:02 -> 00:29:11]  two forces which are producing emotional and social crisis and those mental forces, one
[00:29:11 -> 00:29:14]  force is positive and other force is negative.
[00:29:14 -> 00:29:15]  Let me explain.
[00:29:15 -> 00:29:23]  For example, according to Eric Rickson, during the first year of life, mental activity has
[00:29:23 -> 00:29:26]  to be centered on two opposite forces.
[00:29:26 -> 00:29:30]  One force is trust.
[00:29:30 -> 00:29:40]  During the first year of life, baby has to decide world is trustworthy or not or its
[00:29:40 -> 00:29:49]  opposite, its opposite negative aspect is mistrust.
[00:29:49 -> 00:29:58]  Now while baby is enjoying the oral gratification, baby's mind is working on something else.
[00:29:58 -> 00:30:05]  Baby's mind is working and solving the problem of should the baby trust the people, trust
[00:30:05 -> 00:30:08]  the world or should not trust the world.
[00:30:08 -> 00:30:11]  The question is that how baby decides these two things.
[00:30:11 -> 00:30:14]  This is the challenge, first challenge in baby's life.
[00:30:14 -> 00:30:18]  The first challenge is that he has to do mental task.
[00:30:18 -> 00:30:21]  If you think that infants are not working, you are mistaken.
[00:30:21 -> 00:30:23]  They are also doing very important work.
[00:30:23 -> 00:30:29]  Their mental work is that they have to decide at first year of life that up to one and a
[00:30:29 -> 00:30:34]  half year of life, they have to decide the world is trustworthy or not.
[00:30:34 -> 00:30:41]  And lessons are from that stage which are influencing your decisions today even.
[00:30:41 -> 00:30:45]  For example, some of you trust easily to the other people and some of you may not trust
[00:30:45 -> 00:30:49]  even your best friend.
[00:30:49 -> 00:30:54]  I know some of my friends, they keep on suffering but still keep on trusting.
[00:30:54 -> 00:30:58]  And there are other people who don't suffer because they don't trust anyone but they don't
[00:30:58 -> 00:31:02]  have any advantage also because you have to trust in practical life.
[00:31:02 -> 00:31:08]  But baby's mind has to decide about the trust or mistrust.
[00:31:08 -> 00:31:14]  Now this is a tension in the small mind of the baby because mothers are not perfect,
[00:31:14 -> 00:31:17]  they are also human being.
[00:31:17 -> 00:31:25]  Now when baby during first year of life is totally dependent, baby is totally dependent
[00:31:25 -> 00:31:31]  on the primary caretaker, when you are totally dependent on other, then you have to trust
[00:31:31 -> 00:31:40]  them that others will fulfill your needs, other people will go with their promise.
[00:31:40 -> 00:31:46]  For example, a very small baby, just six month old or eight month old, his mind is working
[00:31:46 -> 00:31:52]  all the time that I am a dependent person, I cannot go and make milk, I cannot change
[00:31:52 -> 00:32:00]  my diaper, I cannot control temperature of the room, so primary caretaker is going to
[00:32:00 -> 00:32:05]  Can I trust my mother or primary caretaker for my needs or not?
[00:32:05 -> 00:32:12]  For example, if mother is very caring, very loving, if she has been giving you nutrition
[00:32:12 -> 00:32:19]  properly, emotional need properly, changing your diapers, controlling the temperature,
[00:32:19 -> 00:32:23]  keeping you safe and comfortable, what you think?
[00:32:23 -> 00:32:28]  The small mind think initially my primary caretaker is good, it's trustworthy, whenever
[00:32:28 -> 00:32:33]  I am in trouble, I just give a signal of cry and usually she is there.
[00:32:33 -> 00:32:38]  The small mind start thinking that I should trust and of course sometimes mother is mother
[00:32:38 -> 00:32:45]  and human also, she is not there in time and you cry a lot and if she does not come, you
[00:32:45 -> 00:32:49]  are thinking oh, I cannot trust much.
[00:32:49 -> 00:32:57]  Now all the first year of baby life, mind is struggling between trust or not to trust.
[00:32:57 -> 00:33:02]  This is the mental tension, this is the mental challenge and this is the foundation of the
[00:33:02 -> 00:33:08]  personality, the decision which will be made at this time.
[00:33:08 -> 00:33:15]  If primary care taking has been good, then a balance will be achieved that baby will
[00:33:15 -> 00:33:22]  believe that most of the time world is mother is trustworthy but because this message is
[00:33:22 -> 00:33:28]  learned by the unconscious mind and I told you unconscious mind is not logical, you are
[00:33:28 -> 00:33:32]  still carrying that unconscious mind but that is not logical.
[00:33:32 -> 00:33:37]  Unconscious mind as you grow up, initially it thinks okay, mother is great, mother is
[00:33:37 -> 00:33:43]  trustworthy, actually for you, mother represents the whole world.
[00:33:43 -> 00:33:49]  So as you grow up, you start believing the whole world, even under worst circumstances,
[00:33:49 -> 00:33:54]  you think I can trust human race, I can trust the external world, somehow things will get
[00:33:54 -> 00:34:01]  better and if you resolve in the positive fashion, you get a very very special strength
[00:34:01 -> 00:34:08]  in your personality and if unfortunately due to sad experiences of first year of life,
[00:34:08 -> 00:34:13]  you resolve in this direction, you will put a very strong weakness in your life.
[00:34:13 -> 00:34:21]  Now, the baby who has resolved this in a positive way and decided that world is trustworthy
[00:34:21 -> 00:34:27]  in spite of sometimes my mother is not there to serve me immediately but eventually she
[00:34:27 -> 00:34:34]  comes, so baby believes in that he can trust and when you can trust the world, a special
[00:34:34 -> 00:34:41]  personality strength comes to you, that is the reward of this mental work in a positive
[00:34:41 -> 00:34:42]  way.
[00:34:42 -> 00:34:44]  Who knows that reward?
[00:34:44 -> 00:34:48]  That reward is hope.
[00:34:48 -> 00:34:53]  The strength which develops in the baby's personality is hope.
[00:34:53 -> 00:34:54]  What is hope?
[00:34:54 -> 00:35:00]  Hope is a situation when even if mother sometimes fail to give the service, baby has a hope
[00:35:00 -> 00:35:07]  she will eventually come and when that baby grow up as an adult, sometimes life become
[00:35:07 -> 00:35:15]  very hard, things look very dark and bleak, still your unconscious mind is saying you
[00:35:15 -> 00:35:20]  should be hopeful and the person who is hopeful, he will do more effort and eventually come
[00:35:20 -> 00:35:22]  out of troubles.
[00:35:22 -> 00:35:27]  Now, let me tell you an example.
[00:35:27 -> 00:35:37]  Let's suppose in your class, there is a girl and there is a boy and let's suppose that
[00:35:37 -> 00:35:45]  boy has a very unfortunately early negative experiences, right?
[00:35:45 -> 00:35:52]  So he does not have strength of hope in his personality, what will happen to that boy?
[00:35:52 -> 00:35:57]  Little bit, he fail once, he will become hopeless.
[00:35:57 -> 00:36:02]  If he fail once in his exams, he will become hopeless, when he will become hopeless, next
[00:36:02 -> 00:36:06]  time he will not study much because if you are hopeless, will you study?
[00:36:06 -> 00:36:16]  Then again you will fail or if you have this weakness in your love relationship, you have
[00:36:16 -> 00:36:22]  some disappointment and after the disappointment, if you are on this side, you will become hopeless
[00:36:22 -> 00:36:27]  very soon, you will not pursue your love relations and you will lose them but you will come across
[00:36:27 -> 00:36:34]  some people who have this strength in their personality, even in their love relation or
[00:36:34 -> 00:36:40]  in their financial situation or in their professional career, they have a big setback.
[00:36:40 -> 00:36:45]  Even after the setback, their unconscious mind is telling them, you see, I know you
[00:36:45 -> 00:36:50]  are having stress, you are having disappointment, somehow things will become okay.
[00:36:50 -> 00:36:55]  So that person will still keep on following the relationship, even it is going bad.
[00:36:55 -> 00:37:03]  So you see, the way your mother treated during your early years, that is still reflecting
[00:37:03 -> 00:37:09]  the way you behave today with the people and in your professional situations and in
[00:37:09 -> 00:37:12]  your financial situations.
[00:37:12 -> 00:37:17]  Under the same circumstances, some people are more hopeful and other people are less
[00:37:17 -> 00:37:18]  hopeful.
[00:37:18 -> 00:37:23]  It is not the circumstances, it is also depending upon how you were treated when you were totally
[00:37:23 -> 00:37:26]  dependent on one human being.
[00:37:26 -> 00:37:32]  If that human being was good for you, the whole universe is good.
[00:37:32 -> 00:37:35]  Let me tell you an extreme example.
[00:37:35 -> 00:37:39]  Have you heard of revolution of France?
[00:37:39 -> 00:37:46]  There was a lot of bloodshed that during the revolution of France, the lower class people
[00:37:46 -> 00:37:51]  right and middle class people, they had revolution against the elite class, upper class and they
[00:37:51 -> 00:37:53]  started killing everyone around.
[00:37:53 -> 00:38:00]  Of course, for the people who are in the upper class, that was a time during the revolution
[00:38:00 -> 00:38:02]  to be hopeful or hopeless?
[00:38:02 -> 00:38:03]  Hopeless.
[00:38:03 -> 00:38:04]  Hopeless.
[00:38:04 -> 00:38:06]  But there is a true story there.
[00:38:06 -> 00:38:15]  They say, there was one of the very rich French elite person, very decent and loving person.
[00:38:15 -> 00:38:22]  When revolution came, the revolutionary people, they killed most of his staff members and
[00:38:22 -> 00:38:29]  his friends and then they killed his children, killed his wife, killed his parents but he
[00:38:29 -> 00:38:33]  somehow ran away.
[00:38:33 -> 00:38:41]  He ran away and eventually he was caught and he was killed.
[00:38:41 -> 00:38:45]  When he was also killed by gluten, at that very time, from his pocket they brought a
[00:38:45 -> 00:38:46]  letter out.
[00:38:46 -> 00:38:49]  Do you know what he has written just a night before?
[00:38:49 -> 00:38:54]  He has written to the French people that I know my mother and father have been killed.
[00:38:54 -> 00:38:59]  I know my brothers and my sisters have been killed, my children have been killed.
[00:38:59 -> 00:39:06]  I know I will be killed very soon but somewhere I feel good in spite of these circumstances
[00:39:06 -> 00:39:10]  because it is good for France that middle class and upper class, middle class and lower
[00:39:10 -> 00:39:12]  class people should feel the strength.
[00:39:12 -> 00:39:15]  They are angry now with us.
[00:39:15 -> 00:39:22]  After few years, they will be less angry and they will feel more free and they will contribute
[00:39:22 -> 00:39:25]  more for the goodwill of France.
[00:39:25 -> 00:39:29]  So even in those circumstances, he was hopeful.
[00:39:29 -> 00:39:35]  Probably a lot of credit should go to his mother and you will find some people, even
[00:39:35 -> 00:39:41]  their little problem, their car goes out of order and they think whole life is hopeless.
[00:39:41 -> 00:39:46]  I think we have to prove what happened when they were three months old, right?
[00:39:47 -> 00:39:53]  That is the time you develop that either you will have what is your quota of hope, strength
[00:39:53 -> 00:39:55]  of hope.
[00:39:55 -> 00:40:00]  That is the first cornerstone in the development of human personality.
[00:40:00 -> 00:40:08]  Person with strong personality should be able to trust others even though he is realistic
[00:40:08 -> 00:40:14]  that he can be fooled but still he should be able to trust people with little mistrust
[00:40:14 -> 00:40:20]  and under even extreme circumstances, he should remain hopeful.
[00:40:20 -> 00:40:22]  Is that right?
[00:40:22 -> 00:40:27]  Now let's suppose baby has resolved this stage.
[00:40:27 -> 00:40:29]  Baby has resolved this stage.
[00:40:29 -> 00:40:33]  Now baby is one and a half year or two year old.
[00:40:33 -> 00:40:38]  When baby is two year old, new challenge will come.
[00:40:38 -> 00:40:39]  This problem is solved.
[00:40:39 -> 00:40:41]  New challenge will come.
[00:40:41 -> 00:40:44]  Another mental task baby has to do.
[00:40:44 -> 00:40:47]  What is the next mental task?
[00:40:47 -> 00:40:48]  That we'll talk here.
[00:40:48 -> 00:40:52]  What is the second mental task of the baby?
[00:40:52 -> 00:41:00]  This first task was from up to 18 months and it is from 18 months up to the second stages
[00:41:00 -> 00:41:02]  36 months up to three years.
[00:41:02 -> 00:41:04]  There is another mental task.
[00:41:04 -> 00:41:08]  With that there is another phase, developmental phase on the fright side.
[00:41:08 -> 00:41:10]  I will go to that later.
[00:41:10 -> 00:41:11]  First come here.
[00:41:11 -> 00:41:15]  Baby is now about two year old.
[00:41:15 -> 00:41:18]  He has enjoyed his oral activity a lot.
[00:41:18 -> 00:41:24]  Then he discovers there is another area in his body, a special area to drive the player.
[00:41:24 -> 00:41:26]  What is the next area baby will drive the player?
[00:41:26 -> 00:41:27]  Tongue.
[00:41:27 -> 00:41:28]  Yeah.
[00:41:28 -> 00:41:29]  Tongue.
[00:41:29 -> 00:41:32]  Babies are not that sexual.
[00:41:32 -> 00:41:35]  So anal activity.
[00:41:35 -> 00:41:42]  Babies suddenly develop a special interest in his or her anus.
[00:41:42 -> 00:41:46]  Now why they develop special interest in their anus?
[00:41:46 -> 00:41:51]  Actually they suddenly come to know that they are not totally dependent on the world.
[00:41:51 -> 00:41:52]  There are certain things they can control.
[00:41:52 -> 00:41:56]  For example, they can control their own sphincter.
[00:41:56 -> 00:41:59]  And they say it's a great thing.
[00:41:59 -> 00:42:02]  Yeah, everyone likes to grow.
[00:42:02 -> 00:42:06]  He also likes to grow from totally dependent situation to semi-independent.
[00:42:06 -> 00:42:11]  So first discovery baby feel great that I can control my sphincters.
[00:42:11 -> 00:42:16]  The problem is that around that parents start toilet training.
[00:42:16 -> 00:42:22]  Now babies start developing the player around anal area.
[00:42:22 -> 00:42:24]  And he try to control his anal activity.
[00:42:24 -> 00:42:32]  For example, if baby does not want to pass the fecal matter, he will control it.
[00:42:32 -> 00:42:37]  Sometimes baby gives so much value to their activity of the sphincter that they take pride
[00:42:37 -> 00:42:39]  in that.
[00:42:39 -> 00:42:44]  And mothers know sometimes baby put their product on something and bring to mother to
[00:42:44 -> 00:42:45]  eat.
[00:42:45 -> 00:42:47]  If mother is not cooperative, they put in their own mouth.
[00:42:47 -> 00:42:49]  Yeah, these are the true things.
[00:42:49 -> 00:42:51]  He is very proud.
[00:42:51 -> 00:42:54]  This is the first time he has a control at least on himself.
[00:42:54 -> 00:42:56]  Small baby never had it.
[00:42:56 -> 00:43:03]  So his next area of player is anal activity.
[00:43:03 -> 00:43:10]  And Freud call this stage of development, anal development of personality.
[00:43:10 -> 00:43:11]  Anal stage of development.
[00:43:11 -> 00:43:17]  So baby has gone from oral stage to anal stage.
[00:43:17 -> 00:43:18]  Is that right?
[00:43:18 -> 00:43:25]  Hence according to Eric Erickson, baby is also doing some mental activity at the same
[00:43:25 -> 00:43:26]  time.
[00:43:26 -> 00:43:30]  Now what is the second mental activity?
[00:43:30 -> 00:43:31]  That is autonomy.
[00:43:31 -> 00:43:44]  Baby feel somewhat autonomous versus shame and doubt, right?
[00:43:44 -> 00:43:53]  Now in the second stage, the mental decision is that baby has to decide, is the baby fully
[00:43:53 -> 00:43:57]  autonomous or he should have a feeling of shame and doubt.
[00:43:57 -> 00:43:58]  Let me tell you.
[00:43:58 -> 00:44:00]  How baby feel autonomous?
[00:44:00 -> 00:44:02]  Now baby can move around.
[00:44:02 -> 00:44:06]  Do you think 6 month old baby can move around?
[00:44:06 -> 00:44:07]  No.
[00:44:07 -> 00:44:09]  But 2 year old baby can move around.
[00:44:09 -> 00:44:11]  He feel autonomous independent.
[00:44:11 -> 00:44:13]  He can control his sphincters.
[00:44:13 -> 00:44:15]  He can release his material.
[00:44:15 -> 00:44:18]  He feels autonomous somewhat.
[00:44:18 -> 00:44:19]  Is that right?
[00:44:19 -> 00:44:22]  Here is around anal activity.
[00:44:22 -> 00:44:29]  At this phase, now mental task is that baby has to decide to himself how much autonomous
[00:44:29 -> 00:44:32]  baby is.
[00:44:32 -> 00:44:39]  And mother or primary caretaker around that time is doing toilet training for the baby.
[00:44:39 -> 00:44:42]  Now look at the situation.
[00:44:42 -> 00:44:46]  You know baby has started controlling his sphincters but there is no perfect control.
[00:44:46 -> 00:44:48]  Sometimes he does mistakes also.
[00:44:48 -> 00:44:49]  Is that right?
[00:44:49 -> 00:44:51]  You know.
[00:44:51 -> 00:44:59]  Now if toilet training is very tight, you know some mothers, especially the first baby,
[00:44:59 -> 00:45:03]  mothers don't have experience with raising baby, especially with the first baby, mothers
[00:45:03 -> 00:45:05]  become very active in toilet training.
[00:45:05 -> 00:45:11]  They wanted their child should have very perfect control of the sphincter as soon as possible.
[00:45:11 -> 00:45:12]  Is that right?
[00:45:12 -> 00:45:21]  And if there is over control on this stage, right, baby feels more autonomous.
[00:45:21 -> 00:45:28]  Opposite to that, there are other baby, again, if baby does a mistake, for example, he passes
[00:45:28 -> 00:45:35]  his fecal matter or urine in the bed, mother become extremely angry and punishes the baby.
[00:45:35 -> 00:45:39]  Then baby is harshly treated at this stage.
[00:45:39 -> 00:45:41]  Babies should not be harshly treated.
[00:45:41 -> 00:45:45]  I will tell you what is the problem if you harshly treat the baby at this stage.
[00:45:45 -> 00:45:48]  For example, baby is not perfect.
[00:45:48 -> 00:45:54]  He is just feeling he is autonomous and whenever he thinks his autonomy fails, he feels in
[00:45:54 -> 00:45:58]  his personality shame and doubt about his own personality.
[00:45:58 -> 00:46:04]  For example, baby does not want to pass fecal matter but somehow it goes out.
[00:46:04 -> 00:46:09]  Baby also feels shame and doubt and if mother beat him and very hard or punish, he will
[00:46:09 -> 00:46:11]  feel very much shame and doubt.
[00:46:11 -> 00:46:14]  That shame and doubt will stay all his life with him.
[00:46:14 -> 00:46:19]  I told you unconscious, baby may forget but his unconscious mind will not forget that
[00:46:19 -> 00:46:20]  experience.
[00:46:20 -> 00:46:27]  So, what really happens that baby has to experience, decide a balance between autonomy and shame
[00:46:27 -> 00:46:29]  and doubt.
[00:46:29 -> 00:46:32]  Autonomy mean you have a choice of decision.
[00:46:32 -> 00:46:36]  Shame and doubt that sometimes you make stupid decisions.
[00:46:36 -> 00:46:37]  Is that right?
[00:46:37 -> 00:46:38]  Another example.
[00:46:39 -> 00:46:44]  For example, baby want to move around and show to mother that I am autonomous.
[00:46:44 -> 00:46:51]  Very commonly around the two years of age, the favorite word of the baby is, who knows
[00:46:51 -> 00:46:56]  the favorite word babies love to say to their elders, no.
[00:46:56 -> 00:47:01]  If you ask two-year-old baby to sit down, no, I want to stand and you ask him keep standing,
[00:47:01 -> 00:47:02]  no, I want to sit.
[00:47:02 -> 00:47:07]  What he is trying to do, he is trying to show his muscles, emotional muscles that he has
[00:47:07 -> 00:47:12]  his autonomous decisions, he is not under your control.
[00:47:12 -> 00:47:15]  This personality is opening up another aspect.
[00:47:15 -> 00:47:23]  If you are good and wise parents, you will be firm with the baby but with some tolerance.
[00:47:23 -> 00:47:27]  Sometimes you will tolerate his innocence, no.
[00:47:27 -> 00:47:33]  But if you beat him, if you are harsh and punish him, then he will feel whenever I exercise
[00:47:33 -> 00:47:34]  autonomy I suffer.
[00:47:35 -> 00:47:43]  So, he will develop shame and doubt for his own decisions and shame and doubt on his capabilities.
[00:47:43 -> 00:47:44]  Is that right?
[00:47:44 -> 00:47:50]  Now, we were talking about basically second stage, autonomy versus shame.
[00:47:50 -> 00:47:55]  And the major task for baby was, what was the major task at this stage?
[00:47:55 -> 00:47:56]  Toilet training.
[00:47:56 -> 00:47:57]  Toilet?
[00:47:57 -> 00:47:58]  Training.
[00:47:58 -> 00:47:59]  Training.
[00:47:59 -> 00:48:01]  And at first stage, what was the major task?
[00:48:01 -> 00:48:02]  Feeding.
[00:48:02 -> 00:48:03]  Right?
[00:48:03 -> 00:48:10]  During the toilet training phase, if baby is over-trained and harshly trained, that
[00:48:10 -> 00:48:12]  will also produce pathology.
[00:48:12 -> 00:48:14]  You know what is the pathology?
[00:48:14 -> 00:48:16]  What is the pathology?
[00:48:16 -> 00:48:24]  Those babies become obsessive-compulsive, OCD babies, then they develop an adult.
[00:48:24 -> 00:48:32]  If you are very harshly, unduly harshly toilet-trained, all your life, not only your anal sphincters
[00:48:32 -> 00:48:37]  become tight, I think your moral and social sphincters also become tight.
[00:48:37 -> 00:48:41]  Yes?
[00:48:41 -> 00:48:44]  People become more unduly moralistic.
[00:48:44 -> 00:48:45]  They start passing judgment on others.
[00:48:45 -> 00:48:48]  They want everything to be perfect.
[00:48:48 -> 00:48:53]  Because these were their mothers, they wanted perfect control on the sphincters.
[00:48:53 -> 00:48:58]  So because they were harshly punished for their sphincter failures, so themselves they
[00:48:58 -> 00:49:00]  got very tight control on their sphincter.
[00:49:00 -> 00:49:03]  But that affects their whole personality.
[00:49:03 -> 00:49:07]  When they grow up, they want perfection in everything.
[00:49:07 -> 00:49:09]  They are obsessed with their times.
[00:49:09 -> 00:49:11]  They are obsessed with their schedules.
[00:49:11 -> 00:49:13]  They are obsessed with their programs.
[00:49:13 -> 00:49:16]  If any program changes, they get very disturbed.
[00:49:16 -> 00:49:18]  Right?
[00:49:18 -> 00:49:20]  They are very much concerned with the list of the things.
[00:49:20 -> 00:49:25]  And if anything is short, their whole world falls apart.
[00:49:25 -> 00:49:26]  Is that right?
[00:49:26 -> 00:49:28]  They are poorly trained.
[00:49:28 -> 00:49:34]  And they are having very strong moral values, whatever values they have.
[00:49:34 -> 00:49:36]  And they always keep on passing judgments on others.
[00:49:36 -> 00:49:40]  Do you think this is a pleasant personality to work?
[00:49:40 -> 00:49:41]  No.
[00:49:41 -> 00:49:47]  So usually the first child, not always, but usually the first child is trained very harshly
[00:49:47 -> 00:49:50]  and with a lot of precision by the mother.
[00:49:50 -> 00:49:56]  So these babies, when they grow up, they want to be very responsible, very much on time,
[00:49:56 -> 00:49:58]  everything according to the schedule.
[00:49:58 -> 00:49:59]  Is that right?
[00:49:59 -> 00:50:05]  And looking perfection in themselves and also looking perfection in others.
[00:50:05 -> 00:50:07]  They're not fun to be with them.
[00:50:07 -> 00:50:09]  There's no fun to be with them.
[00:50:09 -> 00:50:15]  Opposite to that, usually if a mother has five children, by fourth, fifth child, mother
[00:50:15 -> 00:50:20]  has known that even if she's not so hard on the baby, somehow sphincters start working
[00:50:20 -> 00:50:23]  on the baby with little delay.
[00:50:23 -> 00:50:27]  And mother doesn't care because she has learned with the time that even if she's not very
[00:50:27 -> 00:50:32]  hard on toilet training, somehow baby's sphincter start working.
[00:50:32 -> 00:50:37]  Then those babies have opposite problem because they don't have much training.
[00:50:37 -> 00:50:39]  They are messy in their life also.
[00:50:39 -> 00:50:43]  You go to their room, everything is messed up.
[00:50:43 -> 00:50:49]  Let's suppose, I tell you the situation, there's one person extremely tight toilet training,
[00:50:49 -> 00:50:52]  other no toilet training, little toilet training.
[00:50:52 -> 00:50:57]  The first person, when he's going to study, he want every paper in a proper way, all the
[00:50:57 -> 00:51:00]  colors of the pencil put in a special way.
[00:51:00 -> 00:51:05]  And I think he's going to study for one hour, but to make, put the things in order, he will
[00:51:05 -> 00:51:07]  make maybe two hours.
[00:51:07 -> 00:51:12]  Opposite to that, the other person, he's going to study, first he will take a book and throw
[00:51:12 -> 00:51:16]  it there, then throw another paper there, throw pencils there, then he will mess up
[00:51:16 -> 00:51:20]  with the bed, then he will start studying a little.
[00:51:20 -> 00:51:23]  You are getting it?
[00:51:23 -> 00:51:24]  Is it clear?
[00:51:24 -> 00:51:32]  These people are not having strong moral judgments on them and they don't have strong moral judgments
[00:51:32 -> 00:51:34]  on others.
[00:51:34 -> 00:51:35]  You are getting it?
[00:51:35 -> 00:51:39]  They are sort of relaxed, happy, good, lucky type of people.
[00:51:39 -> 00:51:45]  So your toilet training has to do a lot the way you behave today.
[00:51:45 -> 00:51:46]  Is that right?
[00:51:47 -> 00:51:53]  Now, after that, the next stage, okay, what is the fruit of this stage?
[00:51:53 -> 00:51:59]  If you resolve it positively, because baby mind is struggling with autonomy versus shame
[00:51:59 -> 00:52:01]  and doubt.
[00:52:01 -> 00:52:05]  If this is successfully resolved, what is the fruit of this stage?
[00:52:05 -> 00:52:07]  What is the reward?
[00:52:07 -> 00:52:10]  What is the strength to the baby personality?
[00:52:10 -> 00:52:17]  The baby will develop the willpower and determination, right?
[00:52:17 -> 00:52:21]  Baby will develop the willpower and determination.
[00:52:21 -> 00:52:26]  Do you think all of us have the same level of willpower and determination?
[00:52:26 -> 00:52:27]  No.
[00:52:27 -> 00:52:30]  All of you are given the same challenge today.
[00:52:30 -> 00:52:36]  Some of you will have strong willpower to resolve because it's not enough to have autonomy.
[00:52:36 -> 00:52:40]  Once you have autonomy, then you should have willpower.
[00:52:40 -> 00:52:41]  Is that right?
[00:52:41 -> 00:52:48]  So why many of us have different level of willpower and determination, it depends on
[00:52:48 -> 00:52:53]  how you were treated there, how you resolve this mental task.
[00:52:53 -> 00:53:01]  Now another thing, if you are developing positive traits on this side, upper stages become easy.
[00:53:01 -> 00:53:09]  For example, a baby who resolved it on the trust side and hope, the baby who developed
[00:53:09 -> 00:53:16]  the strength of hope in his personality, that baby find it easy to develop will and
[00:53:16 -> 00:53:22]  determination because such people who have the foundation of the hope in their personality,
[00:53:22 -> 00:53:27]  whenever they go into trouble, because they are hopeful, so they will work hard to come
[00:53:27 -> 00:53:30]  out of that situation.
[00:53:30 -> 00:53:34]  And with repeated experiences, they will know more we work hard, more better results they
[00:53:34 -> 00:53:39]  get in the practical life and their willpower and determination progressively become weaker
[00:53:39 -> 00:53:40]  or stronger?
[00:53:40 -> 00:53:41]  Stronger.
[00:53:41 -> 00:53:49]  But opposite to that, a person, unfortunately the foundation is wrong and he develop a personality
[00:53:49 -> 00:53:58]  which doesn't have much hope in stressful circumstances, do you think a person who cannot
[00:53:58 -> 00:54:04]  very easily become hopeless in troubles, can that person have strong willpower and determination?
[00:54:04 -> 00:54:05]  No.
[00:54:05 -> 00:54:12]  Because willpower and determination is based on hope.
[00:54:12 -> 00:54:16]  If you are hopeless about your studies, will you have determination to study?
[00:54:16 -> 00:54:17]  No.
[00:54:17 -> 00:54:20]  But if you are hopeful in spite of your bad grades, if you are hopeful, then you have
[00:54:20 -> 00:54:24]  determination to improve your scores and improve your grades.
[00:54:24 -> 00:54:26]  Is that clear?
[00:54:26 -> 00:54:29]  Now we go to the next stage.
[00:54:29 -> 00:54:37]  Here is fried situation, next stage of development and there is array correction.
[00:54:37 -> 00:54:44]  According to fried, the area of player shift to another area now, now maybe discover another
[00:54:44 -> 00:54:45]  area of player.
[00:54:45 -> 00:54:49]  Yes, Mr. Austak, what is that area now?
[00:54:49 -> 00:54:56]  Oh my god, he is obsessed with tongue, I don't know what's wrong with his development.
[00:54:57 -> 00:55:00]  There are other things to enjoy, my friend.
[00:55:00 -> 00:55:04]  You have enjoyed oral stage, you have had the player of the anal stage, now there is
[00:55:04 -> 00:55:06]  something other in your body to enjoy.
[00:55:06 -> 00:55:08]  Why don't you talk about your penis?
[00:55:08 -> 00:55:09]  Yes.
[00:55:09 -> 00:55:16]  Around this time, baby suddenly discover, why I am so obsessed with oral activity, let's
[00:55:16 -> 00:55:19]  enjoy the genitalia.
[00:55:19 -> 00:55:24]  Suddenly baby discover that by stimulating the genital area, there is a lot of player
[00:55:24 -> 00:55:27]  and you know whatever gives you player, you do it again and again.
[00:55:27 -> 00:55:30]  So babies are like you or maybe you are like babies.
[00:55:30 -> 00:55:38]  So what happened that we call this, fried called this stage phallic stage, phallic stage
[00:55:38 -> 00:55:41]  of personality development.
[00:55:41 -> 00:55:47]  I don't know why he was developing personality around such thing but anyway, he said that
[00:55:47 -> 00:55:54]  once you have gone successfully through oral stage and anal stage, baby's center of player
[00:55:54 -> 00:55:58]  will now shift to his or her genitalia.
[00:55:58 -> 00:56:00]  Is that right?
[00:56:00 -> 00:56:04]  Let me tell you, it's very important stage and you have to resolve it very carefully.
[00:56:04 -> 00:56:09]  Rather baby has to, child has to resolve.
[00:56:09 -> 00:56:13]  Do you think you want this stage to be discussed first or that stage?
[00:56:14 -> 00:56:21]  There, you know, here baby is busy with his special new center of happiness and there
[00:56:21 -> 00:56:27]  baby mind is busy in some other mental achievement to develop the personality, right?
[00:56:27 -> 00:56:40]  Now next challenge is in the baby, initiative versus guilt, initiative versus guilt and
[00:56:40 -> 00:56:46]  both stages are hand in hand.
[00:56:46 -> 00:56:52]  Now here first baby developed the hope in a positive way, then he developed will and
[00:56:52 -> 00:56:53]  determination.
[00:56:53 -> 00:56:57]  Baby was capable of trusting the world.
[00:56:57 -> 00:57:02]  He has also felt he has some autonomy that he can move around, he can grab the things,
[00:57:02 -> 00:57:03]  he can control his sphincter.
[00:57:03 -> 00:57:09]  If he is angry, he can pass it out something, right?
[00:57:09 -> 00:57:11]  Now he decides some initiative.
[00:57:11 -> 00:57:17]  By the time his mind is going to decide about initiative and guilt, his center of player
[00:57:17 -> 00:57:19]  comes around phallic stage.
[00:57:19 -> 00:57:24]  This is in boys and if I forget, remind me how the girls pass through this stage.
[00:57:24 -> 00:57:28]  Now around this time, what is the age of the baby now?
[00:57:28 -> 00:57:38]  That is preschooler, 3 to 6 years, 3 to 6 years of age during that time.
[00:57:38 -> 00:57:41]  Now personality will have new foundations.
[00:57:41 -> 00:57:45]  First of all look at this boy, then we will talk about girl.
[00:57:45 -> 00:57:50]  Around this time, boy discovers something very special that he has something like there
[00:57:50 -> 00:57:54]  which his mother is not having, is that right?
[00:57:54 -> 00:57:59]  They become aware of this thing that they are having a penis and with their certain
[00:57:59 -> 00:58:04]  experiences they come to know mother does not have penis, sisters do not have penis
[00:58:04 -> 00:58:09]  and somehow they develop that all the people around the baby, because his special interest
[00:58:09 -> 00:58:14]  is in phallic stage, penis, so start observing what is going on whenever chance is there
[00:58:14 -> 00:58:20]  and they do get some chances because females are not careful with these 3 year old, 4 year
[00:58:20 -> 00:58:21]  old.
[00:58:21 -> 00:58:29]  So baby, now this child discovers, male child, that boy, baby boy discovers that I am having
[00:58:29 -> 00:58:33]  a penis, my mother does not have and my father has.
[00:58:33 -> 00:58:37]  During this baby has seen some other activity in the home.
[00:58:37 -> 00:58:40]  At very early stage mother was everything, is that right?
[00:58:40 -> 00:58:45]  The significant relation was only mother, right?
[00:58:45 -> 00:58:51]  Then at this stage, autonomy versus shame and doubt stage, toddler stage, he knew that
[00:58:51 -> 00:58:57]  most important thing in the world are mother and father because baby start knowing that
[00:58:57 -> 00:59:01]  he is doing something, sometimes mother stops, sometimes father stops, but in early stage
[00:59:01 -> 00:59:05]  fathers are usually not playing any big role.
[00:59:05 -> 00:59:12]  At this stage they discover, baby boys, that we are having a penis and mother does not
[00:59:12 -> 00:59:15]  have and father has.
[00:59:15 -> 00:59:20]  Now they start resolving the mystery, why this difference is there, their small mind
[00:59:20 -> 00:59:23]  start working on this.
[00:59:23 -> 00:59:30]  Meanwhile another trouble starts, a big challenge and big crisis in their emotional life.
[00:59:30 -> 00:59:40]  That around this age, children start falling in love with the opposite sex parent.
[00:59:40 -> 00:59:47]  So small baby boys start falling in love with the mother, right?
[00:59:47 -> 00:59:54]  When they start falling in love with the mother, they get more close to the mother and they
[00:59:54 -> 00:59:59]  don't like their father to be around.
[00:59:59 -> 01:00:04]  If you really observe the boys in this age, 3 to 6, you will find that they want to keep
[01:00:04 -> 01:00:09]  the mother in a possessive fashion, they don't like father coming home, even they keep on
[01:00:09 -> 01:00:15]  suggesting to the mother, why don't you kick this man out, right?
[01:00:15 -> 01:00:19]  Usually mother is not going into that baby talk, they are wise, you know.
[01:00:19 -> 01:00:27]  So baby is now trying to take some initiative to the mother, he want sexually and romantically
[01:00:27 -> 01:00:32]  win the mother and grab it away from the father and repeatedly feeling father is coming
[01:00:32 -> 01:00:35]  in between.
[01:00:35 -> 01:00:40]  Meanwhile baby's small mind is also working up, why my mother does not have penis, my
[01:00:40 -> 01:00:44]  mother is my love object but why this thing is missing there?
[01:00:44 -> 01:00:51]  And unfortunately all baby boy reach to a very horrible conclusion, almost all of them
[01:00:51 -> 01:00:56]  somehow in their mind decide that this is culprit is father.
[01:00:56 -> 01:01:00]  Mother is all the time hard in the home, mother is afraid of him.
[01:01:00 -> 01:01:05]  I think my mother did some mistake and my father cut off the penis.
[01:01:05 -> 01:01:09]  Yeah this is a conclusion in almost all baby boys.
[01:01:09 -> 01:01:13]  Then they become afraid of father, because this is very valued thing, because baby boy
[01:01:13 -> 01:01:19]  is bringing all players from this area now and he is very afraid of father that he may
[01:01:19 -> 01:01:21]  cut off my penis also.
[01:01:21 -> 01:01:28]  Yeah that is true, that is called castration fear, the father will castrate the baby boy.
[01:01:28 -> 01:01:35]  Now he become more upset about the father and more loving to the mother, right all initiative
[01:01:35 -> 01:01:37]  is to love the mother.
[01:01:37 -> 01:01:44]  Now there is lot of tension, you just imagine small baby boy want to love the mother, very
[01:01:44 -> 01:01:50]  disturbed every time father come and their mother and child relationship disturbed.
[01:01:50 -> 01:01:53]  Of course when father come in the home, mother is less attentive to the baby, she has to
[01:01:53 -> 01:02:00]  attend that man also, who claim to be man of the house, baby feel this very bad and
[01:02:00 -> 01:02:04]  at the same time he is afraid that he may not bring something and cut it off.
[01:02:04 -> 01:02:12]  So baby is taking some initiative to the mother, he keep on suggesting that this man should
[01:02:12 -> 01:02:22]  be away and keep on fearing and developing guilt also, right that what he is doing.
[01:02:22 -> 01:02:27]  Meanwhile he take some other initiative because it is not enough to be autonomous, you should
[01:02:27 -> 01:02:33]  have some initiative to do certain things, right, certain plays.
[01:02:33 -> 01:02:40]  During this baby tries his best to displace the father, but most of the time they are
[01:02:40 -> 01:02:44]  not successful, you must be knowing, if mother kick the father out but reasons are different
[01:02:44 -> 01:02:48]  not baby boy suggested, right.
[01:02:48 -> 01:02:54]  So this baby boys around the age of 3 year and 6 year try their best to seduce the mother
[01:02:54 -> 01:03:01]  by their innocent ways and somehow get rid of the family from the father and in the end
[01:03:01 -> 01:03:07]  when they feel that their all seductive activity are not bringing any change in the equation
[01:03:07 -> 01:03:14]  of father and mother and fear of getting castrated day by day become more.
[01:03:14 -> 01:03:17]  So what happen, tension in their mind become very high.
[01:03:17 -> 01:03:25]  This mental crisis or emotional crisis in this baby is called Oedipus complex.
[01:03:25 -> 01:03:26]  You know Oedipus complex?
[01:03:26 -> 01:03:33]  This is Oedipus complex and baby has to resolve this.
[01:03:33 -> 01:03:40]  Baby boys eventually most of them decide all our special seductive effort to mother fail
[01:03:40 -> 01:03:43]  and there is no way to get this man out.
[01:03:43 -> 01:03:48]  Mental tension is too much due to fear of castration because baby is thinking all the
[01:03:48 -> 01:03:55]  time that I am planning to kick this man out and he may be also planning to cut it off.
[01:03:55 -> 01:04:01]  So eventually he decides this tension is too much and all with his effort he could not
[01:04:01 -> 01:04:02]  win the mother.
[01:04:02 -> 01:04:05]  So he thinks forget about it.
[01:04:05 -> 01:04:09]  This loving mother is not a good thing.
[01:04:09 -> 01:04:15]  So his mind represses that thought and push all that tension, fantasies and experiences
[01:04:15 -> 01:04:19]  into unconscious mind, buries it there, it's not good.
[01:04:19 -> 01:04:20]  Why?
[01:04:20 -> 01:04:21]  Because then baby will become free.
[01:04:21 -> 01:04:26]  The baby does not want to win the mother.
[01:04:26 -> 01:04:29]  His tension will go down that he is failing on the mother.
[01:04:29 -> 01:04:33]  Suddenly fear of castration will be also less.
[01:04:33 -> 01:04:35]  So Oedipus complex will be resolved.
[01:04:35 -> 01:04:39]  But baby's unconscious mind is so unhappy with this experience that it wants to forget
[01:04:39 -> 01:04:41]  about sexual things.
[01:04:41 -> 01:04:49]  And baby will go to next stage which is called sexual latency.
[01:04:49 -> 01:04:54]  Sexual urges will be latent, suppressed.
[01:04:54 -> 01:04:58]  During this phase another thing happens when he is shifting from this phase to that.
[01:04:58 -> 01:05:06]  Because baby boy in spite of all its effort could not win the romantic love of the mother
[01:05:06 -> 01:05:08]  and could not displace the father.
[01:05:08 -> 01:05:14]  So this baby boy decides that how he can win the mother.
[01:05:14 -> 01:05:18]  Then he comes to know mother is won by the father.
[01:05:18 -> 01:05:22]  It means I should be someone like the father.
[01:05:22 -> 01:05:23]  You are understanding?
[01:05:23 -> 01:05:28]  So baby will resolve this tension because father is the winner and I want to be the
[01:05:28 -> 01:05:31]  winner so I should be someone like father.
[01:05:31 -> 01:05:38]  Then suddenly these baby boys start taking father as an ideal.
[01:05:38 -> 01:05:40]  They start dressing like father.
[01:05:40 -> 01:05:42]  They start behaving like father.
[01:05:42 -> 01:05:46]  And even when father is not in the home, they behave with the mother like father.
[01:05:46 -> 01:05:52]  They sit on the father chair, put a newspaper like this and call Karen, Karen can you come
[01:05:52 -> 01:05:55]  here with cup of tea?
[01:05:55 -> 01:05:59]  They are trying to behave like father and that is very important for the development
[01:05:59 -> 01:06:01]  of the baby.
[01:06:01 -> 01:06:03]  Why?
[01:06:03 -> 01:06:11]  Because this is the time when baby boys decide that they should be manly.
[01:06:11 -> 01:06:12]  Is that right?
[01:06:12 -> 01:06:13]  But they should not love their own mother.
[01:06:13 -> 01:06:19]  When they will grow up they should look for some other heterosexual experiences.
[01:06:19 -> 01:06:20]  You are understanding?
[01:06:20 -> 01:06:24]  So this is very important to resolve this stage successfully.
[01:06:24 -> 01:06:26]  Is that right?
[01:06:26 -> 01:06:33]  So baby boys pass through adipose complex and baby girls pass through electra complex.
[01:06:33 -> 01:06:41]  In electra complex what happen that they say baby girls also fall in love with the opposite
[01:06:41 -> 01:06:44]  gender parent that is with father.
[01:06:44 -> 01:06:49]  But their troubles are not as dramatic as baby boys because they already don't have
[01:06:49 -> 01:06:50]  penis.
[01:06:50 -> 01:06:52]  Is that right?
[01:06:52 -> 01:06:55]  So they are not fearing anything castration.
[01:06:55 -> 01:07:01]  Secondly they try to win the father and of course they cannot win the father.
[01:07:01 -> 01:07:07]  So they observe that who is winning the father.
[01:07:07 -> 01:07:10]  Baby girls decide fine mother is winning the father all the time.
[01:07:10 -> 01:07:14]  So I should behave like mother.
[01:07:14 -> 01:07:20]  So they idealize their mother and they start behaving emotionally and socially like feminine
[01:07:20 -> 01:07:23]  behavior.
[01:07:23 -> 01:07:24]  Is that clear?
[01:07:24 -> 01:07:28]  So in females babies this complex is resolved easily.
[01:07:28 -> 01:07:33]  But for male baby this is a very difficult step to pass through.
[01:07:33 -> 01:07:34]  Is that right?
[01:07:34 -> 01:07:41]  Now we were talking about initiative and guilt.
[01:07:41 -> 01:07:46]  Now in initiative and guilt baby has to take certain initiative in this age because he
[01:07:46 -> 01:07:49]  has found some autonomy in previous stage.
[01:07:49 -> 01:07:52]  He has willpower and determination to do certain things.
[01:07:52 -> 01:07:57]  For example baby may start taking small initiative.
[01:07:57 -> 01:08:02]  Parents may buy the small cars and they behave as if they are driving the car themselves.
[01:08:02 -> 01:08:06]  Baby girls start with the mother they try to help in cooking somewhat.
[01:08:06 -> 01:08:13]  They start taking some initiatives and sometimes they do mistake and then they feel guilty.
[01:08:13 -> 01:08:19]  Let me tell you the same activity at this stage and that stage means different.
[01:08:19 -> 01:08:20]  I will give you an example.
[01:08:20 -> 01:08:25]  If you imagine that there is two year old baby boy.
[01:08:25 -> 01:08:36]  He takes his father's wrist watch and happily put in the toilet drain and flush it and watch
[01:08:36 -> 01:08:38]  goes down.
[01:08:38 -> 01:08:45]  Now for baby if you are sensible father do you think baby, two year old baby who has
[01:08:45 -> 01:08:52]  put your watch into toilet and flushed it out, he had some evil intentions?
[01:08:52 -> 01:08:53]  No.
[01:08:53 -> 01:08:54]  For that baby what was that?
[01:08:54 -> 01:08:58]  That was something shining going round and round and then going down.
[01:08:58 -> 01:08:59]  And he enjoyed it.
[01:08:59 -> 01:09:00]  Is that right?
[01:09:00 -> 01:09:07]  He took a special autonomy, it was his decision, autonomous decision to flush the, is it right?
[01:09:07 -> 01:09:08]  Fine.
[01:09:08 -> 01:09:13]  But if he is taking the watch and you grab it away he feels shame and doubt.
[01:09:13 -> 01:09:20]  But if you grab it away it is good but if after that you beat him he will lose you know
[01:09:20 -> 01:09:23]  confidence in his capabilities.
[01:09:23 -> 01:09:31]  Now you imagine but if five year old child he takes father's watch put in the flush and
[01:09:31 -> 01:09:32]  flush it.
[01:09:32 -> 01:09:39]  Do you think this baby has taken initiative but it is a wrong initiative?
[01:09:39 -> 01:09:45]  This baby is supposed to know that this shiny thing, this father's watch if it is put in
[01:09:45 -> 01:09:51]  the flush and it is flushed this baby should know what will happen to watch and this baby
[01:09:51 -> 01:09:59]  should also know what will happen to daddy's temper and baby should feel guilty.
[01:09:59 -> 01:10:03]  So same event at this stage is manifestation of autonomy.
[01:10:03 -> 01:10:05]  Here this will end up into guilt.
[01:10:05 -> 01:10:11]  But do you expect two year old boy to be guilty of his flushing the watch?
[01:10:11 -> 01:10:16]  It is round round going down shiny but here it should be guilty.
[01:10:16 -> 01:10:21]  So what happens that here babies take initiative and when they make terrible mistakes they
[01:10:21 -> 01:10:27]  should feel guilty and personality should have a balance in both things.
[01:10:27 -> 01:10:34]  The healthy personality develops when initiative is strong with little touch of guilt.
[01:10:34 -> 01:10:39]  Because if you have only initiative and no guilt that is abnormality.
[01:10:39 -> 01:10:43]  And during this stage if parents make you for everything you do you are made to feel
[01:10:43 -> 01:10:47]  guilty again personality is defective.
[01:10:47 -> 01:10:51]  This is the balance of the two which will bring the new strength to your personality.
[01:10:51 -> 01:10:57]  If you really successfully mentally resolve this stage in which there is mental conflict
[01:10:57 -> 01:11:06]  between initiative and guilt then the reward of this stage is purpose.
[01:11:06 -> 01:11:09]  You know you should have initiative with purpose.
[01:11:10 -> 01:11:16]  There is no purpose in flushing the watch and it should not be done by this baby.
[01:11:16 -> 01:11:17]  You are understanding?
[01:11:17 -> 01:11:23]  Now baby who is developing person who is developing on the positive side in first year of life
[01:11:23 -> 01:11:27]  he developed to be the strength of hope.
[01:11:27 -> 01:11:31]  Then during autonomy he learned willpower and determination and during initiative versus
[01:11:31 -> 01:11:36]  guilt baby developed that whatever initiative should be taken it should be taken with a
[01:11:36 -> 01:11:39]  purpose and courage.
[01:11:39 -> 01:11:45]  So these are the positive strengths which you are developing in your personality.
[01:11:45 -> 01:11:51]  If you are developing on this side you are developing very sad type of personality weak
[01:11:51 -> 01:11:56]  type of personality you don't trust people with little problems you become hopeless on
[01:11:56 -> 01:11:57]  this side.
[01:11:57 -> 01:12:05]  You are always not sure you are doubtful about your capabilities.
[01:12:05 -> 01:12:09]  And you are not willing to take initiative because whatever initiative you took in your
[01:12:09 -> 01:12:13]  childhood you felt guilty.
[01:12:13 -> 01:12:16]  So this will be strong personality or weak personality on this side?
[01:12:16 -> 01:12:17]  Weak personality.
[01:12:17 -> 01:12:18]  Is that right?
[01:12:18 -> 01:12:21]  No problem up to this?
[01:12:21 -> 01:12:31]  And another thing I want to tell that if autonomy is pathologically too much if parents make
[01:12:31 -> 01:12:36]  you too much autonomous in early life that is also dangerous.
[01:12:36 -> 01:12:42]  People who are made autonomous too much at early stage when they grow up they develop
[01:12:42 -> 01:12:49]  a problem and problem is impulsivity they become impulsive.
[01:12:49 -> 01:12:52]  You know what is impulsivity?
[01:12:52 -> 01:12:58]  That without thinking of your capabilities and without thinking of consequences in an
[01:12:58 -> 01:13:06]  impulsive fashion you jump into new situations because you wrongly feel too much autonomous.
[01:13:06 -> 01:13:07]  Is that right?
[01:13:07 -> 01:13:15]  And if you go to that side too much shame and doubt then you will because toilet training
[01:13:15 -> 01:13:21]  was done and parents were very hard on you you are all the time feeling shame and doubt
[01:13:21 -> 01:13:26]  about your capabilities to control your sphincters and other activity then this is the first
[01:13:26 -> 01:13:31]  baby you know first baby harshly trained they develop compulsivity.
[01:13:31 -> 01:13:43]  Compulsivity is like obsessive compulsive neurosis that you want everything to be perfect
[01:13:43 -> 01:13:49]  before you do anything otherwise you all the time have doubts about the situations.
[01:13:49 -> 01:13:55]  Then we come here if you have too much initiative if this ingredient of personality is pathologically
[01:13:55 -> 01:13:57]  too much you develop another problem.
[01:13:57 -> 01:14:00]  You know what is the problem here in your personality?
[01:14:00 -> 01:14:01]  Ruthlessness.
[01:14:01 -> 01:14:06]  I will explain how ruthlessness.
[01:14:06 -> 01:14:12]  If you are given at this stage between 3 to 6 years too much initiative without any guilt
[01:14:12 -> 01:14:21]  when you develop as a person adult you take initiative for your goals but in ruthless
[01:14:21 -> 01:14:25]  fashion because you don't feel guilty and when you are achieving your goal you don't
[01:14:25 -> 01:14:29]  care what happens to others you step on their head or you step on their chest you don't
[01:14:29 -> 01:14:34]  care what happens to others you want to achieve your goal that is the problem when you are
[01:14:34 -> 01:14:40]  given too much initiative without guilt you become ruthless.
[01:14:40 -> 01:14:46]  But if this ingredient is over too much then you have another trouble and that trouble
[01:14:46 -> 01:14:53]  is severe inhibition and too much inhibition in everything you are not going to take any
[01:14:53 -> 01:14:56]  initiative in the life have you seen some people who don't want to make any decision
[01:14:56 -> 01:15:02]  for themselves they want others to make their decision they don't want to do any venture
[01:15:03 -> 01:15:08]  they say nothing ventured nothing lost what is happening with them they are inhibited
[01:15:09 -> 01:15:19]  and even this may end up in males with impotence and females in frigidity right so this there
[01:15:19 -> 01:15:26]  should be always a beautiful balance in between the two a little more towards positive side
[01:15:26 -> 01:15:32]  that you should develop a personality with strong initiative with touch of guilt this is very
[01:15:32 -> 01:15:37]  important the touch of guilt because if you don't develop the touch of guilt your parents just tell
[01:15:37 -> 01:15:41]  you whatever you want to do and you are having full initiative for everything and full support
[01:15:41 -> 01:15:48]  what happens you become a selfish adult you don't care what happens to others while you are going
[01:15:48 -> 01:15:56]  for your own goals is that right anyway now this person who has developed balance in all these
[01:15:56 -> 01:16:02]  things he's a hopeful person and whenever trouble is there he will still keep the hope he will
[01:16:02 -> 01:16:08]  exercise will and determination and all his activity will be with the purpose and courage
[01:16:09 -> 01:16:15]  is that right then baby will move to the next six year to 12 year of age
[01:16:16 -> 01:16:22]  six year to from six year onwards six to 12 years of age now his social circle is widening
[01:16:23 -> 01:16:29]  as you know initially it was only mother then mother and father then in next stage family
[01:16:30 -> 01:16:38]  which are the important significant people is that right now school and neighborhood
[01:16:39 -> 01:16:44]  now baby has gone beyond the family and he's somewhere between 6 and 12 years of old
[01:16:44 -> 01:16:50]  the best thing is that sexually he has gone into latency at this stage usually boys like to play
[01:16:50 -> 01:17:01]  with boys and girls like to play with girls is that right and boys are idealizing their fathers
[01:17:01 -> 01:17:07]  and girls are idealizing their mothers because they suffer too much at this stage you know
[01:17:07 -> 01:17:13]  phallic stage now at this stage there's a new challenge they are going to school there's a
[01:17:13 -> 01:17:22]  pressure to learn new skills academic skills athletic skills or music there are new challenges
[01:17:22 -> 01:17:29]  to learn new things right now let's suppose there's one baby one child who is positively
[01:17:29 -> 01:17:35]  developing he goes to school now parent game has gone beyond the parents and family now school
[01:17:36 -> 01:17:44]  teachers are also significant figures baby has to perform there's a challenge between two tasks
[01:17:44 -> 01:17:51]  number one is industry industry hard work industry versus inferiority
[01:17:55 -> 01:17:58]  now let me tell you what is meant by this now new mental task has come
[01:17:58 -> 01:18:04]  industry versus inferiority if child will perform well in the school or in the games
[01:18:04 -> 01:18:11]  on other tasks which society is pushing the child to learn if he'll perform well he will feel I'm
[01:18:11 -> 01:18:17]  I'm not inferior he's comparing his performance as compared to others performance or with certain
[01:18:17 -> 01:18:24]  standards and he will feel I'm not inferior and when he feel better he work hard to learn new
[01:18:24 -> 01:18:32]  hard to learn new skills and new competences and we say the child is becoming industrious
[01:18:33 -> 01:18:38]  which child will more easily go to positive side now look at the foundation
[01:18:39 -> 01:18:45]  those children who go to the school but if they have the strength of hope will and determination
[01:18:45 -> 01:18:51]  purpose they will become more industrious it means if your foundations are better you can
[01:18:51 -> 01:18:58]  resolve at later stages of life easily on the positive side for example when this baby is
[01:18:58 -> 01:19:06]  asked to learn mathematics or suppose any foreign language right or let's suppose he has to learn
[01:19:06 -> 01:19:11]  science you know what happens this is a new thing for baby he has to develop a new skill
[01:19:12 -> 01:19:15]  when baby start reading the books and taking less lessons from the parents
[01:19:16 -> 01:19:22]  he feel frustrated because it's new but if he has hope if he has willpower if he has a purpose
[01:19:22 -> 01:19:28]  he will strongly come up with positive outcome but if baby has sad things here do you think he
[01:19:28 -> 01:19:34]  will have hope that he will succeed in learning new skills even if he's learning in a bad way
[01:19:34 -> 01:19:41]  will he exercise willpower and determination will he plan his time purposefully to achieve something
[01:19:41 -> 01:19:46]  no so what i'm trying to say that if already foundations are weak
[01:19:48 -> 01:19:52]  the outcomes at higher level of personality development are more chances it will go to the
[01:19:52 -> 01:20:00]  weak side or if foundations are strong you will also develop more strengths on the higher level
[01:20:00 -> 01:20:07]  of personality development let's suppose baby has balanced out these in a positive way and resolved
[01:20:07 -> 01:20:12]  this complete conflict in a very good way and maybe a child learns in the school that yes it's
[01:20:12 -> 01:20:18]  good to be industrious it's good to learn right and it is not good to feel inferior i'm as strong
[01:20:19 -> 01:20:25]  as i should be right whatever performance he is giving he feels it is good parents are appreciating
[01:20:25 -> 01:20:30]  teachers are appreciating grades are becoming good right and he will resolve on this side
[01:20:30 -> 01:20:35]  his personality will develop one more strength and what is that strength that strength and
[01:20:35 -> 01:20:43]  personality is skill and competence now all these strengths will help him in as adult
[01:20:45 -> 01:20:49]  if you have resolved positively in school time skills and competencies and you have developed
[01:20:49 -> 01:20:56]  a confidence that when you want to learn new thing you can this person will be very strong
[01:20:57 -> 01:21:02]  as an adult that let's suppose there's one person who is developing on this side another person
[01:21:02 -> 01:21:07]  developing on that side just imagine both of them are 40 year old and both of them going to
[01:21:07 -> 01:21:14]  severe financial reverses who will come out this one because he has a lot of financial losses both
[01:21:14 -> 01:21:21]  of them but he will be still hopeful so keep on trying keep on working even though outward
[01:21:21 -> 01:21:26]  circumstances are depressing but his willpower and determination to come out of the bad situation
[01:21:26 -> 01:21:34]  will be strong then all his effort with the purpose to come out of financial trouble and
[01:21:34 -> 01:21:39]  whatever new skills he has to learn he has confidence to learn the new skill to come out
[01:21:39 -> 01:21:45]  of that trouble but person who is at the age of 40 suppose where he loses the hope at the
[01:21:45 -> 01:21:51]  financial tragedy he does not have any willpower and determination he cannot live in a purposeful
[01:21:51 -> 01:21:57]  fashion and he thinks he cannot acquire the skills to learn new business to come out of his
[01:21:57 -> 01:22:05]  trouble he will stick with his problems are you understanding fine let's suppose child has learned
[01:22:05 -> 01:22:12]  this stage also positively and he got a reward of skill and competencies now baby will go to the
[01:22:12 -> 01:22:18]  next stage at this stage the last stage will develop of the what is this
[01:22:20 -> 01:22:28]  fried fried says that now baby is entering about 13th year to 18th year so what is this puberty
[01:22:29 -> 01:22:38]  that will become puberty at puberty there is sudden you know awakening of what sexual interest
[01:22:39 -> 01:22:43]  suddenly baby again goes back to his own genitalia rather more interested in others
[01:22:43 -> 01:22:50]  genitalia also you all of you have passed through that stage isn't it now there is reawakening of
[01:22:51 -> 01:22:55]  sexual interest this is called by fried genital stage
[01:22:57 -> 01:23:04]  genital stage right that is at the time of puberty and up to few more years genital stage
[01:23:05 -> 01:23:09]  if now according to fried if you are resolved these things positively
[01:23:09 -> 01:23:12]  baby will take interest in opposite sex
[01:23:14 -> 01:23:21]  because boys have resolved the oedipus complex and they learn to be like men and love women
[01:23:22 -> 01:23:27]  but not their own mother in that way girls are also learned at early stage
[01:23:28 -> 01:23:33]  that it's not good to fall in love with the father it's better to be mother like but find
[01:23:33 -> 01:23:39]  someone else so this is a genital stage according to the fried and fried stopped personality
[01:23:39 -> 01:23:46]  development here this was the eric rickson he kept on developing personality until your last breath
[01:23:47 -> 01:23:55]  right and actually eric rickson was he always claimed that he learned most of psychology from
[01:23:56 -> 01:24:03]  the theories of fried but actually eric rickson came in psychology after fried
[01:24:03 -> 01:24:13]  fried died in 19 late 1930s and eric rickson died in 1994 few years back he he developed
[01:24:13 -> 01:24:20]  advanced stages so eric rickson say and this is the most important stage eric rickson says that
[01:24:20 -> 01:24:27]  when you pass 12 to 18 years old the most important stage of your life come a big mental
[01:24:27 -> 01:24:36]  task to do right what is that again there's a challenge there are two mental forces and you
[01:24:36 -> 01:24:43]  have to resolve in between them those mental forces are that you have to decide between
[01:24:44 -> 01:24:53]  identity identity versus role confusion role confusion what is it
[01:24:56 -> 01:25:00]  when human beings are somewhere around age of 13 to 18 or 13 to 20
[01:25:02 -> 01:25:10]  the major mental task is to make a clear-cut identity identity mean that around this age
[01:25:10 -> 01:25:18]  adolescent start thinking who are they let me tell you here let's come back to this question
[01:25:19 -> 01:25:28]  you know three month old baby what he thinks three month old baby thinks he and mother is one person
[01:25:28 -> 01:25:33]  even they don't know mother is different thing they feel so intimate with the mother is that right
[01:25:34 -> 01:25:45]  but as they grow up they learn we are the son of this mother and father at this stage they learn
[01:25:45 -> 01:25:54]  we belong to that family at this stage they say we belong to i'm a good son i'm a good family member
[01:25:54 -> 01:26:01]  and i'm a good school member i'm someone asked in school where you are it is his identity that
[01:26:01 -> 01:26:07]  he is eighth grader or whatever but when baby come here suddenly he discover a new thing
[01:26:08 -> 01:26:12]  he says fine my mother is my mother but i'm different than mother my father is my father
[01:26:12 -> 01:26:17]  but i have my own uniqueness fine i belong to a family but still i have own uniqueness
[01:26:17 -> 01:26:24]  i have many friends in school but i i'm different than still unique there a question come who am i
[01:26:26 -> 01:26:28]  what is my place in the adult world
[01:26:29 -> 01:26:36]  now he start asking baby himself what is his role in the practical adult world
[01:26:36 -> 01:26:40]  adolescent this is a big pressure to the adolescent to decide this thing
[01:26:41 -> 01:26:47]  so they start the special venture in search of identity they want to know are they doctors
[01:26:47 -> 01:26:52]  are going to be doctor or they are going to be engineer or they are going to be very religious
[01:26:52 -> 01:26:59]  or they are going to be atheist or they are going to be good who they are what is their
[01:26:59 -> 01:27:04]  place in the practical world this is a major question so they start thinking about their
[01:27:04 -> 01:27:11]  identity in search of identity they do many things which disturb the elders for example
[01:27:11 -> 01:27:17]  suddenly they like pop music suddenly they start going to the church and too much suddenly they
[01:27:18 -> 01:27:26]  suddenly they shift and they decide no only and they should be great doctors what is happening
[01:27:26 -> 01:27:33]  at this time adolescents start looking around themselves and in the media a role model
[01:27:34 -> 01:27:42]  they're looking for a role model because for them here the most important most important opinion is
[01:27:42 -> 01:27:51]  peer pressure here father looks somewhat stupid yes suddenly they come to know the mother is not
[01:27:51 -> 01:27:56]  as strong as they thought and father is not as wise as they thought they think their friends
[01:27:56 -> 01:28:01]  are more wise because they know about some special music group which father doesn't know
[01:28:01 -> 01:28:08]  so father should be stupid and they should be wise is that right now around this age
[01:28:08 -> 01:28:14]  they're looking for identity for example if they have some in the media on the television they are
[01:28:14 -> 01:28:20]  seeing some special pop show again and again they say we should be like that or they think
[01:28:20 -> 01:28:25]  you are showing them war heroes they say okay we must go to the military or they see they see there
[01:28:25 -> 01:28:32]  that there is a very special type of girl see a special model very successful lot of money
[01:28:32 -> 01:28:37]  lot of cameras after she should be like that or they see there's some uncle who is a very good
[01:28:37 -> 01:28:43]  neurosurgeon okay we should be like that now they start actively looking for the role model
[01:28:43 -> 01:28:50]  is that right and they have to decide in their own mind what is their identity so this is the time to
[01:28:50 -> 01:28:59]  look for identity if you pass successfully through this stage then you will commit yourself with one
[01:28:59 -> 01:29:05]  specific identity you decide to be a doctor then you start taking the practical steps that as a
[01:29:05 -> 01:29:11]  doctor how you should study which universities you should plan to go how the doctor's life is
[01:29:11 -> 01:29:18]  there you are devoting your mental energy to a specific identity another friend he resolved
[01:29:18 -> 01:29:23]  and decide I should be a military person so he will start taking interest to that side
[01:29:23 -> 01:29:28]  but before they reach to final identity they do something so much switching
[01:29:28 -> 01:29:36]  as a temporary identities they acquire and that is the time where elders have to handle them
[01:29:36 -> 01:29:43]  with a lot of tact because in child mind adolescent mind elders have lost their authority
[01:29:44 -> 01:29:51]  because they are not so wise son will look to the father oh father you have only three million
[01:29:51 -> 01:29:56]  dollars you are not billionaire you never thought to be billionaire you sound stupid
[01:29:57 -> 01:30:05]  yeah or girl may look to the mother oh you cannot manage my father look at me I can get five men
[01:30:05 -> 01:30:12]  after me like this you cannot manage your own husband she's a stupid woman right so somehow
[01:30:12 -> 01:30:20]  adolescent have lost the real influence of the elders and more influences by the peer group
[01:30:20 -> 01:30:26]  peer group so elders are just like powerless but still they have due to their experience
[01:30:26 -> 01:30:34]  they have to be very tactful to push the babies to positive identity because sometimes
[01:30:34 -> 01:30:39]  during identity search children or adolescent may go to negative identity
[01:30:41 -> 01:30:47]  and they may become fanatic they become they may join some very narrow-minded religious group
[01:30:47 -> 01:30:55]  just in search of they want to be something or they may join some mob in search of identity
[01:30:55 -> 01:31:02]  that we belong to this mob right they may acquire negative identity or positive identity or worst
[01:31:02 -> 01:31:10]  they may not have any identity they have role confusion so all of us when we are passing
[01:31:10 -> 01:31:18]  through adolescent the main mental energy is used in search of identity and elders and media role
[01:31:18 -> 01:31:25]  elders role is that take the adolescents towards positive identities because if they go to the
[01:31:25 -> 01:31:30]  negative identity they will make their trouble for society and if they don't have any identity
[01:31:30 -> 01:31:36]  still they will have trouble for themselves at least because person who does not have identity
[01:31:36 -> 01:31:42]  clear cut he is not well devoted to any final decision in his life what will happen to that
[01:31:42 -> 01:31:47]  person he will keep on changing his roles and professions and situations one day you may find
[01:31:47 -> 01:31:53]  a role confusing person in the age of 35 suddenly he changes religion okay everyone has a right to
[01:31:53 -> 01:31:57]  change religion if you want to but in the age of 37 you find he has gone to another religion
[01:31:57 -> 01:32:04]  in the age of 40 you decide i don't have any religion he's confused is that right you have to
[01:32:04 -> 01:32:11]  have a clear identity around the stage then life will become easier right you have to know who you
[01:32:11 -> 01:32:18]  are in this universe what you are going to be in the adult world is that right now you imagine
[01:32:19 -> 01:32:25]  look at the situation let's suppose there's a neurosurgeon in the family and there are two
[01:32:25 -> 01:32:31]  boys both of them are 16 year old now both of them decide in their mind okay it's great to be
[01:32:31 -> 01:32:36]  neurosurgeon rather he our uncle is stupid is neurosurgeon it's more wise to be cardiac surgeon
[01:32:36 -> 01:32:42]  rather very wise to be plastic surgeon now they start dreaming about the identity of suppose
[01:32:42 -> 01:32:49]  cardiac surgeon now when they start thinking about they look for the choices
[01:32:51 -> 01:32:59]  if they they find it takes many years it takes many much effort right so what happens the person
[01:32:59 -> 01:33:04]  who has these strength if he really want to be a cardiac surgeon he will commit to that
[01:33:05 -> 01:33:11]  for another cousin he said no i don't want to be cardiac surgeon i don't want to be such committed
[01:33:11 -> 01:33:17]  life in a profession i want to fly in the world i want to enjoy the spices of life and i want to
[01:33:17 -> 01:33:22]  have a lot of money he decides to be a big businessman he want to be a billionaire now
[01:33:22 -> 01:33:29]  his identity is like trump like bill gates but again that is an identity so he start thinking
[01:33:29 -> 01:33:37]  about that but he will stick to billionaire's plan if he has hope but not only you have to be hopeful
[01:33:37 -> 01:33:41]  to be a billionaire or extremely successful you have to have willpower and determination
[01:33:42 -> 01:33:48]  then you according to that purpose you align your life activity and then you should develop
[01:33:48 -> 01:33:53]  all the skills and competences required to achieve that big thing either it is big cardiac
[01:33:53 -> 01:34:00]  surgeon or big businessman is that right if you have all these things positive you will stick with
[01:34:00 -> 01:34:07]  your ideal right and you will be devoted you will be loyal with something and we say the fruit of
[01:34:07 -> 01:34:17]  the stage will be loyalty or we call it devotion the this is a capacity of devotion everyone does
[01:34:17 -> 01:34:26]  not have capacity to be devoted to certain way of life devotion opposite to that same family
[01:34:27 -> 01:34:32]  one uncle is cardiac surgeon other is a big businessman but unfortunately one child was
[01:34:32 -> 01:34:37]  raised with negative experiences he wants to be a billionaire but very soon he become hopeless
[01:34:37 -> 01:34:44]  when he look at that there are only few billionaire in the world even he for few months and years he
[01:34:44 -> 01:34:50]  think to be billionaire but his willpower and determination is not there he cannot he wants to
[01:34:50 -> 01:34:55]  be big cardiac surgeon or billionaire but he cannot adjust his lifestyle with that purpose
[01:34:56 -> 01:35:01]  and he is not willing to acquire skills and competences do you think he will be well devoted
[01:35:01 -> 01:35:09]  to his ideal no you are understanding how our early care is putting the foundations for our
[01:35:09 -> 01:35:20]  adult life so the reward of resolving the conflict of identity versus role confusion is
[01:35:20 -> 01:35:25]  loyalty and devotion you are committed to your own self and your adult place
[01:35:25 -> 01:35:32]  and you are willing to bring all these resources for that future plan right during this
[01:35:33 -> 01:35:39]  you know adolescence make couples do you think they are really long lasting or short lasting
[01:35:40 -> 01:35:47]  they short lasting why because that is not for love sometime a girl get attached 15 year old
[01:35:47 -> 01:35:52]  girl attached with a male only to find an identity that I am girlfriend of Vyagane
[01:35:53 -> 01:36:00]  that's it her identity or one boy is looking for identity okay he just likes a girl very much
[01:36:00 -> 01:36:06]  so that he gets a new identity that I am a boyfriend of this girl due to these reasons
[01:36:06 -> 01:36:10]  because they are trying different identity even relationships are not very committed
[01:36:10 -> 01:36:19]  in the with the opposite gender but as soon as they cross 18 around that very big new challenge come
[01:36:21 -> 01:36:28]  you know what is that challenge suddenly they feel they have answered many thing look here
[01:36:28 -> 01:36:35]  the answer was come back the main big question here was is the world trustworthy or not here
[01:36:35 -> 01:36:41]  the real was am I independent enough or not here the question was can I take initiatives or not
[01:36:41 -> 01:36:48]  here can I develop the competencies or not here who am I you know what is the question here I am
[01:36:48 -> 01:36:55]  so alone suddenly they come to know mother is mother father is father family is family school
[01:36:55 -> 01:37:01]  is school but I am alone these children don't feel alone they are very happy with mother and
[01:37:01 -> 01:37:10]  father only but they feel alone right now their mental life is stuck into another challenge
[01:37:10 -> 01:37:17]  the challenge is intimacy versus isolation
[01:37:18 -> 01:37:25]  what is intimacy developing closeness to another human being with all your trust
[01:37:25 -> 01:37:31]  surrendering your autonomy to some degree taking initiative for yourself and other person
[01:37:31 -> 01:37:37]  developing the competencies to make your life easy and other person's life easy
[01:37:37 -> 01:37:44]  and having the capability not to be only devoted to your own professional goal but also to other
[01:37:44 -> 01:37:49]  professional goal but also to other person's the capability of loyalty many people are not
[01:37:49 -> 01:37:56]  capable of that right now if you're positively developed you will resolve to intimacy
[01:37:57 -> 01:38:04]  you will decide that in spite of many troubles in new relations it's worth it let me give you
[01:38:04 -> 01:38:11]  an example let's suppose in your class there is a girl who's very positive minded and unfortunately
[01:38:12 -> 01:38:19]  she gets a boyfriend who's negatively developing now girl who is very positive minded what she
[01:38:19 -> 01:38:24]  will do she is in a big test in relationship but if she has developed in positive way
[01:38:24 -> 01:38:27]  then boyfriend is not behaving in a good way she will be still hopeful
[01:38:28 -> 01:38:36]  she will have a true willpower to change him according to her wishes right she will work on
[01:38:36 -> 01:38:44]  that purpose she will develop new skills to tame that boyfriend and even when boyfriend is fooling
[01:38:44 -> 01:38:49]  around she will remain loyal and one day boyfriend will say oh my girlfriend really loves me
[01:38:50 -> 01:38:53]  is that right but if she's developed in negative way
[01:38:56 -> 01:39:01]  when boyfriend become a little bit less interested in her she will become hopeless
[01:39:01 -> 01:39:05]  she will not have will and determination to continue the relationship in spite of some
[01:39:05 -> 01:39:11]  trouble she will never work with a special purpose how to improve this particular relationship
[01:39:11 -> 01:39:15]  she is not interested to develop new skills for this particular relationship
[01:39:15 -> 01:39:23]  and she will also become disloyal do you think that love can go far no so all these things will
[01:39:23 -> 01:39:31]  now determine that either your mind will decide your emotional circuits in your mind will decide
[01:39:31 -> 01:39:38]  that intimacy is worth it in spite of all problem or if you are a person who are unfortunately weaker
[01:39:38 -> 01:39:43]  in personality with little little trouble in intimate relation you will say this is a hopeless
[01:39:43 -> 01:39:50]  situation I cannot win over there and you start getting isolated so it means that if the person
[01:39:50 -> 01:39:55]  who is positively developing he has a stronger capacity of intimacy the person who is negatively
[01:39:55 -> 01:40:02]  developing he has weaker capacity for intimacy so he will eventually like to be emotionally
[01:40:02 -> 01:40:08]  isolated is that right he may have girlfriend this person who is isolated but he will not
[01:40:08 -> 01:40:14]  emotionally share with her he will not trust her and girlfriend will know that he is not trusting
[01:40:14 -> 01:40:21]  me do you think relationship will go ahead it won't am I clear if you develop this positive
[01:40:21 -> 01:40:27]  what is the reward of this stage Mr. Vyagni will tell me you are quite an experienced man
[01:40:28 -> 01:40:34]  if you work through this stage in a very positive way what is the reward the strength in your
[01:40:34 -> 01:40:43]  personality what is that love that is this you become a loving person
[01:40:44 -> 01:40:48]  you know who is a loving person that even in bad circumstances
[01:40:48 -> 01:40:54]  when he loves he really loves when things in the loving relationships are going bad they remain
[01:40:54 -> 01:41:01]  hopeful if there is crisis they will have still will and determination not run away and break
[01:41:01 -> 01:41:05]  away from relationship and they will specially work on that and in very bad times they will
[01:41:05 -> 01:41:12]  remain loyal they truly love other person is that right so they will become loving people
[01:41:13 -> 01:41:22]  loving personality is that right so and okay there is an interesting thing I must tell you
[01:41:22 -> 01:41:29]  that Eric Rickson gave one concept of ideal love I always feel that he call it
[01:41:31 -> 01:41:38]  genital utopia you know love is basically opposite gender love this is actually an effort
[01:41:38 -> 01:41:46]  yes it is an effort to expand yourself in this universe because you want to be with someone
[01:41:46 -> 01:41:52]  you want to share your life you want to trust and you want to recreate and procreate is that right
[01:41:52 -> 01:41:57]  you want to have children when you truly love someone so what really happens there is very
[01:41:57 -> 01:42:04]  interesting thing which Eric Rickson said about love he say the whole purpose of love is
[01:42:04 -> 01:42:09]  he has given six criteria for that and I feel some females have written this statement
[01:42:09 -> 01:42:16]  he has said that true love should have number one mutuality of orgasm both of them seek that
[01:42:16 -> 01:42:23]  other person should have orgasm also not like that men just ejaculate and sleep turn the side and
[01:42:23 -> 01:42:29]  sleep and she is wondering why I'm here right so number one mutuality of orgasm
[01:42:30 -> 01:42:34]  criteria number two mutuality of orgasm number two with a loved partner
[01:42:36 -> 01:42:43]  with a not with anyone around from the straight with a loved partner number three partner should
[01:42:43 -> 01:42:50]  be from opposite sex right if a male is having orgasm with a male a female is having with a
[01:42:50 -> 01:42:58]  female according to Eric Rickson that is not genital utopia right so that is the first criteria
[01:42:58 -> 01:43:04]  utopia is that right again I will repeat first three criteria but there are six he says that
[01:43:04 -> 01:43:11]  at this stage someone who has reached successfully what he will want out of life he want or she wants
[01:43:11 -> 01:43:21]  mutuality of mutuality of orgasm with the loved one partner right from opposite gender
[01:43:21 -> 01:43:31]  right with whom one is willing and able to share trust the true love is not only sex and orgasms
[01:43:31 -> 01:43:39]  there should be some degree of trust in between right so there should be also trust and with whom
[01:43:39 -> 01:43:47]  any other person with whom one is able to regulate the cycles of work cycles of procreation and
[01:43:48 -> 01:43:56]  cycles of recreation true love does not mean just sex again I'm repeating the component which Eric
[01:43:56 -> 01:44:01]  Rickson said that genital utopia he says it's ideal it is not achievable but this is what
[01:44:02 -> 01:44:07]  almost every girl think that if it can happen in her life and maybe some boys also number one
[01:44:07 -> 01:44:16]  mutuality of orgasm number two with a loved partner number three from the opposite gender
[01:44:17 -> 01:44:22]  number four where you can share trust you can have trust on each other about every matter of
[01:44:22 -> 01:44:32]  the life number five with whom you can share your cycles of work cycles of procreation and recreation
[01:44:32 -> 01:44:37]  they should cooperate with each other in these matters about their work habits about their
[01:44:37 -> 01:44:42]  procreation plan if girl want to be mother and father does not want to be he says no you just
[01:44:42 -> 01:44:47]  remain my girlfriend I will take 20 years to complete my career and then I want to be father
[01:44:48 -> 01:44:55]  that is not an ideal situation right so they should be able to regulate their cycles of work
[01:44:55 -> 01:45:04]  procreation and recreation with each other so that both of them provide a very strong platform
[01:45:05 -> 01:45:08]  for the personality development of their offspring
[01:45:10 -> 01:45:18]  you are understanding so things started from the sexual orgasm and ended up on raising the children
[01:45:19 -> 01:45:28]  with strong personalities that is the whole ideal situation is that right okay now
[01:45:29 -> 01:45:36]  your age is somewhere between 20 to 40 either you will develop intimacy or you will develop
[01:45:36 -> 01:45:42]  isolation and if you have worked hard to be for intimacy then the quality you have developed
[01:45:42 -> 01:45:51]  love now something better and stronger than love is there the next stage this is the second last
[01:45:51 -> 01:45:57]  stage now your age is somewhere between 40 to 60 year personality is still developing
[01:45:57 -> 01:46:04]  there is something very special reward at this stage that is a reward stronger and better than
[01:46:04 -> 01:46:08]  love I know in your age you think there's nothing better than love but we'll see it
[01:46:11 -> 01:46:17]  first of all the mental task at this stage of development it is against generativity
[01:46:17 -> 01:46:23]  generativity versus stagnation
[01:46:26 -> 01:46:27]  stagnation
[01:46:30 -> 01:46:38]  now what is generativity versus stagnation generativity is a term used when
[01:46:40 -> 01:46:44]  there is a change in your you start thinking in a very different way you start
[01:46:45 -> 01:46:53]  thinking that how you can contribute for humanity how you can contribute for upcoming generations
[01:46:54 -> 01:47:00]  whatever you have learned from life you want to give that information and teach it to younger
[01:47:00 -> 01:47:11]  generations with a purpose to make their life easier that is generativity a very common example
[01:47:11 -> 01:47:17]  of generativity is when men and women love their children right they are taking care of them but
[01:47:18 -> 01:47:24]  a stronger people who have hope and determination and purpose and they have developed many skills
[01:47:24 -> 01:47:29]  in their life and they have developed devotion with certain goals of the life and they have
[01:47:29 -> 01:47:35]  been living adult they develop a very special thing now they are not thinking of only loved
[01:47:35 -> 01:47:40]  and they're not thinking of only their loved ones now you will find someone working a new job
[01:47:40 -> 01:47:48]  sending some check for an African child whom he has never met or maybe helping some younger people
[01:47:48 -> 01:47:54]  and giving some advice maybe he's not rich man he's just a taxi driver but that taxi driver is
[01:47:54 -> 01:48:02]  telling a younger taxi driver what are the special secrets of the trade or there may be an 45 year
[01:48:02 -> 01:48:10]  old woman who is telling another woman that adult woman young adult woman like 20 year old woman
[01:48:10 -> 01:48:17]  that how to handle the males you're getting it a new very strong wish start that you have lived
[01:48:17 -> 01:48:22]  here for 40 years you have been through so much things you want to contribute to the upcoming
[01:48:22 -> 01:48:29]  generations and you want to make the things easier for them that is generativity or you go to opposite
[01:48:29 -> 01:48:39]  side stagnation you become a negative way you think world is not trustworthy right you have all
[01:48:39 -> 01:48:44]  negative experiences at this stage you think oh i could not achieve whatever i wanted i've been in
[01:48:44 -> 01:48:52]  a nasty world for such a long time right and you think even younger people they're dangerous for
[01:48:52 -> 01:49:00]  me they're trying to compete me world population is going too much right and they get upset
[01:49:01 -> 01:49:06]  they don't whatever they have they don't want to share with coming generations it's not matter of
[01:49:06 -> 01:49:13]  money it's so the way you mentally think i remember in my country there was a woman who used
[01:49:13 -> 01:49:20]  to work in our family as a maid and she was always happy only worry she had that there's a one very
[01:49:20 -> 01:49:25]  poor girl getting married and how she can collect the money and buy some thing which can make her
[01:49:25 -> 01:49:32]  marriage situation better or that woman who's 45 year old so poor she was made in our family but
[01:49:32 -> 01:49:36]  she's always thinking there's another very poor woman her child is very sick i should arrange
[01:49:36 -> 01:49:43]  medicine right and then there was earthquake in my country and that woman was one of those women
[01:49:43 -> 01:49:49]  with little money she just collect the things first of all right warm clothes and other things
[01:49:49 -> 01:49:53]  and go and deposit to some place so that those things will be transported to the earthquake
[01:49:53 -> 01:50:00]  stricken area that was generativity opposite to that we have a merchant in our neighbors
[01:50:01 -> 01:50:04]  he has everything but he thinks that all other people are trying to grab the things from him
[01:50:06 -> 01:50:13]  he thinks world is not a good place right he has suppose 1 million dollars but he thinks he's
[01:50:13 -> 01:50:19]  hopeless that he can make more even he's worried if he loses this what will happen he is not going
[01:50:19 -> 01:50:26]  to help anyone so now there's another crisis you have to decide that you will participate in
[01:50:27 -> 01:50:33]  generativity or you will become stagnant if you have negative experiences you will become stagnant
[01:50:33 -> 01:50:38]  because now you know you're going downhill around 40 you start feeling your strengths
[01:50:38 -> 01:50:43]  are going down and if you negative experiences you say my strength are going down whatever i
[01:50:43 -> 01:50:50]  have i don't want to share with anyone but if you're positively developed whatever your weaknesses
[01:50:50 -> 01:50:56]  and strengths you want to make life easier for the upcoming generation you know what is the strength
[01:50:56 -> 01:51:06]  you develop here no care you start you become a caring person let me tell you the difference
[01:51:06 -> 01:51:15]  between love and care when you love someone you want some reciprocation for example if you love
[01:51:15 -> 01:51:21]  someone and that person does not love you back can you keep on loving you become angry even you say
[01:51:21 -> 01:51:29]  oh our relationship is not true love is that right love is a quality in which you whenever
[01:51:29 -> 01:51:35]  you give love to others you expect it is conditioned you expect love in return but when you are caring
[01:51:37 -> 01:51:43]  and true caring you don't expect return if someone is working for some orphan children
[01:51:43 -> 01:51:50]  is he expecting something in return if an old taxi driver telling a young boy who has started
[01:51:50 -> 01:51:56]  taxi driving that how to make earn more money and give better service he's expecting something
[01:51:56 -> 01:52:03]  from him or a 45 year old woman who is telling a younger woman how to resolve her emotional
[01:52:03 -> 01:52:08]  conflict with the boyfriend due to her experience she is not expecting that boyfriend will come to
[01:52:08 -> 01:52:19]  her so caring is something beyond love i will define caring is loving people without return
[01:52:19 -> 01:52:26]  expectations right only very lucky people reach to this stage that whatever their life
[01:52:27 -> 01:52:33]  you may find in your school that you may find a gate man a poor man and he's in generativity
[01:52:33 -> 01:52:40]  you may find a very strong rich man but he's stagnant start with your own self you care for
[01:52:40 -> 01:52:44]  yourself you care for your children you care your friends and then you start caring even those people
[01:52:44 -> 01:52:52]  whom you don't know is that right your personality has developed up to now now you go 60 and beyond
[01:52:53 -> 01:53:03]  right 60 and plus and here you may have this crown or you may be very disturbed man or very happy man
[01:53:04 -> 01:53:13]  you reach at this stage here again you have to do one more mental task to develop your personality
[01:53:13 -> 01:53:21]  and you have a chance to get the last and the best reward of your life the mental task is integrity
[01:53:25 -> 01:53:26]  versus despair
[01:53:29 -> 01:53:33]  this is the time when old people start looking back on their life
[01:53:34 -> 01:53:41]  they look that inning they have played is well played or not how was the life is that right
[01:53:42 -> 01:53:48]  now what really happens in old age there is a lot of tragedies coming your physical strength is weak
[01:53:49 -> 01:53:56]  you may develop financial insecurities you start seeing your spouse may have died your friends are
[01:53:56 -> 01:54:03]  dying your relatives are dying in old age right and even you have a real risk of dying
[01:54:05 -> 01:54:10]  at this stage the person who has gone through these all positive things okay first I will
[01:54:10 -> 01:54:21]  tell you the negative person negative person at this age will become very despair very negative
[01:54:21 -> 01:54:29]  experience of life at this stage he is hopeless about his future and when his capabilities are
[01:54:29 -> 01:54:36]  reducing right and what will happen to the negative okay I will give you some example because it's
[01:54:36 -> 01:54:41]  complex to explain I will give you an example to explain the situation you may find an old man
[01:54:41 -> 01:54:47]  sitting there and he sees young people and he's very unhappy why young people are so happy
[01:54:47 -> 01:54:55]  why they should be happy they are very nasty boys and girls our old times were good right he does
[01:54:55 -> 01:55:02]  he can only be angry with them or scold them but he is not willing to give any advice or make things
[01:55:02 -> 01:55:10]  easier for them and as he see younger generations their strength their beauty their enthusiasm
[01:55:10 -> 01:55:17]  disturb him and he will he's more fearful of death and he's feeling person who has gone through
[01:55:17 -> 01:55:23]  negative experiences he is feeling that he has lost an end and he will decide world was not
[01:55:23 -> 01:55:30]  worth living place but in spite of that decision he is more afraid of death because there's
[01:55:30 -> 01:55:37]  uncertainty what will happen after that this person is a big trouble for himself as well as
[01:55:37 -> 01:55:44]  for anyone other who is going to take care of this old person right you just imagine that there is
[01:55:44 -> 01:55:49]  one boy and girl and they're trying to make some love or some situation kissing around and an old
[01:55:49 -> 01:55:55]  woman look at them and she become angry when we were like this no one allowed us this they don't
[01:55:55 -> 01:56:01]  know how to do this why they should do here they should know I'm here they should go somewhere else
[01:56:01 -> 01:56:06]  this generation world is going to be destroyed because these this generation is there you know
[01:56:06 -> 01:56:12]  hopelessness opposite to that look at a person who is negative who is positively developed
[01:56:13 -> 01:56:19]  maybe 80 year old person who has cancer he's going to die maybe after one month
[01:56:20 -> 01:56:27]  the old woman but she has developed positive thing she has hope she say okay I'm going to die
[01:56:27 -> 01:56:34]  so what my children will live even she does not have children she think other person's children
[01:56:34 -> 01:56:39]  will live on earth world is becoming better I've played my inning well I'm very comfortable with
[01:56:39 -> 01:56:46]  myself right and she will be happy that I've played my innings well and I as for as long as I'm alive
[01:56:46 -> 01:56:53]  I will enjoy seeing other people playing even this time become fun for them maybe this old
[01:56:53 -> 01:56:59]  woman who's having cancer she is going to die after few days and her grandson come and she
[01:56:59 -> 01:57:09]  still has all the positive trait to tell the fairy tales to the grandson is that right still she can
[01:57:09 -> 01:57:14]  imagine my grandson will be very strong and he will have children and things will become good
[01:57:14 -> 01:57:20]  and world is becoming better you are getting it and still at this time the people will try to
[01:57:20 -> 01:57:30]  contribute to the world and if what we say they have developed integrity strength and all these
[01:57:31 -> 01:57:39]  personality strength will come together and you will develop a very special trait what is that
[01:57:39 -> 01:57:52]  wisdom integrity comes with along with it it brings wisdom and the more the curse of wisdom
[01:57:52 -> 01:57:58]  is that a special type of thinking develop at this stage if you have been on the positive side
[01:57:59 -> 01:58:06]  you are not loving only yourself not only your family you start loving the everyone in the world
[01:58:06 -> 01:58:15]  you start loving and caring for the mankind you say mankind is my kind you don't expect 10 year
[01:58:15 -> 01:58:21]  old child to love everyone in the world but person who has gone through positive he will love everyone
[01:58:21 -> 01:58:26]  in the world and he'll love it so much that even death is very imminent they are still happy that
[01:58:26 -> 01:58:31]  many other human beings are living and probably they will make the world better than this
[01:58:31 -> 01:58:38]  better than this so they will go with confidence without fear face the death
[01:58:40 -> 01:58:48]  and these people while they are moving towards the death right they started generativity and then
[01:58:48 -> 01:58:54]  integrity do you think before they died they raised their kids in a negative way or positive
[01:58:54 -> 01:59:00]  way people on the side positive way so eric rickson said when he written all this theory
[01:59:00 -> 01:59:10]  in the end that if elderly are not afraid of death then their children are not afraid of life
[01:59:12 -> 01:59:16]  if elderly are not afraid of death then their children are not afraid of
[01:59:17 -> 01:59:24]  life what he was saying that if you are positively developing you will take care of your children
[01:59:24 -> 01:59:29]  such a way that first of all you are so strong you can face the death and then you raise the
[01:59:29 -> 01:59:36]  children who can face the life and challenges but somewhere if elderly is a very much afraid of
[01:59:36 -> 01:59:41]  death believe me their children are afraid of life and the challenges because of negative minded
[01:59:41 -> 01:59:49]  persons here weak personality here raising the children in weak ways you are understanding it
[01:59:50 -> 01:59:55]  and the beauty of all this thing is that life started with the lap of mother
[01:59:55 -> 02:00:02]  life started with the lap of mother if you have positive experiences from there
[02:00:03 -> 02:00:09]  when you will go to the lap of your loved one you will have again positive experiences
[02:00:11 -> 02:00:17]  and such person who has started his travel from the lap of mother in a positive way
[02:00:17 -> 02:00:22]  when he will go to loved one he will have positive experiences
[02:00:23 -> 02:00:28]  and when he is going to the lap of God he is anticipating more positive experiences
[02:00:30 -> 02:00:34]  am I clear to everyone? Blasphemous!
