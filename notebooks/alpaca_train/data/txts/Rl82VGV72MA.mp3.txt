[00:00:00 -> 00:00:03]  Welcome to the third part in the series on promotion strategy.
[00:00:03 -> 00:00:08]  We're going to finish up our discussion on the introduction
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:11]  to the promotion piece of the marketing mix today.
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:16]  We talked about the definition of promotion, what it is
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:17]  and what it's not, and some cautions.
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:21]  I introduced you to some of the strategies involved
[00:00:21 -> 00:00:24]  in promotion activity, push and pull strategies,
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:25]  and when to use them.
