[00:00:00 -> 00:00:02]  Hi, this is Jonathan Rotz, Field Agronomist with Pioneer.
[00:00:02 -> 00:00:07]  I'm back here today in this same cover crop field that we had earlier, and you can see
[00:00:07 -> 00:00:08]  it's still green and growing.
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:13]  Now some folks may say that a cover crop this size is way too big to worry about planting
[00:00:13 -> 00:00:17]  through, and there are some challenges that come along with it.
[00:00:17 -> 00:00:20]  But just as a lot of producers that I work with have found out, there are ways to get
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:24]  through this, and there's actually some benefits down the road as well.
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:26]  More on that in some later videos.
[00:00:26 -> 00:00:31]  Cover crops have a lot of benefits, including soil preservation, carbon sequestration, increased
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:37]  organic matter in soils, both nutrient creation and retention, and many more.
[00:00:37 -> 00:00:42]  However, as we try to maximize some of these benefits, we can also create management challenges
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:43]  for the crop.
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:48]  This first challenge we meet in the spring is at planting time.
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:52]  This video will highlight how some producers are working to manage through some of these
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:53]  challenges.
[00:00:53 -> 00:00:57]  The first challenge we come to is simply planting through this amount of biomass.
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:01]  As discussed last time, some of this starts in the fall by not planting your cover crop
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:04]  very heavy to make sure that biomass is manageable.
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:07]  About one bushel of small grain is enough.
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:12]  Many producers who have adopted planting into large cover are also using some form of rolling
[00:01:12 -> 00:01:16]  to lay the cover down before or at planting.
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:21]  These rollers not only push the cover down, but they also crimp the cover.
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:26]  This helps so that the cover crop will not stand back up, as well as starting the process
[00:01:26 -> 00:01:32]  of decomposition and nutrient release by keeping the cover crop in contact with the soil.
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:37]  In this scenario, this crop was sprayed with herbicide just prior to rolling.
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:41]  The next part is to make sure that your planter is set up to not wrap the cover crop while
[00:01:41 -> 00:01:46]  still making a good zone for the seed to be planted into, including proper closing of
[00:01:46 -> 00:01:48]  the seed trench.
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:52]  Many options are available for planters that can work in these scenarios, but discussing
[00:01:52 -> 00:01:56]  these options with others who are having success is a great place to start.
[00:01:56 -> 00:02:01]  When planting into cover crops, either make sure the crop is dead and somewhat dry, or
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:03]  live and growing.
[00:02:03 -> 00:02:06]  These are the two best ways to manage the cover crop so that your planter does not have
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:11]  issues cutting through the cover, creating hair pinning in the furrow.
[00:02:11 -> 00:02:15]  When a cover crop is in the process of dying, it can be hard to cut through.
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:20]  Of course, planting into cover is also no different than any other planting that you
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:24]  must make sure that the soil is dry.
[00:02:24 -> 00:02:28]  Many have found that a live, active, growing cover crop will actually help pull moisture
[00:02:28 -> 00:02:33]  out of the soil, whereas a dead cover will keep soils wet.
[00:02:33 -> 00:02:36]  Once the cover crop is rolled and planted through, you now have a nice mat of biomass
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:41]  that will keep soil moisture in, as well as help to compete with weeds.
[00:02:41 -> 00:02:46]  This biomass will break down over time, re-releasing nutrition to the growing crop.
[00:02:46 -> 00:02:51]  Now interestingly enough, right between these two fields, we're seeing some differences
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:52]  in some cover crops.
[00:02:52 -> 00:02:58]  This is mainly due to both species and planting date, but it brings up the interesting observation
[00:02:58 -> 00:03:03]  of what happens whenever we have different sizes of cover crops, and this all comes back
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:06]  to general agronomy and carbon to nitrogen ratios.
[00:03:06 -> 00:03:12]  As we get larger and larger cover, we have more stem elongation, and more of those proteins
[00:03:12 -> 00:03:15]  are put into the head production as well as grain.
[00:03:15 -> 00:03:20]  This means we're going to have a lower nitrogen or a higher carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[00:03:20 -> 00:03:23]  This will be slower to die and decompose over the year.
[00:03:23 -> 00:03:29]  Smaller covers on the other side will have higher carbon to nitrogen and will be quicker
[00:03:29 -> 00:03:31]  to disappear throughout the year.
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:34]  Again, we'll see more about this on later videos.
[00:03:34 -> 00:03:39]  This mat of material is a good thing, but it can also make it difficult to get nitrogen
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:46]  to the growing crop early on as it breaks down because it has a lot of carbon to decompose.
[00:03:46 -> 00:03:49]  Because of this, I like to have a significant amount of nitrogen put down with the planter
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:54]  into the soil below the cover crop to carry the crop to side dress time.
[00:03:54 -> 00:03:58]  Although planting through large cover may not be for everyone, I hope that this has
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:01]  at least highlighted how some are making it work.
[00:04:01 -> 00:04:05]  I hope this video has given you some things to consider if you are thinking about changing
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:07]  your cover cropping practices.
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:11]  As always, talk to those who are already doing this to get some tips and tricks, and when
[00:04:11 -> 00:04:17]  trying different things, start in small stages to see what's best for your operation.
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:21]  Thanks for your time, and I hope you found this video informative and helpful.
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:24]  We'll continue to return to this operation and field to highlight some of the benefits
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:29]  we can see with cover crops throughout this season, so keep an eye out for more videos
[00:04:29 -> 00:04:29]  like this.
