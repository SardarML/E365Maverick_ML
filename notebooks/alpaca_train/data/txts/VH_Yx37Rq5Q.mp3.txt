[00:00:00 -> 00:00:10]  Let's explore the anatomical organization of the body.
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:17]  The body is made up of anatomical levels that increase in their complexity, from the smallest,
[00:00:17 -> 00:00:24]  most fundamental units of our being, all the way up to the entire organism as a whole.
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:29]  In order to understand our anatomical makeup, we must first understand what we are made
[00:00:29 -> 00:00:33]  of and how we are put together.
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:39]  The major levels of organization in the body, from the simplest to the most complex, are
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:50]  atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, and the human organism.
[00:00:50 -> 00:00:52]  So what are we really made of?
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:54]  Let's zoom in.
[00:00:54 -> 00:00:58]  We begin at the atomic level of organization.
[00:00:58 -> 00:01:03]  At this level, the human body is composed of atoms.
[00:01:03 -> 00:01:10]  Atoms are made up of three subatomic particles, positively charged protons, negatively charged
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:14]  electrons, and neutrons, which have no charge.
[00:01:14 -> 00:01:22]  More than 96% of the mass of the human body is made up of only four elements, oxygen,
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:27]  carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen.
[00:01:27 -> 00:01:34]  Oxygen is the most abundant element contained in the human body, making up about 65% of
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:36]  its mass.
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:43]  Carbon atoms can form up to four strong covalent bonds, making up the backbone of most organic
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:44]  molecules.
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:49]  Carbon is the basis for all life on Earth.
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:52]  Hydrogen is the simplest element.
[00:01:52 -> 00:01:57]  Its atom contains only a single proton and a single neutron.
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:04]  As a result of this simplicity, hydrogen readily bonds with other elements, making it an important
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:09]  component for the formation of living organisms.
[00:02:09 -> 00:02:17]  Nitrogen atoms are important components of many proteins and of DNA.
[00:02:17 -> 00:02:25]  At the molecular level of our anatomical organization, atoms come together forming molecules.
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:31]  A molecule is composed of two or more atoms bound together.
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:37]  Smaller molecules can combine with one another to form the large macromolecules needed for
[00:02:37 -> 00:02:40]  life to exist on our planet.
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:47]  These are proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates.
[00:02:47 -> 00:02:53]  Proteins are formed by assembling many units of amino acids together.
[00:02:53 -> 00:02:57]  Proteins provide the majority of the functions of the cell.
[00:02:57 -> 00:03:05]  The body uses protein to build and repair tissues and to make enzymes, hormones, and
[00:03:05 -> 00:03:09]  other molecules the body needs.
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:16]  Another important macromolecule needed for life is nucleic acids.
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:20]  Nucleic acids make up RNA and DNA.
[00:03:20 -> 00:03:28]  These molecules specialize in the storage and expression of genetic information.
[00:03:28 -> 00:03:32]  Lipids are another important macromolecule.
[00:03:32 -> 00:03:38]  Lipids perform three primary biological functions within the human body.
[00:03:38 -> 00:03:47]  They serve as structural components of cell membranes, energy storehouses, and important
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:50]  signaling molecules.
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:58]  Carbohydrates are sugars including monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:03]  Polysaccharides are used for storing energy, for cellular messaging, and for supporting
[00:04:03 -> 00:04:06]  the cells and tissues.
[00:04:06 -> 00:04:12]  It takes trillions of atoms and molecules to make one single cell.
[00:04:12 -> 00:04:17]  This brings us to the cellular level of our anatomical organization.
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:22]  The human body consists of around 100 trillion cells.
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:26]  It is at the cellular level where life begins.
[00:04:26 -> 00:04:31]  The cell is the fundamental unit of all life on earth.
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:35]  All living things are composed of at least one living cell.
[00:04:35 -> 00:04:41]  The cell is the smallest independently functioning unit of a living organism.
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:47]  The human body has more than 200 distinct cell types.
[00:04:47 -> 00:04:54]  Cells of similar types or common embryonic origin come together to form tissues.
[00:04:54 -> 00:04:59]  This brings us to the tissue level of anatomical organization.
[00:04:59 -> 00:05:04]  There are four types of tissues found in the human body.
[00:05:04 -> 00:05:12]  Epithelial tissues, connective tissues, muscle tissues, and nervous tissues.
[00:05:12 -> 00:05:17]  Epithelial cells come together to form epithelial tissues.
[00:05:17 -> 00:05:21]  Epithelial tissues form the body's barriers.
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:28]  Connective tissue includes bone, cartilage, blood, and supportive tissues referred to
[00:05:28 -> 00:05:31]  as connective tissue proper.
[00:05:31 -> 00:05:35]  Muscle cells come together to form muscle tissue.
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:38]  There are three types of muscle tissues.
[00:05:38 -> 00:05:44]  Smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle tissue.
[00:05:44 -> 00:05:50]  Smooth muscle allows substances to move through the body without conscious control, such as
[00:05:50 -> 00:05:54]  food moving through the digestive tract.
[00:05:54 -> 00:05:59]  Cardiac muscle allows the contractions of the heart muscle.
[00:05:59 -> 00:06:04]  Skeletal muscle attaches to bones, allowing for conscious movement.
[00:06:04 -> 00:06:11]  Nerve cells or neurons come together forming the major cell type of nervous tissue.
[00:06:11 -> 00:06:17]  Nervous tissue allows for integration and communication.
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:21]  Different tissue types come together to form organs.
[00:06:21 -> 00:06:26]  This brings us to the organ level of our anatomical organization.
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:30]  Organs provide specific functions in the body.
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:34]  For example, the brain is the control center of the body.
[00:06:34 -> 00:06:41]  It receives sensory input, integrates information, and sends motor commands.
[00:06:41 -> 00:06:47]  The heart is an organ that functions to pump the blood through the blood vessels.
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:53]  The kidneys are organs that filter the blood and make urine.
[00:06:53 -> 00:07:00]  The lungs function to inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.
[00:07:00 -> 00:07:05]  The stomach is an important organ for digestion.
[00:07:05 -> 00:07:11]  Organs work together in the body in a cooperative fashion as organ systems.
[00:07:11 -> 00:07:17]  This brings us to the organ systems level of our anatomical organization.
[00:07:17 -> 00:07:24]  The human body has 12 organ systems, each of which contains several specific organs
[00:07:24 -> 00:07:29]  working together to perform specific functions in the body.
[00:07:29 -> 00:07:37]  These include the digestive system, the integumentary system, the nervous system, the cardiovascular
[00:07:37 -> 00:07:46]  system, the respiratory system, the skeletal system, the muscular system, the immune system,
[00:07:46 -> 00:07:55]  the lymphatic system, the endocrine system, the reproductive system, and the urinary system.
[00:07:55 -> 00:08:02]  The digestive system functions to absorb nutrients from the foods we eat and to eliminate indigestible
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:03]  waste.
[00:08:03 -> 00:08:10]  Ingested food must be broken down and processed to make nutrients available for the tissues.
[00:08:10 -> 00:08:17]  The portion that is not digested is eliminated from the body in the form of feces.
[00:08:17 -> 00:08:24]  The integumentary system includes the skin, hair, nails, and exocrine glands.
[00:08:24 -> 00:08:30]  The integumentary system forms the external body covering and protects deeper tissues
[00:08:30 -> 00:08:32]  from injury.
[00:08:32 -> 00:08:39]  It houses important touch, pain, and temperature receptors, along with sweat glands and oil
[00:08:39 -> 00:08:41]  glands.
[00:08:41 -> 00:08:48]  The nervous system allows for fast, specific communication between the body and the brain.
[00:08:48 -> 00:08:54]  Both conscious and unconscious sensory information is gathered about the state of our external
[00:08:54 -> 00:08:57]  and internal environments.
[00:08:57 -> 00:09:03]  This information is gathered by sensory receptor cells and sent to the central nervous system
[00:09:03 -> 00:09:05]  for processing.
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:10]  The central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.
[00:09:10 -> 00:09:16]  The central nervous system integrates and processes this information and then forms
[00:09:16 -> 00:09:17]  a response.
[00:09:17 -> 00:09:22]  These motor commands then travel from the central nervous system to the peripheral nervous
[00:09:22 -> 00:09:24]  system.
[00:09:24 -> 00:09:30]  Motor neurons will innervate muscles and glands that will then carry out the motor commands
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:32]  from the central nervous system.
[00:09:32 -> 00:09:39]  The cardiovascular system functions to circulate blood around the body through the blood vessels.
[00:09:39 -> 00:09:45]  The heart is the organ of the cardiovascular system that creates the pressure needed to
[00:09:45 -> 00:09:49]  pump the blood through the blood vessels.
[00:09:49 -> 00:09:55]  Red blood cells circulate throughout the body, delivering oxygen to the cells and tissues,
[00:09:55 -> 00:09:59]  while picking up carbon dioxide.
[00:09:59 -> 00:10:06]  When these red blood cells pass by the lungs, they release carbon dioxide and pick up oxygen.
[00:10:06 -> 00:10:12]  The respiratory system includes the network of airways that allows for gas exchange.
[00:10:12 -> 00:10:18]  The respiratory system takes in oxygen and expels carbon dioxide.
[00:10:18 -> 00:10:25]  The skeletal system consists of bones, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments.
[00:10:25 -> 00:10:30]  The skeletal system works as a supportive structure for your body.
[00:10:30 -> 00:10:38]  It gives the body its shape, allows for movement, makes blood cells, provides protection, and
[00:10:38 -> 00:10:40]  stores minerals.
[00:10:40 -> 00:10:46]  The muscular system is composed of specialized cells called muscle fibers.
[00:10:46 -> 00:10:50]  Muscle fibers contract to allow for movement.
[00:10:50 -> 00:10:56]  The muscular system includes the cardiac muscles that powers the muscular contraction of the
[00:10:56 -> 00:10:58]  heart.
[00:10:58 -> 00:11:05]  It also includes the smooth muscle that enables substances to be moved through the body.
[00:11:05 -> 00:11:11]  Skeletal muscle attaches to bones, allowing for purposeful movements that are under conscious
[00:11:11 -> 00:11:13]  control.
[00:11:13 -> 00:11:20]  The immune system defends the body against physical injury and protects us from pathogens
[00:11:20 -> 00:11:22]  that may cause harm.
[00:11:22 -> 00:11:30]  The immune system includes a variety of defenses against bacteria, viruses, fungal infections,
[00:11:30 -> 00:11:32]  and parasites.
[00:11:32 -> 00:11:38]  The lymphatic system is composed of a network of lymphatic vessels that carry a clear fluid
[00:11:38 -> 00:11:40]  called lymph.
[00:11:40 -> 00:11:45]  The white blood cells of the immune system can travel through the lymph and through the
[00:11:45 -> 00:11:51]  blood, protecting us from infection that can cause illness and disease.
[00:11:51 -> 00:11:58]  The lymphatic system also functions to drain excess fluids and proteins from the tissues
[00:11:58 -> 00:12:05]  all around the body and then returns them back into the bloodstream.
[00:12:05 -> 00:12:11]  The endocrine system influences the functions of the body by using hormones.
[00:12:11 -> 00:12:18]  Glands from the endocrine system secrete hormones that regulate many processes such as growth,
[00:12:18 -> 00:12:22]  metabolism, and reproduction.
[00:12:22 -> 00:12:29]  The endocrine system works together with the nervous system to maintain homeostasis.
[00:12:29 -> 00:12:33]  The reproductive system allows us to make offspring.
[00:12:33 -> 00:12:41]  It functions to produce egg and sperm cells, to transport and sustain these cells, and
[00:12:41 -> 00:12:44]  to nurture developing offspring.
[00:12:44 -> 00:12:52]  The urinary or renal system produces, stores, and eliminates urine.
[00:12:52 -> 00:12:56]  Urine is a fluid that is excreted by the kidneys.
[00:12:56 -> 00:13:02]  The kidneys make urine by filtering wastes and extra water from the blood.
[00:13:02 -> 00:13:07]  All of these anatomical layers increase in their complexity.
[00:13:07 -> 00:13:12]  All of the organ systems come together to create the total organism.
[00:13:12 -> 00:13:18]  This brings us to the organism level of our anatomical organization.
[00:13:18 -> 00:13:24]  It takes all of these levels of organization to create a really awesome you.
[00:13:24 -> 00:13:28]  You are multifaceted, elegant, and complex.
[00:13:28 -> 00:13:30]  Now, aren't you amazing?
