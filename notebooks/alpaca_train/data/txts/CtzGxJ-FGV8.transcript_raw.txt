 hello everyone this is human hard drive and if you're watching this it means  you're watching the first in the series of electronics 101 so electronics 101 is  the video where we're going to be going over everything having to do with analog  electronics so those are the various components you'd see if you were to open  up your computer or drop something and happen to take a look inside or well  anything of that sort this is in digital electronics we're not going to be  dealing with like ICs such as we'd be dealing with when I'm talking about the  Arduino but it is a good basis because in a lot of digital electronics you do  need these assisting components so this is the video these are the video series  if you want to understand what I'm talking about when I go off on one of my  tangents during one of my other videos or if you just want to have a better  understanding of what electronics is and as you're about to see it's a pretty  complicated subject so let's get started with what is electricity so what is  electricity it's a good question this isn't a physics lesson so we're not  going to be concerning ourselves with exactly what electricity may be but I'm  gonna hit on it a little bit right now but just remember we're not going to be  discussing a lot of the physics of stuff so as an engineer we carry we care  about measurements and there are two ways we care about electricity and this  is V for volts and A for amps and that's on the end okay so volts what is voltage  that's E per Q that's energy per charge and there's amps which if you know your  calculus is DQ DT or Delta Q Delta T which is charge per time so what does  that mean well it's kind of a difficult thing to explain and it's because when  you're talking about voltage and amperage what you're talking about is  electrons moving through wires and across materials and through  distributions and it is difficult for people to think like that but I think  there's a fairly good analogy say you've got a hose yes this is a hose okay when  you're dealing with voltage that's the pressure difference let me show you what  I mean so here's your hose I'm gonna give it a place for water to flow out  and let's give it some water and of course it's gonna spill out of it and  there we go okay so let's look at this point in the hose P1 and out here P2 so  these are the two pressures now there's a lot of water in the hose and there's a  confining space so the pressure in here is pretty great greater than pressure to  where there's no confining space for the water to be jammed against one another  so that's sort of like voltage so out here you've got your high voltage so  your five volts plus and out here you've got your ground that's zero volts okay  then you've got amps which is volume of water so we look here a one amount one  and out here a two the amount of water is the same so the current is the same  so how can we tweak that current how can we make current go up or down so let's take a  second hose but let's tweak it a bit let's add an obstruction so this is like  you putting your thumb over the end of a hose and let's put some water back in  here so the water is filling the hose till it reaches the obstruction and  squirts out okay so here's pressure one here's pressure two here's amount one  and here's amount two okay so pressure one is still greater than pressure two  and in this case it's a lot greater than here because of this thing right here so  let's this is resisting  it's resisting the flow of water or resisting as we'll talk about the flow  of current so it's at an in effect a resistor all right this is actually  acting as something called a voltage choke which we'll talk about in later  videos now the amount of water at point one is greater than the amount of water  it's greater than the amount of water at point A2 so the resistance is acting  to keep more water here and less water here so what does that mean why is that  important well let's move on but before we do that let's nail down some symbols  because what we're also going to talk about in these videos are schematics and  how to draw them what they mean crucial stuff so let's just talk about three  basic symbols the battery the resistor and the switch now there are different  ways to draw these symbols these are just the ways I draw them depending on  whether you're looking at the American way or the European way it will change  it okay so there are actually two kinds of batteries in schematics and they're  usually denoted as such one is a unicell the other is a multi cell and I know  this runs into that so if you've ever taken apart like an 9-volt battery I'm  not suggesting you do I'm just saying if you have you'll notice it's a it's a  stack of button batteries so it's a multi cell where is that those  individual button batteries are each unicells okay now resistor is just a  bunch of squiggly lines resistors are denoted it is are measured in ohms which  is the Greek letter Omega so you can have a hundred ohm resistor you can have  a kilo ohm resistor you can have a pico ohm resistor although I've never seen a  pico ohm resistor and then you've got a switch which is just these two things  when it's closed this will shut and it'll form a wire so let's move on so  let's do some math because this is the bread and the butter of it ohms law  that's ohms laws oh there's really only one ohms law ohms law talks about the  relationship between voltage  current  and resistance  so that's V a and Omega so their direct voltage is directly proportional to  current and resistance so let's look at the all the derivations because these  are quite important first you have V equals I are then you have I equals V  over R and R equals I over V I'm gonna highlight these because these you're  going to use a lot  okay now when you do circuit analysis which we'll get into a little bit in  later videos current is important I is very important because it it's going to  talk about how much current your various devices can handle how much power  they're gonna deal with and what your battery can source at any given time  again all things we'll talk about later so what does this mean how does ohms law  relate to resistance and electricity okay well so you've got a battery and  you've got a switch and there we go so if you close the switch  what happens well as any of you know or if you haven't done this already you  might want to do this just for the experience you get a short circuit what  does that mean well a short circuit first off is bad very bad what it means  is that the current going through the circuit see circuit circle the current  going through the circuit is greater than the battery can handle so it's  going to cause it to heat up so if we look at if we call this a 5-volt battery  let's look at I the amount of current in the system I equals voltage divided by  resistance okay so this is just wire what is the resistance of wire well it  is effectively zero the resistance of wire isn't actually zero but it's close  enough as to make no difference so if we plug that into the equation five volts  over zero what do we get well that's undefined but if we go back to our old  friend calculus as our if we take the limit as our approach is zero of 5 over  R that actually goes to infinity so you actually have an infinite current now  you don't have an infinite current because there is a resistance in the  wire which slows it down a bit and there's only so much current your  battery can source at any given time so it's not infinite but again there's more  current going back into the battery than is supposed to so that causes it to heat  up now heat is a form of power this is the equation for power now power for  almost all electronic devices has to be dissipated in some way and how is that  dissipated well it's almost always in heat so the battery in order to get rid  of that excess power gets really hot and the wire will get hot or start to  catch fire the battery will catch fire which is generally a bad thing so if we  plug our current into the equation times our voltage you get an infinite amount  of wattage again that's not technically true because the current isn't infinity  but still you have a lot of watts a lot of heat that's bad so how can we prevent  this well ohms law so if we take our circuit give the same battery 5 volts  put the switch in but this time we throw in say a resistor and we'll give this a  hundred ohms what happens so we close the switch  and this time we don't get a short circuit why well V equals IR I equals V  over R equals 5 over 100 equals 0.05 amps oh sorry  went to went to the edge of the screen there so what those little nuts 0.05  amps or 50 milliamps so it's not as much current as say an infinite number of  amps and if we look at the power 5 times 0.05 0.25 watts now this number is  important so I'm going to highlight that because we're going to talk about that  in the next video it lets me there we go that's important so why does this work  and this one doesn't it has to do with this component right here and something  called voltage drop every component in the circuit works to drop the power  supplies voltage so in this in this circuit there were no resistive  components every component has a certain resistance so everything helps to drop  that current well in this one there's no components to help resist that current  so the voltage drop across this thing is zero so the voltage going in is that 5  volts that was coming out this one this resistor is actually dropping the whole  5 volts so at this point there's 5 volts this point there's 0 volts so at this  point there's 5 volts and at this point there's 0 volts so this entire thing is  dropping that 5 volts and putting out that quarter watt of power that's that  heat so that's what the resistor does that's going to prevent the short  circuit this is basically any element in a circuit is going to do this it's going  to resist the flow of current and protect against a short-circuit okay so  just to sum up what is electricity well it's measured in volts and amps again  this stuff is really superfluous this is just going over the physics of it not  really as important as this learning the difference between voltage and amps and  what that actually means volts is the pressure difference as we can see here  the difference between 5 volts and 0 volts and amps is the amount of water or  the number of electrons flowing through the circuit so here there's technically  an infinite number of electrons flowing and they're flowing really fast here not  as many electrons flowing per time so it's not short shorting out it's not  causing heat and it's protecting your battery and that's the final thing we  went over power what does that mean how it gets rid of heat or how much heat is  generated so that's it for this video in the next video next video we're going to  be talking about our good old friends the resistors now we started talking  about resistors in this video but we're gonna go more in depth and we're also  going to talk about PVS which we'll learn more about in the next video now  I'm putting out a request to the viewers if you like these videos or if you have  questions because I'm really all about answering your questions and helping you  learn more post questions in the comments and I will try to get to them  every third videos every third video will try and be a comment question video  so if you've got questions anything I've done or
