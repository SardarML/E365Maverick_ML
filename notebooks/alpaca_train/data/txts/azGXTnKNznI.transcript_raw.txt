 So far in Guatemala, I've been throughout the highlands, I've traveled to Lake Atitlan,  I made it through Alta Verapaz, the central department, and I'm finally here in the outskirts  of Coban, in the center of Guatemala.  On this leg of the trip, I'm going to be going from Coban all the way up to Flores and further  on to Tikal, which many call the cultural hearth of the Mayan civilization.  It's a pleasure to welcome you.  Gracias.  Marcio.  What is that?  Where do you learn?  Perfect.  Where did you learn?  I learned in the Bahamas.  In the Bahamas?  Yes.  In the Bahamas.  In the Bahamas.  In the Bahamas.  In the Bahamas.  In the Bahamas.  I don't understand much, but...  Oh, okay.  Only a little.  K'iche.  K'iche.  Oh, okay.  Very good.  They're similar, but different.  Yes.  In Guatemala, there are 23 Mayan languages.  Yes.  Yes.  With Spanish, 24.  Yes.  But they are different.  We use Spanish to understand the communication.  Yes.  Yes. We are at an altitude of 1,335 meters above sea level and a rainfall of 3,000 millimeters per year.  Do you understand?  Yes, I understand.  The average temperature is 20 degrees Celsius.  This data means that we produce a quality coffee.  It is strictly hard, like guan.  Its characteristics are fine.  It has excellent acidity with an intense aroma.  A subtle fruity fragrance.  It is very sweet, like caramel.  The coffee has sugars, acidity, and oil.  We have three varieties.  In the market, there are two types of coffee.  Arabica and Canephora.  Canephora is known as robusta.  The best Arabica is grown at high altitudes, from 900 meters to 1,800 meters.  Robusta, at 500 meters, 600 meters, needs a warm climate.  Arabica needs a cold climate.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.  I come to the coffee fields and we get a tour with a man named Alvaro.  I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but I was really interested in the history of these coffee fields.  Because for a long part of Guatemala's history, coffee was by far the number one export.  But in our community, until 1910, they founded the Chicoff farm with our grandparents.  But now it's not a farm anymore, it's a cooperative.  It's integrated by small producers.  Yes, and with a business focus.  I learned that these coffee fields, which are named the Chicoff coffee fields,  are ran by the Kekchi tribe, which is the majority tribe in the center of Guatemala.  While learning about these fields, I'm able to walk around the plantation and get to see the coffee beans for myself.  Now it's his turn.  Yes, for a moment.  Do you want to keep going?  Here we have the Borbon variety.  It has a better taste in the cup.  It has a good body, good balance.  It's very complete in the cup.  To recognize it, it's because of its high support.  Do you realize? The plant is very tall.  And here we have a variety called Sarchimor.  It's low.  And they're the same?  They're the same species.  Arabic.  But with a different variety.  It changed its genetics.  Coffee plants change their genetics by mutation, by nature, or by the creation of man.  Now that this is done, I can make an injection.  Now, this with this.  New plant.  I'm going to add another name to identify it.  In Guatemala, there are many coffee varieties.  And the varieties adapt to the climate of the place.  For the American, the European, to process a coffee, it requires a lot of processing.  Number one, remove the pulp.  You don't use the pulp?  No.  Here is the honey layer, stuck.  When I do it like this, it comes out.  Now, do you realize? My finger is getting wet.  To remove this honey, I need to ferment the coffee.  Deposit the coffee in water.  For 24 to 30 hours, depending on the climate.  If there is heat, the process is accelerated. If there is cold, it is delayed.  After the fermentation, I have to wash the coffee.  After washing, I dry it in the sun or in the machine.  And here you use machines?  We have a machine and we also have drying areas.  Manual.  Exactly, manual.  This is the washing.  But now there is natural coffee.  I cut the plant and take it directly to the sun.  How many people work here?  People with plots are 427.  With small plots of coffee.  But there are about 1,200 workers.  1,200?  We are not enough to harvest the fruits.  There are people from other communities who live near our community.  We are also generating jobs in the area where we are.  When the Germans were expelled, there was extreme poverty in the farm.  Our parents had to emigrate to the south coast, to another town, to work.  But now we have turned the page.  Now no one emigrates to us.  Here we are generating jobs.  For us and for our neighbors.  But we had to change the way our parents worked.  Because our parents worked by tradition.  They loved the plant.  They didn't care if the plant produced or not.  They just did what they did.  But we changed their way of thinking.  We told them that we wanted to be productive.  But it was hard to convince them.  Because how could the son tell the father that coffee is not made like that?  That now we are going to change the way we work.  But we did it.  That's why we increased our production.  But we are doing a trip all over Guatemala.  For how long?  More than a week.  Where did you learn Spanish?  I don't know exactly. I just learned by speaking.  It's not my first time.  Just English.  We both speak Spanish.  Just by speaking and practicing.  And reading a lot.  But do you speak Spanish fluently?  No, not really.  But we can understand each other.  I don't know why, but we can understand each other.  Because of this trip, I wanted to learn a little bit about the Mayan languages.  But it's very difficult because there isn't a lot of information about them.  No, it's like they are more authentic.  They are more of a people.  It's not as universal as English.  No, Spanish too.  I think they are strong here, the speakers.  When the Spaniards arrived, they didn't conquer Quechua with war.  Only diplomatically.  Diplomatically, through evangelization.  Because the Quechua are good warriors.  They set good traps.  They don't have good weapons.  But they have good strategies.  Suddenly, they set a trap.  You come and they kill you in silence.  So the Spaniards were dying.  First, the Spaniards killed a lot of Mayan people.  Because they deceived them.  First, they made alliances.  For example, your father is from Spain.  We are the Mayans.  But you are going to ally with him, the Spaniard.  To finish with my people.  It's an alliance with him to finish this.  But when they finished with me,  they are going to finish with you because he is going to ally with someone else.  He betrayed them.  But the Quechua don't make alliances with anyone.  Only them.  They are alone.  And they are warriors.  So they said, no, we don't make alliances with anyone.  Come, Spaniards.  So they had to take the Quechua king as a hostage.  To Spain.  They captured him.  Because if they kill him, the others don't leave them alone.  So he arrived in Spain.  When he arrived, he didn't bow to the king.  He has a strong character.  And he asked the king why he didn't bow.  He said, I don't bow because I'm a king.  For the world, he wasn't a king.  But for his people, he was a king.  So that's why he couldn't bow.  He liked the king's attitude.  So they changed his chief.  With strategies.  And they gave him three bells.  The ones you put in churches.  He brought three bells.  And they started building churches in this region.  And that's how they conquered the Quechua.  This region is called Alta Verapaz.  Do you know?  The department.  Yes, the department.  But they changed the name.  Because before, it was known as the land of true peace.  Because the war ended.  The system of conquest was changed.  That's why they named it the land of true peace.  And the city of Carlos V.  Because the emperor Carlos V of Spain,  with that nickname,  was founded by Cob치n.  The city of Carlos V.  So before the conquistadors, Cob치n didn't exist.  Cob치n, no.  Only the Quechua people.  The Quechua people.  Yes, the Quechua people.  Not like Cob치n.  Very good.  They were different people.  And each people had their king.  Only in Guatemala,  there were 23 countries.  Many countries.  Each with its own authority.  And how big is this?  The farm?  We have 210 hectares.  210 hectares.  Very big.  But apart from that, we have another.  Another?  No, no, no. Not 210, sorry.  210 hectares we have of cardamom.  But not the farm.  Here, only here, we have 810 hectares.  Of area to work.  Yes.  Bigger.  We have 300 hectares of forest, like this one.  Look.  Oh, that's the forest.  That's the forest.  You can see the forest there.  How do you plant babies?  Up there?  No, here close.  Over there.  Oh, I can see.  Yes.  Look.  This is our forest.  These are the trees that are like this size.  Or bigger.  Can you see up there?  Far away.  Oh, far away.  From here, yes.  They are trees like this, but they are growing.  Now they are babies?  Yes, like this size.  Or a little more.  Oh, more.  Baby trees.  Baby trees.  I'm going to take a picture.  Can you see the house that is up there?  Yes.  Up there?  On the hill.  Yes, there are the baby trees.  Oh, close to me.  Yes?  I can see.  Yes.  The most important thing is the height.  From 1,200 to 1,800 meters above sea level,  a good coffee is grown.  It has a prolonged aftertaste, as we said there.  After two minutes, three minutes of drinking coffee,  you start to feel the taste.  You start to distinguish the flavor of the coffee.  Yes.  If it doesn't have a prolonged aftertaste,  you don't drink a good coffee.  Yes.  Very good.  We finished the tour.  Now we are going to taste coffee.  Perfect.  Yes.  My favorite part.  Yes, yes.  Very good.  After the tour, I go to a testing area  and I'm able to taste all these different coffees.  Even though, like I said, I'm not much of a coffee drinker,  it was really great to be able to taste these beans  that I saw growing and get to understand  these Guatemalan highlands and the Quechua  to a higher extent.  My breakfast.  Yes.  My breakfast.  Breakfast.  Yes.  We are processing it for Asia.  For Asia.  Korea, Taiwan, and Japan.  Is that it?  This is a specialty coffee.  Barbarous.  They don't sell it in the United States?  No, no, it's not typical.  No.  How much for these?  How much?  If you want, you can pay me $20.  I can give it to you as a gift.  Do you want change?  Yes.  Thank you.  Have a good trip.  You too.  Have a nice trip.  Thank you.  Have a good trip.  Thank you.
