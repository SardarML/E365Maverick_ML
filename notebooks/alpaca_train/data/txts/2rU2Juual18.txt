[00:00:00 -> 00:00:19]  Hi, my name is Scott Naismith. I'm a landscape painter. This tutorial is about colour. Now
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:25]  colour use is of massive importance in my paintings and it's of a massive importance
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:31]  to know the theory about colour before you try and attempt to paint or design anything
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:37]  in colour. Every mark that you put on a design or you put onto canvas has three elements
[00:00:37 -> 00:00:45]  to it that make up that colour. It has a hue, it has a saturation and it has a tonal value.
[00:00:45 -> 00:00:55]  So let's take the first of those, hue. Hues are all the basic primary and secondary colours
[00:00:55 -> 00:01:01]  that make up the rainbow. They are the colours that make up light. They are just wavelengths
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:09]  of white light. The primaries, yellow, red, blue, make up in the transitions of those
[00:01:09 -> 00:01:15]  primaries the secondaries which are a mixture of two of the primaries. The secondaries being
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:24]  orange, purple and green. Now this rainbow of colour can be presented as a wheel. One
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:32]  colour wavelength at the end joined onto the beginning creates a wheel. Now what this wheel
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:39]  does is it allows us to understand the balance of colour so that we as artists and designers
[00:01:39 -> 00:01:49]  can use a harmonious colour derived from theories about this colour wheel. The most important
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:57]  thing to know about the colour wheel is what colours are opposite each other. These opposite
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:03]  colours contrast each other and are also called complementary colours. Tertiary colours are
[00:02:03 -> 00:02:09]  made up of three primary colours. Tertiary colours are not represented on the outside
[00:02:09 -> 00:02:16]  of the colour wheel but what we must be able to do is identify where in the colour wheel
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:25]  a tertiary colour's hue lies. For example this warm brown here can be placed just between orange,
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:33]  red and red on the colour wheel. Saturation is how pure the hue is. To understand saturation
[00:02:33 -> 00:02:41]  we must be able to understand how to desaturate a hue. To desaturate a hue you need to add
[00:02:41 -> 00:02:50]  a complementary colour. You mustn't think of desaturating a hue as adding grey. Even
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:56]  though we're greying out the colour we're not adding grey. I cannot stress enough how
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:04]  important this concept is. The main issue a lot of amateurs have with their colour use is the
[00:03:04 -> 00:03:09]  greying out of colour, the deadening of the colour. You've probably heard a million times don't use
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:17]  black but at the same time don't use a grey that you've just used white and black to mix a grey.
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:26]  Try to be a little bit more creative with the use of colour to create your unsaturated colours.
[00:03:26 -> 00:03:33]  I've got a quick demonstration of how two complementary colours can work. Often complementary
[00:03:33 -> 00:03:42]  colours side by side can jar together. They don't really look right together. You've probably heard
[00:03:42 -> 00:03:49]  the term red and green should never be seen. Often the two colours right side by side can be
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:57]  off-putting but to separate them somehow can work. We can separate them by the absence of colour which
[00:03:57 -> 00:04:06]  is a grey, a neutral colour. A grey, a black or a white. If we look at the work of Matisse you can
[00:04:06 -> 00:04:15]  do some research on the Matisse piece The Snail. Towards the end of Matisse's life,
[00:04:15 -> 00:04:23]  Henri Matisse, he produced some cut paper collages and on The Snail he uses black and
[00:04:23 -> 00:04:28]  white combined with colours, saturated colours from all around the colour wheel. What he was
[00:04:28 -> 00:04:36]  trying to do was separate those colours with the use of black and white. So I'm going to use purple
[00:04:36 -> 00:04:42]  and it's a blue-purple and I'm going to complement it with a slightly orangey-yellow.
[00:04:42 -> 00:04:50]  So now I can show you what happens when these two colours mix.
[00:04:50 -> 00:05:10]  So what's happening here is that the two complementary colours when mixed together
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:18]  are giving us this grey neutral colour. Using the neutral colour which is mixed from the two
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:27]  colours involved is very important to keep in mind. So when you have a blue that you want to
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:36]  calm down a little and desaturate, you want to use a little bit of orange or a colour which is
[00:05:36 -> 00:05:43]  based on the orange part of the colour wheel like a burnt sienna. So what I've done there is just use
[00:05:43 -> 00:05:48]  two complementary colours and then when they mix together they create the grey. By surrounding
[00:05:48 -> 00:05:55]  saturated colours with grey it gives me what is known as a contrast of saturations. If we go back
[00:05:55 -> 00:06:00]  to the work of Henri Matisse, Matisse was considered as being revolutionary in his colour
[00:06:00 -> 00:06:06]  use. He was one of the founding artists of the movement of Fauvism. Fauvism deriving from the
[00:06:06 -> 00:06:14]  word wild beasts and there were wild beasts of their colour use and they used non-literal colour
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:22]  but the colour was all based on theories and balance. Now they used very saturated colour and
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:29]  the controlled use of saturated colour is very important. You can't just fire saturated colour
[00:06:29 -> 00:06:37]  onto a canvas or a design without consideration of what is being read next to. If you've ever
[00:06:37 -> 00:06:42]  wondered why the saturated colours or really bright colours look great in a black background
[00:06:42 -> 00:06:50]  or look great in a white background, it's because it's being read with a balance to something that
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:56]  doesn't have, that has the least saturation. So saturated colours combined with unsaturated
[00:06:56 -> 00:07:05]  colours gives the saturated colours a little bit of a stage to perform on. Something's only hot
[00:07:05 -> 00:07:10]  when it's compared to something that's colder and it's the same with colour, it's the same with
[00:07:10 -> 00:07:16]  painting. And this is what Matisse told us. Matisse was working with colours from all around
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:23]  the colour wheel and high saturations and as soon as he combined it with grey, blacks and whites he
[00:07:23 -> 00:07:30]  was able to then stop bombarding the viewer with all this colour information and give a balance,
[00:07:30 -> 00:07:38]  a balance of saturations. The concept of complementary colours creating grey provides
[00:07:38 -> 00:07:45]  you with a way of creating those greys to break up your saturated colours. I've got this painting
[00:07:45 -> 00:07:53]  here that I produced recently and it's all about this theory. This is all about the complementary
[00:07:53 -> 00:07:59]  colours of blue and orange and those blue and oranges are separated a lot of the time. We don't
[00:07:59 -> 00:08:10]  see the saturated blues right next to the saturated orange. The most saturated blues
[00:08:10 -> 00:08:15]  are in this section here, the most saturated oranges are here but there's grey which stands
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:24]  in between those. So what's quite important sometimes is that we understand that you can't
[00:08:25 -> 00:08:30]  always put saturated complementary colours right next to each other. If you look at some of the
[00:08:30 -> 00:08:38]  work of Matisse and others including some influenced artists by Matisse such as Rothko,
[00:08:38 -> 00:08:46]  it's not a case of creating a vibrancy through putting one complementary colour right next to
[00:08:46 -> 00:08:52]  another. A lot of the time in Matisse's paintings if you look closely he'll separate those polar
[00:08:52 -> 00:08:59]  opposite colours using a black, using white, using a grey and it creates a barrier between
[00:08:59 -> 00:09:05]  the two so that we can read them separately. Thanks for watching the video there's going to
