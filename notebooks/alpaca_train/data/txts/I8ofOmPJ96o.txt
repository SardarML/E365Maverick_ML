[00:00:00 -> 00:00:03]  Happy Martin Luther King Jr. Day!
[00:00:03 -> 00:00:07]  This is a U.S. national holiday in case you didn't know.
[00:00:07 -> 00:00:12]  And do you know what Martin Luther King Jr. did for this country?
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:15]  He fought for civil rights.
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:18]  And that's on your civics test, so I hope you know it.
