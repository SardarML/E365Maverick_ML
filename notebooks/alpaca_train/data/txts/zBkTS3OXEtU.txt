[00:00:00 -> 00:00:14]  Okay, everybody. Well, welcome. This is going to be a really, really fun phase. I've been
[00:00:14 -> 00:00:19]  looking forward to this for quite some time. This is inking, and inking is a very broad
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:27]  subject. It's a subject that encompasses, you know, brush, quill, ballpoint pen, and
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:31]  it can be also Sumi brush inking. We could do calligraphic brush inking. There's all
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:37]  kinds of ways to do inking, and inking's been a very popular medium for centuries. Extremely
[00:00:37 -> 00:00:42]  popular towards the end of the 1800s when you had people like Joseph Clement Cole. Some
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:50]  of my favorites, Franklin Booth, Montgomery Flagg, Edwin Austin Abbey. We get into more
[00:00:50 -> 00:00:54]  modern like Frazetta and Wrightson and all these guys. So, I love traditional inking.
[00:00:55 -> 00:00:58]  I'm going to go through some samples just to kind of get you inspired and excited
[00:00:58 -> 00:01:05]  about this medium. We're going to start with the most simple of the three tools we'll be
[00:01:05 -> 00:01:08]  using, which is ballpoint pen. And then we'll move to quill, and then we'll move to brush,
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:13]  and then we'll marry the two together, and we'll have a nice understanding of the value of inking.
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:16]  Inking is really a calligraphic medium. It's also a very unforgiving medium. One of the
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:21]  most unforgiving you can't erase, similar to watercolor or some of the other ones.
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:28]  And so, it cultivates a directness in the way you work, a design on the fly kind of calligraphy
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:34]  that you couldn't really put in place that many other ways that I can think of. So, this is a
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:38]  really wonderful opportunity. It's a training medium. The medium, I kind of liken it to Latin
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:43]  because it's kind of a dead language, but it's a very helpful language. So, I see very few people
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:49]  teaching it anymore. I see very few people teaching it well, anyway, in that old traditional manner.
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:54]  So, my goal will be to bring to you about 30 hours of inking demonstration
[00:01:55 -> 00:01:59]  of everything that I can think of that I've learned over the last 30 years or so.
[00:02:00 -> 00:02:03]  So, now, inking is not my primary medium, but it is one that I use a lot. I use it as a sketch
[00:02:03 -> 00:02:08]  medium. I use it to explore design, vignetting, things like that. So, if you look at this page
[00:02:08 -> 00:02:13]  right here, we've got a little architectural vignette up here in the corner. And how you end
[00:02:13 -> 00:02:18]  this drawing, vignette means to prematurely end a drawing in an attractive manner. You may remember
[00:02:18 -> 00:02:22]  me saying that in some other phase. But you can see there's a weather to go with or against the
[00:02:22 -> 00:02:27]  form, crosshatching, deep crosshatching to make it look more like a deep shadow or spreading the
[00:02:27 -> 00:02:31]  lines apart. And we'll talk about this in a minute when I demonstrate the basic use of this tool.
[00:02:32 -> 00:02:35]  Right now, I'm just showing you examples that will hopefully get you excited. We got a little
[00:02:35 -> 00:02:40]  anatomy study down here. So, this is a vignette page with a smattering. It doesn't have a subject
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:44]  to it. I think it was just demonstrating in class. So, I'm going to run through these pretty quick
[00:02:44 -> 00:02:50]  so we can stay on point. I've got a lot to show you. So, yeah. And now, here is freehand perspective
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:57]  where we're actually doing little vignettes of architectural, you know, castles and, you know,
[00:02:57 -> 00:03:01]  more Papua New Guinea type, you know. And then over here, we have like France or some street scene in
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:07]  Europe, China down here. And you're just freehanding your vanishing points perspective. So, you're
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:13]  learning how to sketch perspective without using it so technically, right? And that's something
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:16]  that's very difficult. Sometimes, you have to come to that through technical training in perspective
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:21]  first, then sketching or vice back and forth between those two because it does help to have a
[00:03:21 -> 00:03:25]  formal understanding of perspective. And you can go over and you can take Eric's and some of my
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:29]  dad's classes to learn more about perspective. And it'll be kind of interthread or threaded through
[00:03:29 -> 00:03:34]  a lot of these phases. So, these are the ones I've kind of grabbed out of my flat file. And they're
[00:03:34 -> 00:03:38]  just examples of various things that I sketch when I'm studying or when I'm trying to memorize
[00:03:38 -> 00:03:42]  information. It could be anatomical information like the leg up here or the back of this guy
[00:03:42 -> 00:03:47]  standing here. There's probably an invented figure here, an invented head down here. So, it allows me
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:53]  to see what kind of retained knowledge I've gained from other phases, from other disciplines that I've
[00:03:53 -> 00:03:58]  studied, anatomical with charcoal, anatomical with ballpoint pen. I mean, there's lots of ways you can
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:04]  approach studying this stuff. And we're trying to show you as many solid examples of that as possible.
[00:04:04 -> 00:04:09]  Here's an example of a page. Again, we've got some dragons in here. I could be drawing anything
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:13]  from dragons to anatomy. A lot of times you'll see anatomy being a common theme because I'm
[00:04:13 -> 00:04:16]  very interested in it and it's one of my favorite areas. But you also see lots of little head
[00:04:16 -> 00:04:21]  inventions, just little heads that I'm making up. It could be a character for a comic, could be
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:25]  concepting. If you're a visual development artist or an artist that's going into storyboarding,
[00:04:25 -> 00:04:30]  it's a great medium, great thing to learn how to do. It'll help you in all areas, your oil painting,
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:36]  digital painting, anything. It's design. I think I did this one online as a Friday Night Live and
[00:04:36 -> 00:04:41]  it was a really cool pen and ink sketch of a Frazetta. And I did it, yeah, it was, you know,
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:45]  did it while I was chatting and talking to people and stuff. So, it's got a really nice feel though,
[00:04:45 -> 00:04:50]  a nice vignette feel. It's not exactly like Frazettas, but it is got a lot of that Frazetta
[00:04:50 -> 00:04:54]  feel, flavor. It's one of my favorites for design, calligraphy, idealization of form.
[00:04:54 -> 00:05:02]  Here's another page of Frazettas, vignettes of arms, legs, backs, hands, learning musculature,
[00:05:02 -> 00:05:06]  learning how to exaggerate musculature, learning how to accentuate, doing it in a very direct
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:10]  medium where you have to commit to your strokes, commit to what you're thinking, commit to what
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:15]  you're learning. And that's one thing that I think you'll find with ballpoint pen is it's an
[00:05:15 -> 00:05:21]  incredibly poignant and deliberate medium where we have to premeditate our moves, similar to
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:25]  a very strategic type medium, I would say. Something like playing chess,
[00:05:25 -> 00:05:28]  where you're thinking about your moves, you're countering your moves, you're thinking about
[00:05:28 -> 00:05:32]  what's going to happen next because you don't have the ability to erase it like we do in lots
[00:05:32 -> 00:05:35]  of other mediums. So, that's a little smattering there. And then I'm just going to go through some
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:42]  various sketchbooks. Again, more Frazetta, really nice page of legs and arms, just a little made-up
[00:05:42 -> 00:05:48]  figure, you know, just kind of, again, doodling. This is just a normal sketchbook of mine. You
[00:05:48 -> 00:05:53]  might see a little bit of everything in here from, again, and this is an invented page on the
[00:05:53 -> 00:05:56]  right, Frazetta on the left, probably warmed up with Frazetta and then did some little made-up
[00:05:56 -> 00:06:01]  figures. This is my dad's sketchbooking class. I took it, and this will dovetail nicely with
[00:06:01 -> 00:06:07]  sketchbooking phase. And this is kind of, I may or may not do part of that, but my dad, Lucas and
[00:06:07 -> 00:06:12]  Eric all did some, and I'll be doing kind of the same thing in this phase here. So, maybe I will,
[00:06:12 -> 00:06:17]  maybe I won't, but you'll get my version of it in this class. So, this is, I think he gave us a
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:22]  bunch of reference. It was on World War II, and our job was to create a vignette page out of it.
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:26]  So, to take, you know, five, ten pieces of reference and create some kind of page, sketch
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:30]  page, that had a theme. And how you designed it was up to you, how you did it. So, this is just
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:34]  kind of an example of what I came up with. And again, it was just done in class, just playing
[00:06:34 -> 00:06:41]  around. This was a demo in, I think, class as well for Ballpoint Pen, you know, some invented heads.
[00:06:41 -> 00:06:46]  Also, another thing you'll be seeing today, these are some examples of things you will be seeing me
[00:06:46 -> 00:06:52]  kind of do, are these, you know, just again, this was a photo I had, and I kind of invented a balloon
[00:06:52 -> 00:06:56]  up in the top, just to kind of sensationalize, make it a little bit more romantic. And I just
[00:06:56 -> 00:07:00]  had some fun with it, okay? So, when sketchbooking is a fun medium, it's a medium where you just
[00:07:00 -> 00:07:06]  explore. Here's a little invented figure, and very nice, got a great calligraphy. It has a little bit
[00:07:06 -> 00:07:11]  of a Claire Windling look to it, or maybe even a mooka. And the whimsical line in here, and how
[00:07:11 -> 00:07:15]  I'm designing around the shadows and within the shadows, rather than just filling it in generically,
[00:07:15 -> 00:07:21]  I'm letting my strokes create a very calligraphic, lyrical quality to them, which gives a really
[00:07:21 -> 00:07:26]  nice aesthetic feel, which means it looks good. And again, whenever we draw anything, I don't care
[00:07:26 -> 00:07:30]  whether it's this hand indication here, where the knuckles, you got an index finger, and then the
[00:07:30 -> 00:07:36]  rest of the hand, very Bridgman, very Frazetta. So, I'm drawing upon my knowledge from those areas,
[00:07:36 -> 00:07:41]  bringing it into this drawing. I could have some Riley rhythms in there, all kinds of, you know,
[00:07:41 -> 00:07:49]  some, like I said, mooka, maybe some lumas coming in. This stuff is so amazingly varied.
[00:07:49 -> 00:07:55]  This is a Dean Cornwell vignette demo. Just a little invented head. Here's another theme where
[00:07:55 -> 00:08:00]  I think we had witches or warlocks or something, and it was a vignette page I created in my dad's
[00:08:00 -> 00:08:04]  class for that. And it may be, you know, each one of these might be a little 10, 15-minute sketch.
[00:08:05 -> 00:08:10]  Some Mad Max stuff, where I was just sketching cars and guys from that movie. A little bit of
[00:08:10 -> 00:08:16]  Phil Hale in here. I'm another big fan of him. I love his design sense. Phil's kind of a little
[00:08:16 -> 00:08:21]  more obscure. He's a comic artist, but also can hold his own in almost anything. So, anyway,
[00:08:21 -> 00:08:23]  that's kind of this one. I'm not going to go through too much more of that, because some
[00:08:23 -> 00:08:29]  of the exercises for today are in that book as well. A couple other ones I want to show you.
[00:08:29 -> 00:08:34]  One of them is an anatomy sketchbook, and this is one that I use primarily only for studying anatomy,
[00:08:34 -> 00:08:41]  this particular sketchbook. So, we'll have, again, some Frazetta stuff in there.
[00:08:42 -> 00:08:45]  We'll have, I'm trying to think here. I kind of bookmarked the ones that were more inking,
[00:08:45 -> 00:08:49]  because there's a lot of graphite in here, which is not a problem. But, you know, some of them will
[00:08:49 -> 00:08:53]  just be arms like this, where I'm studying from Bridgman, and I'm going in, and rather than doing
[00:08:53 -> 00:08:57]  it in charcoal or maybe graphite, I'm going through and doing it with ballpoint pen. So,
[00:08:57 -> 00:09:02]  you're going to be able to see a lot of uses for ballpoint pen. Pen is an explorative medium for me.
[00:09:02 -> 00:09:07]  I memorize information with it. I design calligraphy with it. I build my dexterity with
[00:09:07 -> 00:09:13]  it. I develop a more keen eye and sense of knowledge with it. So, it's a very, very beautiful
[00:09:13 -> 00:09:18]  medium to study in. Some more Frazetta legs, and again, I try different pens. Some of these
[00:09:18 -> 00:09:24]  are Zebra. Some of these are just, you know, like Bic or even Paper Mate. They're just simple pens.
[00:09:24 -> 00:09:28]  Like, this pen is just a standard pen you would use in high school, and you can do some beautiful
[00:09:28 -> 00:09:32]  stuff with it. We have more fancy pens, and we'll go through pens in a moment to show you
[00:09:32 -> 00:09:36]  all the different varieties and stuff we had to look forward to. So, again, just different pens.
[00:09:36 -> 00:09:41]  This is a little Micron pen, Burnt Sienna, kind of a brown. I like sketching in that a lot of times.
[00:09:42 -> 00:09:45]  Whether it's blue, brown, black, it doesn't really matter, but I have certain ones that
[00:09:45 -> 00:09:50]  I have an affinity for that I enjoy. So, I use those pens, and you'll find your own.
[00:09:50 -> 00:09:53]  I'll show you the ones I use, but that does not mean that you need to go out and
[00:09:53 -> 00:10:00]  always use those or race around trying to use that stuff. So, what would we use ballpoint pen
[00:10:00 -> 00:10:05]  for? Well, we use it, again, like I said, to explore ideas. So, let's say I'm in my sketchbook, and I'm looking
[00:10:06 -> 00:10:11]  at trying to draw some ideas for maybe a character for a comic or a concept for a
[00:10:11 -> 00:10:15]  movie I'm working on that has centaurs in it or something. Now, you may not be a concept, you may
[00:10:15 -> 00:10:20]  be a fine artist, or it doesn't matter. You know, who cares if you're concepting for DreamWorks or
[00:10:20 -> 00:10:26]  you're concepting for a fine art show coming up on Western art or something, or, you know,
[00:10:26 -> 00:10:32]  landscapes. It's all interrelated. So, these are some cool little Micron sketches on gray
[00:10:32 -> 00:10:38]  paper where I used whiteout, you know, like cheap whiteout that you get for high school, and I went
[00:10:38 -> 00:10:41]  around and I highlighted it to pop certain things forward, and that's just a little another little
[00:10:41 -> 00:10:46]  sketch technique that you can play around with. It's really wonderful, and you'll see a number of
[00:10:46 -> 00:10:51]  these that I was doing because I love centaurs. I like horses, and I like anatomy, human anatomy. So,
[00:10:51 -> 00:10:56]  I was kind of building off of Heinrich Klee, who was also a wonderful inker that did a lot
[00:10:56 -> 00:11:02]  of whimsical subject matter, lyrical. He was also kind of a satirist. Frazetta borrowed a lot from
[00:11:02 -> 00:11:09]  him, his concepts and stuff. So, just another neat guy to think about. This is a cool page
[00:11:09 -> 00:11:14]  of dinosaurs and heads and, you know, I mean, I've got everything from, I think,
[00:11:15 -> 00:11:22]  Jim Buscema, who's a comic artist, to some Jurassic Park stuff mixed with some mooka,
[00:11:22 -> 00:11:28]  or some maybe Alma Tadema mixed with, I think, this was a Bridgman little vignette down here
[00:11:28 -> 00:11:33]  with some Claire Windling. So, I mean, in this page alone, you have so much learning happening.
[00:11:33 -> 00:11:38]  I'm learning how to design like Cornwell. I'm learning how to take some of the stuff I like
[00:11:38 -> 00:11:42]  from Claire Windling. I'm inventing figures using the information I'm learning from that. I'm coming
[00:11:42 -> 00:11:46]  over here and designing this T-Rex, which is more of an, you know, I've got to work my animal
[00:11:46 -> 00:11:51]  anatomy, but I start to think about, you know, joints and, you know, all this stuff that we
[00:11:51 -> 00:11:54]  learn in other things. So, everything's cross-platforming. Everything's moving in and out
[00:11:54 -> 00:11:58]  of each other. And that's the main thing we need to remember. You're going to see a lot of inking
[00:11:58 -> 00:12:02]  tutorials out there. You're going to see a lot of people telling you different things. Take them
[00:12:02 -> 00:12:06]  with a grain of salt. They're just springboards from which you to work off of. You know, I'll
[00:12:06 -> 00:12:11]  show you my technique, and it's going to differ from some other guy's technique or girl's technique,
[00:12:11 -> 00:12:14]  and you're just going to have to pick the ones that work best for you. But the main thing is,
[00:12:15 -> 00:12:20]  is that I'm showing you that this is a way that you learn, you memorize. So, sketching, you can
[00:12:20 -> 00:12:24]  take it anywhere. You can take it on a plane with you. You can have a ballpoint pen and a sketchpad
[00:12:24 -> 00:12:28]  with you anywhere you go. You can sketch people sitting at Starbucks. You can, I mean, you can do
[00:12:28 -> 00:12:32]  all kinds of wonderful things if you're disciplined enough and you just have the wherewithal to say,
[00:12:32 -> 00:12:37]  yeah, I'm going to go do that. So, anyway, a lot of this stuff is kind of redundant, just nice
[00:12:37 -> 00:12:43]  sketches. I'm going to be doing a ton of these for you today. So, rather than bore you with endless,
[00:12:43 -> 00:12:49]  you know, things like that, let's move on to materials. Now, material, paper-wise, you just
[00:12:49 -> 00:12:55]  saw as I was pulling out all those different sketches. I mean, there's toned paper. There's
[00:12:55 -> 00:12:59]  bristles. There's just sketch paper, general sketch paper, which could be any number of things.
[00:13:00 -> 00:13:05]  Don't worry about it. I mean, play around. Buy a bunch of different sketch pads. Buy a bunch of
[00:13:05 -> 00:13:14]  different papers. In the material aspect of the PDF for this, you'll have a list of maybe some
[00:13:14 -> 00:13:20]  general sources you can go to. One of them is jetpens.com, and they carry a lot of quill stuff,
[00:13:20 -> 00:13:26]  brush inking material, and we'll get into all that when we do quill and brush. Each one will
[00:13:26 -> 00:13:29]  be separated out, and I'll show you the particulars of each one of them, so I'm not going to get too
[00:13:29 -> 00:13:37]  far ahead of myself here. These little Micron pens, Micron .005. This is the burnt sienna ones,
[00:13:37 -> 00:13:45]  the brown ones, and they come in different, you know, there's a 01.005, which is smaller,
[00:13:45 -> 00:13:48]  and as you go up in the numbers, they get a little larger. So, I've got a couple different
[00:13:48 -> 00:13:52]  varieties there of that pen, which I'll use, and I'm just going to, you know, move through the
[00:13:52 -> 00:13:57]  different pens because each pen will make you draw a little differently, will handle the paper a
[00:13:57 -> 00:14:01]  little differently. So, it takes some experimenting. It takes some time to get really familiar with any
[00:14:01 -> 00:14:08]  medium. These are the Hi-Tec-C pens. I like them a lot. Their Pilot is the brand, Hi-Tec-C, and this
[00:14:08 -> 00:14:15]  is a .3 or an 03, and this is a .4. So, again, the numbers, as they get smaller, the tips get smaller,
[00:14:15 -> 00:14:18]  and as they get larger, they get a little bit thicker and a little bit different. So, you
[00:14:18 -> 00:14:23]  might want to try a bunch of varieties of those. You've got your normal Bic and Papermate. So,
[00:14:23 -> 00:14:29]  here's a FedEx Office, and that'll work fine. Here's a Papermate, doesn't matter. Any of those
[00:14:29 -> 00:14:34]  ballpoint pens that you used to use in high school to take notes with would be fine as well. Here's
[00:14:34 -> 00:14:39]  some pens that, here's a brush pen. So, it's a pen that has a little bit more calligraphic tip on it.
[00:14:39 -> 00:14:45]  I may do one drawing with that. This is not really, that kind of starts to branch into brush inking,
[00:14:45 -> 00:14:48]  and we don't want to really mix these up too much. Some of these just have different tips,
[00:14:48 -> 00:14:55]  like this is a wider, fatter tip pen. It's a Zebra, and it can be nice for laying in
[00:14:56 -> 00:14:59]  thicker areas in a sketch, depending on what kind of sketch look you're going for.
[00:14:59 -> 00:15:04]  Here's a technical drawing pen, and it's just really fine. Again, doesn't matter. There's a
[00:15:04 -> 00:15:07]  lot of great options out there, and then you have the ballpoint pens that are a little bit more,
[00:15:07 -> 00:15:15]  I don't know, fluid. Things like this Pentel Technica Hybrid, a fancy name for whatever,
[00:15:15 -> 00:15:21]  just sounds cool. But these ones will lay down ink a little bit thicker, a little bit more wet
[00:15:21 -> 00:15:27]  than, say, the Papermates and stuff like that. So, it really depends on kind of what you want,
[00:15:27 -> 00:15:33]  what you like, what you're into. These are all things that we have to just kind of play around
[00:15:33 -> 00:15:40]  with and explore. Now, I'm going to kind of use these little dots, these Staedtler sticky dots,
[00:15:40 -> 00:15:44]  like they're basically drafting dots, and it just helps keep your stuff down if you're doing like
[00:15:44 -> 00:15:46]  labors or tracings.
