[00:00:00 -> 00:00:08]  Hello, learners. Hope that you are keeping well. Today, we're going to look at superimposed
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:16]  and antecedent streams. I don't know why it's to be such a problem for many learners. They
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:23]  don't seem to identify the difference between the two and explain them. So I'll try today
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:30]  to emphasize the differences between these two so I can get my face out of this place
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:40]  and we can get going. Okay. So let's look at firstly the superimposed stream. All right.
[00:00:40 -> 00:00:48]  I can get my slides going. Yes, that's our superimposed drainage. All right. Now let's
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:56]  look at what happens here. If you look at the first little sketch here, you notice there's
[00:00:56 -> 00:01:08]  a ridge that has formed. Okay. And when we go to the second photograph or diagram rather,
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:18]  you will notice that layers of rock have formed over the ridge. Eventually, what actually
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:30]  happens is a river then forms on that landscape or layers of rock. Now, what actually happens
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:38]  here is that the river is younger than the surrounding landscape. Okay. That's one point
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:47]  you need to note. So there was a ridge, layers of rock formed, and then the river formed.
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:57]  The river then starts to erode the landscape. And as it continues, you notice it cuts right
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:07]  through. And eventually, it's going to reach this ridge. And it's going to erode through
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:14]  creating a sort of gap here. It cuts right through the ridge. Okay. But one thing we
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:24]  would notice is that if you look at the pattern of flow, it maintains that pattern of flow. All
[00:02:24 -> 00:02:31]  right. It doesn't change. That's what makes it superimposed. The stream still maintains that
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:39]  pattern of flow. It doesn't change. It just seems like the river was just placed on the landscape,
[00:02:39 -> 00:02:46]  and it doesn't follow the general direction of flow, you know, from altitude and from high to
[00:02:46 -> 00:02:56]  gentle. It just maintains its course. And that is your little explanation for your superimposed
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:04]  drainage. All right. We can see it here also in another diagram. There, the river, the ridges
[00:03:04 -> 00:03:15]  here, layers are formed. The river then forms. And eventually, it starts eroding through. It
[00:03:15 -> 00:03:24]  reaches the ridge, and it cuts through the ridge. But it still maintains its shape, making it a
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:33]  superimposed stream. All right. Now, let's just look at a little summary on that. We say,
[00:03:33 -> 00:03:44]  yeah, the landscape develops before the river. So, the river is younger. And as we said,
[00:03:44 -> 00:04:02]  the stream network displays a pattern that bears no relation to the relief of the landscape.
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:10]  It maintains its course as it flowed first. It eroded. But it maintains the same pattern
[00:04:10 -> 00:04:16]  and course. Eventually, as I said, it will cut through and then flow in gorges,
[00:04:16 -> 00:04:25]  cutting across those higher ridges. Okay? And this is your superimposed drainage.
[00:04:26 -> 00:04:33]  It's like the river, as I said, has been placed on top of the landscape. And as time goes by,
[00:04:33 -> 00:04:40]  it will erode the older underlying rocks, which are your ridges, etc. And it maintains
[00:04:40 -> 00:04:53]  its original course and is not affected by the older structures. Okay? And harder rocks. It
[00:04:53 -> 00:05:03]  maintains its course. A good example is the Val River, which is a superimposed drainage.
[00:05:03 -> 00:05:13]  All right. Let's go on. Let's now look at an antecedent stream. Okay? Now, if we look at the
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:21]  antecedent stream, and maybe I must get my highlighter here, or laser, you'll notice that
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:32]  the river existed. So, the river is older. Okay? And then there's a change in the landscape.
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:40]  It could be faulting. Can you see? A piece of rock has been uplifted. All right? And if the
[00:05:40 -> 00:05:48]  river has more erosive abilities compared to the upliftment, rate of upliftment, the river will
[00:05:48 -> 00:05:58]  erode, but it will erode in such a way that it will still maintain its course. All right? You
[00:05:58 -> 00:06:05]  can notice it's still maintaining its course. It doesn't change. But the fact is that the river
[00:06:05 -> 00:06:13]  is older, and then the landscape has adjusted, and the river erodes it to maintain its course.
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:19]  Okay? I'll show you another diagram. Can you see it here? There's the course of the river.
[00:06:20 -> 00:06:27]  Folding has happened, but the river cuts through and maintains it. Same thing with the faulting
[00:06:27 -> 00:06:36]  here. Can you see? The river flows. It flows in the same pattern. All right? Its original pattern,
[00:06:36 -> 00:06:41]  even if there's upliftment. Okay? So, let's look at a little summary on this.
[00:06:43 -> 00:06:45]  And let me get my pen down here.
[00:06:48 -> 00:07:01]  Or highlighter, rather. The river developed its course before the highland areas formed.
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:09]  That means the river is older. And after the river formed, then only we'll have things like
[00:07:09 -> 00:07:19]  warping, folding, faulting. An important point to note that if the rate of down cutting,
[00:07:19 -> 00:07:29]  that means downward erosion, all right, of the river is greater than the rate of upliftment,
[00:07:29 -> 00:07:38]  okay, then the river is able to maintain its pattern. So, the rate of down cutting,
[00:07:38 -> 00:07:44]  or downward erosion, must be greater than the rate of upliftment. It's cutting, all right,
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:55]  a gorge through the land that has been uplifted. So, just in summary, the superimposed is the
[00:07:55 -> 00:08:01]  youngest stream. Landscapes have developed. And then the river forms. But it cuts through
[00:08:01 -> 00:08:07]  the landscapes and through the ridges and maintains its pattern. The river is younger.
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:13]  In antecedent, the river was there, right? It's older. And what has actually happened is that
[00:08:13 -> 00:08:21]  the river then, if there's upliftment, the river then erodes the uplifted surfaces,
[00:08:21 -> 00:08:27]  if the rate of down cutting is more than upliftment, and it maintains its course.
[00:08:28 -> 00:08:33]  I hope that makes it a little clearer for you, learners. All the best.
