 More and more organizations are using cloud-managed database services for improved agility and  lower costs.  This is great for everyone, but it means big changes and more work for our security teams.  Improving end-user freedom and flexibility can expose your database to additional vulnerabilities.  Cloud services are not fail-safe and operate on a shared responsibility model.  Ultimately, you are responsible for protecting your data.  It's easy to lose sight of new data repositories spun up in the cloud, and this lack of visibility  makes pinpointing the location of sensitive data a challenge and a security risk.  Manually attempting to gain visibility into data repositories to apply policies for security  and compliance is time-consuming and can be susceptible to errors.  Every moment a database is unprotected, the risk of malicious access and data theft rises.  Imperver Cloud Data Security dramatically simplifies securing your data repositories  in AWS, enabling your security team to keep up with the speed of DevOps.  Within minutes, Imperver Cloud Data Security automatically finds and classifies sensitive  data in managed database services.  We continuously monitor who is accessing your data and will notify your team of policy-violating  behavior that puts your data at risk.  This means that your sensitive data can only be accessed by your approved users.  Because Imperver Cloud Data Security is SaaS, you don't get a project, just a solution.  There's nothing to install and nothing to deploy.  Without the need for AWS expertise, you'll get data discovery, classification, policy  creation and reporting straight out of the box.  Thousands of our customers trust Imperver to protect their data.  We're here to help at imperver.com  www.imperver.com
