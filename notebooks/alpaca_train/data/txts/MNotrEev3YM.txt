[00:00:00 -> 00:00:12]  Greetings and welcome to New Planet School. Today we're going to talk about deliberate
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:18]  practice, which is a set of strategies to help you get to be really good at things.
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:25]  But first, before we get started, I want to ask you a few questions just to get you thinking about
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:31]  a few things. The first question I want you to think about is, are there a few things that you'd
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:37]  like to be better at? Think about that for a minute and itemize those in your mind. What would
[00:00:37 -> 00:00:44]  you like to be good at? Second question is, for some of these things, does it feel like you have
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:48]  no talent for these things? Like if you wanted to get to be pretty good at these, it might actually
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:56]  be fairly difficult. And last question, do you think that your skill level for these things is
[00:00:56 -> 00:01:03]  due to nature? That is, you're born with these talents. If you don't have them, then you know,
[00:01:03 -> 00:01:09]  it's too bad. Or that it's really nurture that matters, you know, who your coaches are and how
[00:01:09 -> 00:01:15]  much you practice and so forth. What are your thoughts on that? Think about these questions
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:22]  for a minute. And think also about some of the most talented people that you know of. Think about
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:29]  musicians like Yo-Yo Ma, theoretical physicists like Albert Einstein, novelists like Ernest
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:36]  Hemingway, athletes like Michael Jordan. These are people that are incredibly talented, aren't they?
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:43]  But science has some tips for you to help you become very talented as well. And that's what
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:49]  this video is about. I'll give you a quick preview here just so you can see what the basic ideas are.
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:55]  And what science actually shows is that what your skill level is in these things that you'd
[00:01:55 -> 00:02:01]  like to be good at is determined by both nature and nurture. It's not one or the other, it's some
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:07]  mixture. And it greatly depends on you and what you'd like to do, which one plays the largest role.
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:15]  The second thing that science shows is that you need a great deal of discipline, because the most
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:21]  important thing that you can do is practice, practice, and practice. There's really no other
[00:02:21 -> 00:02:25]  way. And experiments have been done observing people to become experts, and that is in fact
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:34]  how they do it. But it's not that you practice, it's how you practice. Practice alone is not enough.
[00:02:34 -> 00:02:40]  What you really need to do when you practice is focus on your weaknesses and place a priority
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:47]  on thinking about what those are and removing those weaknesses. It's how you practice, not how
[00:02:47 -> 00:02:56]  much you practice. And finally, feedback is crucial. You need to have some a coach or some way of
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:02]  measuring, some metric for measuring your progress so that you can watch it happen, and if it's not
[00:03:02 -> 00:03:09]  happening, you can go back and change it. And this is all scientifically based. This area is an area
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:17]  of active research right now. I have a few papers that you can go look up. These are ones I could
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:22]  actually get off of the internet, so you can go get them too. Here's a paper that was in the
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:27]  Psychological Review in 1993 on the role of deliberate practice in the acquisition of expert
[00:03:27 -> 00:03:32]  performance. So what they do is they watch experts like Michael Jordan, like Ernest Hemingway, these
[00:03:32 -> 00:03:39]  sort of peoples, and what they find is that many characteristics once believed to reflect innate
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:46]  talent are actually a result of intense practice for about 10 years. And if you intensely practice
[00:03:46 -> 00:03:54]  for about 10 years, you're going to put in about 10,000 hours of practice, and only then will you
[00:03:54 -> 00:04:00]  become an expert like a Michael Jordan or like a Yo-Yo Ma. Before that, you're going to be basically
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:09]  one of the rest of us. Here's another paper by actually some of the same authors in the context
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:14]  of business, and what they argue is new research shows that outstanding performance is a product
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:24]  of deliberate practice and coaching, not of talent or skill. Here's another one from the Harvard
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:31]  Business Review written by a coach discussing managing yourself, and what does he say? Compete
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:39]  with yourself, demand relentless feedback, and that is how the best get to be the best and even better.
[00:04:39 -> 00:04:47]  Now you might ask, is this agreed upon by all scientists? And I have to admit in all honesty
[00:04:47 -> 00:04:53]  that it is not totally agreed upon by all scientists, but for the following reason. Here's
[00:04:53 -> 00:04:58]  a paper that's just come out on the subject of deliberate practice, and they asked the question,
[00:04:58 -> 00:05:06]  is that all that it takes to become an expert? And what they argue here is that no, that's not all it
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:12]  takes. They might not agree completely with this statement, but they do agree that deliberate
[00:05:12 -> 00:05:20]  practice is an important part, but there is some nature part. There is some innate skills that we
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:25]  do have. So these are some of the scientific papers. You can go find these and read them in
[00:05:25 -> 00:05:31]  detail, but let's just look at what they basically say. They look at this concept of talent, and what
[00:05:31 -> 00:05:38]  is talent? In the dictionary, talent refers to aptitudes or skills that are natural. Those are
[00:05:38 -> 00:05:44]  the things that come to us just basically by birth. So what are some examples of these? There's a lot
[00:05:44 -> 00:05:51]  of examples. One of them could be perfect musical pitch, which occurs in about 1 in 10,000 people.
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:59]  Pretty rare. IQ is an example of an innate talent. They say that the average IQ of a physicist is
[00:05:59 -> 00:06:05]  about 130, and that would be about 2.1 percent of the population. That would be another natural
[00:06:05 -> 00:06:13]  aptitude. The ability to be very creative and achieve high levels of advanced education. Only
[00:06:13 -> 00:06:20]  three people have ever won the fiction Pulitzer Prize twice. And then, of course, there's the
[00:06:20 -> 00:06:26]  obvious one is physical superiority. For example, how tall you are. The average height in the NBA
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:33]  is about 6'7". And so these are these are some examples of natural aptitudes and skills. Some
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:40]  of us have these in more or less degree. But what people started asking is this question. What are
[00:06:40 -> 00:06:48]  the variations? Is that all that you need? So here's an example of two basketball teams, the
[00:06:48 -> 00:06:57]  Utah Jazz and the Chicago Bulls. And what I plotted here is the number of players on this axis, the y
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:05]  axis. And then I plotted the height in inches on the x axis. And remember that the average height
[00:07:05 -> 00:07:11]  of an NBA player is about 79 inches, which is about right here. And that's pretty tall. 6'7 is
[00:07:11 -> 00:07:16]  pretty tall. The players that are out here are incredibly tall. They're approaching about seven
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:22]  feet tall. But interestingly, there's a large variation. The ones on this end are barely over
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:29]  six feet. Sometimes they're not even over six feet. There's a very large variation. So saying
[00:07:29 -> 00:07:35]  that being a great basketball player is due to height, certainly that is partly true. But there's
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:44]  a very large variation in heights in NBA basketball teams. And if you look even closer, some people
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:51]  seem to do pretty well without such talents. One Basketball Hall of Fame winner, Calvin Murphy, was
[00:07:51 -> 00:07:59]  actually below the average height of an American, which is about 5'10". If you look at orchestras
[00:07:59 -> 00:08:06]  in the United States, about 30,000 people should have perfect pitch according to that estimate. But
[00:08:06 -> 00:08:11]  there are about 1,200 symphonies in the United States with about 100 members. So there are about
[00:08:11 -> 00:08:19]  120,000 musicians that play in symphonies around the United States. Clearly not all of them have
[00:08:19 -> 00:08:29]  perfect pitch, maybe just a few of them. So clearly that's not so important. And one great example of
[00:08:29 -> 00:08:36]  achieving high levels of education, Hemingway, a Nobel Prize winner for literature, made it through
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:44]  high school, but that was the limit of his education. Of course, some sports are highly selective. If
[00:08:44 -> 00:08:51]  you happen to be a gymnast, your average height is about 5'5", and the height of a male jockey is
[00:08:51 -> 00:08:59]  very short at 5'3". So sports is an example where these innate qualities tend to be more selective,
[00:08:59 -> 00:09:05]  but in many scenarios they simply don't matter. There's a large variation. Let's look at those
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:10]  Pulitzer Prize winners. Booth Tarkington went to Princeton, two honorary degrees from that
[00:09:10 -> 00:09:16]  Ivy League school. John Updike went to Harvard. He became an author. He graduated summa cum laude
[00:09:16 -> 00:09:25]  in English. But the third winner is William Faulkner, who did not go to an Ivy League school
[00:09:25 -> 00:09:30]  and could barely scrape by a grade of a D in English. So there are very large variations.
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:37]  And so what is the common trait that these people tend to have? That's what people wanted to know.
[00:09:37 -> 00:09:44]  So throughout this video, I'll bring in some quotes from what I think are some very famous
[00:09:44 -> 00:09:49]  and talented people and see what they say. So let's start off with Paul Coffey, who's the
[00:09:49 -> 00:09:57]  Canadian hockey player. And what does he say? Nobody is a natural. You work hard to get good,
[00:09:57 -> 00:10:03]  and you work harder to get better. And this is a theme that you see with people who are very good.
[00:10:03 -> 00:10:09]  They work very hard at what they do. They're extremely focused. So what the science says,
[00:10:09 -> 00:10:15]  when you go back to this deliberate practice, is that you need to practice and you need to
[00:10:15 -> 00:10:20]  do it deliberately. So what does that mean? We all know what practice means. It's basically
[00:10:20 -> 00:10:28]  repeated exercise or performance of an activity or skill. Now, if you're like me, I've been typing
[00:10:28 -> 00:10:33]  for many, many, many, many years. Too many years that I even want to mention. But I'm terrible at
[00:10:33 -> 00:10:41]  typing. I do it repeatedly, and I simply don't get any better at it. That's where the second
[00:10:41 -> 00:10:46]  part comes in. And that, in a sense, is the more important part. It's the deliberate part of this,
[00:10:46 -> 00:10:51]  is you have to do it consciously and intentionally. You've got to pay attention to what you're doing.
[00:10:51 -> 00:10:57]  It's not that you practice, it's how you practice. You have to do it in a fully considered way. You
[00:10:57 -> 00:11:02]  got to pay attention to what you're doing. Don't be impulsive about that. Control your practice,
[00:11:02 -> 00:11:11]  and that is what leads to success. So let's see what Ray Bradbury has to say about that.
[00:11:11 -> 00:11:17]  I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true. Hard work pays off. If you want
[00:11:17 -> 00:11:21]  to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don't love something,
[00:11:21 -> 00:11:29]  then don't do it. Another example of someone who achieved greatness telling us that basically it's
[00:11:29 -> 00:11:34]  hard work and practice, and you better be motivated. What about the rest of us? Now,
[00:11:34 -> 00:11:42]  we may not all want to be gold medalists. A lot of the literature studying deliberate practice
[00:11:42 -> 00:11:47]  studies these people like Yo-Yo Ma or Albert Einstein. We don't necessarily want to be all
[00:11:47 -> 00:11:54]  gold medalists. We might want to be something else. Sports, as I said, clearly favor specific
[00:11:54 -> 00:12:00]  physical traits, but maybe we want to be nurses, engineers, work at the post office, design websites,
[00:12:00 -> 00:12:05]  or be a lawyer. This is where some of these traits don't really matter. This is what actually regular
[00:12:05 -> 00:12:10]  people want to do. We actually might want to be pretty good at several things. Maybe we want to
[00:12:10 -> 00:12:18]  be a good data scientist during the week, a competitive sailor on the weekends, and write
[00:12:18 -> 00:12:23]  short stories later in life, and you want to do all those fairly well. You want to be pretty good at
[00:12:23 -> 00:12:30]  those. Maybe, conversely, you want to play bluegrass music, and on the weekends be a database
[00:12:30 -> 00:12:36]  administrator during the week, and on the weekends when you're not playing bluegrass, you want to be
[00:12:36 -> 00:12:43]  a volunteer. What we can do is we can look at the science that was done that studies these experts,
[00:12:43 -> 00:12:49]  these really amazing people that have achieved greatness, and apply what they learned, what the
[00:12:49 -> 00:12:55]  scientists learned about watching their behavior, and apply it to ourselves. Okay, so here's what
[00:12:55 -> 00:13:01]  you need to do. This is your step-by-step guide to success. If you follow these steps for whatever it
[00:13:01 -> 00:13:06]  is you want to do, you will get to be very good. So let's go through these very slowly and carefully
[00:13:06 -> 00:13:15]  so that we understand them. So step one, find something that you are very motivated to do. Do
[00:13:15 -> 00:13:20]  not go past this step until you do. If you're not motivated, the rest of these steps are going to be
[00:13:20 -> 00:13:26]  too hard. So if you're not motivated, figure out why you're not motivated. Get motivated. Step two,
[00:13:26 -> 00:13:33]  practice, obviously, but while you're practicing you have to do something else. You have to observe
[00:13:33 -> 00:13:40]  what you're doing and watch what's working and watch what is not working. Pay attention to that.
[00:13:40 -> 00:13:48]  Note it in your mind. Okay, three, step three, be proud of the things that are working, but put them
[00:13:48 -> 00:13:57]  behind you. You're going to forget about the things that are working. Get a coach, someone else, to help
[00:13:57 -> 00:14:02]  you with what is not working. You really need to have a coach. You need some independent person
[00:14:02 -> 00:14:09]  that is watching you, and later this could be you if you get to be very good at this, but early on I
[00:14:10 -> 00:14:17]  wouldn't recommend it. Just go find an independent person that can help you to watch you to help you
[00:14:17 -> 00:14:24]  figure out what is not working. What you're after here is trying to identify the weak link in the
[00:14:24 -> 00:14:29]  chain. This is what you're trying to find. You need to identify it. You need to have a coach
[00:14:29 -> 00:14:38]  identify it, and you need to focus on that weak link. Now, once you've done that, step five is
[00:14:38 -> 00:14:44]  design metrics. When I mean things you can measure, design metrics that you can use to measure your
[00:14:44 -> 00:14:50]  progress in a systematic manner. In other words, you'll not be able to progress as quickly and get
[00:14:50 -> 00:14:57]  as good if your judgment of whether you're getting better is, yeah, I think I'm getting better. That's
[00:14:57 -> 00:15:03]  just not good enough. What you need is something usually that's attached to a number. For example,
[00:15:03 -> 00:15:07]  suppose you want to learn to type better. You can watch the frequency of your mistakes. That's a
[00:15:07 -> 00:15:12]  number you can watch, and you can see how it changes day by day and week by week, or the number
[00:15:12 -> 00:15:16]  of words per minute that you're typing. That's something you can watch every day, watch every
[00:15:16 -> 00:15:22]  week, see if it's changing. Basketball, what percentage of free throws are you missing on
[00:15:22 -> 00:15:27]  Monday? What percentage of free throws did you miss on Tuesday? Write those numbers down. Watch
[00:15:27 -> 00:15:32]  to see how they're changing. You need to have something that you and your coach can actually
[00:15:32 -> 00:15:39]  watch to see if there's progress or not, and if not, figure out why not. Okay, step six, and this
[00:15:39 -> 00:15:46]  is the very crucial one, is that you want to practice, but you only want to practice those
[00:15:46 -> 00:15:53]  things that will bring improvements. In other words, if you have a nice link up here, it's nice
[00:15:53 -> 00:15:59]  and strong, you have a nice link up here, you have a link here, do not practice those. If you are
[00:16:00 -> 00:16:06]  learning to play guitar, and you can play Stairway to Heaven really well, stop doing it. You need to
[00:16:06 -> 00:16:11]  focus on those things that bring improvements. As I said earlier with my example of typing, I type
[00:16:11 -> 00:16:18]  every single day, year after year, I do not get better because I'm not trying to bring improvements.
[00:16:18 -> 00:16:26]  Now, keep in mind that the task that you then are left with will be very hard by definition. If it
[00:16:26 -> 00:16:32]  were easy, it would be something that if you practice it, it would bring no benefit to you. So,
[00:16:32 -> 00:16:37]  it's not going to be fun. Keep that in mind. It will be hard. These are by definition are the
[00:16:37 -> 00:16:44]  things you're not good at yet. So, for example, going back to the example of typing, maybe what
[00:16:44 -> 00:16:49]  you want to do is practice these keys. Maybe that's where your weakness is. Focus on those.
[00:16:49 -> 00:16:55]  I'm just using this as an example, but focus on the things that are rare, that are hard for you,
[00:16:55 -> 00:17:00]  things that are your bottleneck. Figure out what those are. If you're learning guitar, like I said,
[00:17:00 -> 00:17:06]  don't play Stairway to Heaven over and over again. Go find the very difficult guitar chords,
[00:17:06 -> 00:17:10]  focus on those, have your coach watch you, and see if you're getting better.
[00:17:11 -> 00:17:18]  Okay, final step, be inventive. Now, what does that mean? What I mean by that is when the
[00:17:18 -> 00:17:24]  scientists observe people that became very, very good at something, what they would do is they
[00:17:24 -> 00:17:31]  would invent ways of practicing. They were very, very specific to them. And remember, all of this
[00:17:31 -> 00:17:36]  is about you. It's not about someone else. You need to figure out what works for you. For example,
[00:17:36 -> 00:17:43]  if you are a football player and you want to be able to outrun somebody and you feel like you're
[00:17:43 -> 00:17:53]  weak on that, maybe you should go run upstairs as fast as you can for an hour every other day,
[00:17:53 -> 00:17:59]  and that is specific to you. That's your goal, that's your weakness, and that is what you need
[00:17:59 -> 00:18:07]  to invent, something like that that will get you through. As I said earlier, maybe you're playing,
[00:18:07 -> 00:18:13]  you want to figure out how to type better, be inventive. What is your weakness? Focus on the
[00:18:13 -> 00:18:21]  things that are specific to you, like maybe you work as an accountant, and there are certain
[00:18:21 -> 00:18:28]  symbols that keep coming up all the time that you need to focus on. Do that. Maybe you're weak
[00:18:28 -> 00:18:34]  with your pinkies. Maybe you should focus on typing using only the letters of your pinkies.
[00:18:34 -> 00:18:40]  Whatever it is that focuses on you, invent those things, invent those strategies, invent those ways
[00:18:40 -> 00:18:45]  of practicing that are specific to you. It doesn't matter what works for anybody else. It matters
[00:18:45 -> 00:18:51]  what works for you. And then finally, repeat. Go back up, practice some more,
[00:18:52 -> 00:18:57]  observe what's working and not working again. It will now be different, and then you proceed
[00:18:57 -> 00:19:04]  through these steps again, figure out what you need to do, and repeat. And with that, you will
[00:19:04 -> 00:19:10]  slowly work out all of the things that you're really bad at. You'll spend all of your time
[00:19:10 -> 00:19:16]  focusing on the things that you really need to improve with and get to be really good.
[00:19:16 -> 00:19:25]  Okay. So one last reminder. If you're enjoying practicing, you're doing something wrong.
[00:19:25 -> 00:19:31]  As I said, these tasks will be hard. So basically, if you want to get good at something,
[00:19:31 -> 00:19:38]  you have to be willing to go through unpleasant practice. It's how you practice. It's not how
[00:19:38 -> 00:19:47]  much you practice. Okay. Another quote from somebody who became the United States Secretary
[00:19:47 -> 00:19:52]  of State, Colin Powell. What does he have to say about this? A dream doesn't become a reality
[00:19:52 -> 00:19:58]  through magic. It happens through sweat, determination, and hard work. As you can see,
[00:19:58 -> 00:20:03]  there's a pattern here. These people that have achieved greatness, all of them felt like they
[00:20:03 -> 00:20:11]  didn't get there in some easy way. Another thing that's worth keeping in mind is it's worth
[00:20:11 -> 00:20:17]  getting good at getting good. If you follow those steps, it may be hard for you to follow those
[00:20:17 -> 00:20:22]  steps. It may be that you're not used to following those steps. It may be you're not used to paying
[00:20:22 -> 00:20:27]  attention to what's not working. Practice it with everything you do. And then when you're ready to
[00:20:27 -> 00:20:31]  do something you really want to get good at, you'll be ready and you'll know how to carry out
[00:20:31 -> 00:20:38]  those steps. So think about getting good at getting good. Another quote from a football player,
[00:20:38 -> 00:20:43]  Roger Staalbach, talks about confidence. How do you get confidence? It's the result of hours and
[00:20:43 -> 00:20:51]  days and weeks and years of constant work and dedication. These quarterbacks don't get where
[00:20:51 -> 00:20:59]  they got because of some innate talent. They worked really hard. Okay. So let's just run through those
[00:20:59 -> 00:21:06]  steps one more time with some quotes just to make sure that you understand them. All right. First,
[00:21:06 -> 00:21:11]  be motivated and be disciplined. If you don't have that, you're not going to be able to put in the
[00:21:11 -> 00:21:17]  time that it takes. Here's a quote from Louis Pasteur on that. Let me tell you the secret
[00:21:17 -> 00:21:24]  that has led me to my goals. My strength lies solely in my tenacity. You gotta have tenacity
[00:21:24 -> 00:21:31]  to make this work. Okay. Second step, practice and observe what is not working. It's a quote from
[00:21:31 -> 00:21:38]  the great psychologist Maslow. What is necessary to change a person is to change his awareness of
[00:21:38 -> 00:21:45]  himself. You really have to look at yourself objectively and become aware of what you're doing.
[00:21:45 -> 00:21:49]  And I want to pause right now to talk about something called the Dunning-Kruger effect
[00:21:49 -> 00:21:56]  because it's really important here. And what it says is that people are actually not very good
[00:21:56 -> 00:22:01]  at seeing how good they are. And so here's an example from the Dunning-Kruger effect
[00:22:02 -> 00:22:09]  where you measure someone's performance. And this line right here is their measured performance.
[00:22:10 -> 00:22:17]  And then you ask them to judge that performance. How well do you think that they did? And that
[00:22:17 -> 00:22:21]  actually corresponds to this line up here. So this is the actual performance.
[00:22:23 -> 00:22:28]  And this is what they think is their performance. And what you see is most people
[00:22:29 -> 00:22:37]  overestimate their performance by up to 50 percent. So keep that in mind that this applies
[00:22:37 -> 00:22:45]  to all of us. And this is why we need external feedback coaches. And this is why we need metrics
[00:22:45 -> 00:22:53]  because science shows that we tend to fool ourselves in exactly what our performance level
[00:22:53 -> 00:22:59]  is. So keep in mind that for all of us, the Dunning-Kruger effect, which is based on scientific
[00:22:59 -> 00:23:04]  research, tells us we're not very good. That's why you need metrics. That's why you need a coach.
[00:23:05 -> 00:23:13]  Okay. Obtain measurable feedback. That's part of the metrics. What does Ken have to say about this?
[00:23:13 -> 00:23:21]  Feedback is the breakfast of champions. Okay. Identify your weakest performance areas. It's
[00:23:21 -> 00:23:27]  really important to focus on the weakest areas. What does Elon Musk, the famous entrepreneur,
[00:23:27 -> 00:23:32]  have to say about this? I think it's very important to have a feedback loop where you're
[00:23:32 -> 00:23:37]  constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better. I think that's
[00:23:37 -> 00:23:44]  the single best piece of advice. Constantly think about how you could be doing things better and
[00:23:44 -> 00:23:55]  questioning yourself. That's from Elon Musk. Okay. Now be inventive. Last step. Here's some
[00:23:55 -> 00:24:01]  advice from Robert Frost. Two roads diverge in a wood and I took the one less traveled by
[00:24:01 -> 00:24:06]  and it has made all of the difference. I chose this quote because it represents this idea of
[00:24:06 -> 00:24:13]  being inventive. I took the one less traveled by. That is to say you need to pick the one that
[00:24:13 -> 00:24:19]  works for you. Just because some way of practicing works for someone else doesn't mean it's going to
[00:24:19 -> 00:24:24]  work for you. Someone practices a certain number of hours. You may have to practice more. You may
[00:24:24 -> 00:24:32]  have to practice less. Take the road less traveled. Okay. So with that, go forth and practice and
[00:24:32 -> 00:24:39]  practice so that it hurts and you will become very good. So what's it going to be for you?
[00:24:39 -> 00:24:46]  100 hours? 1,000 hours? 10,000 hours? All right. Thank you for being here at New Planet School.
[00:24:46 -> 00:24:49]  See you back here soon, I hope.
