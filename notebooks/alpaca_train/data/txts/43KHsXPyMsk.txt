[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  This video is going to show you how to take seven very simple techniques to add incredible
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:10]  depth to your projects. Hi, I'm Ingrid Blackburn and my goal for you today is that you learn
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:15]  something, you get inspired, and that you create. So let's dive right in. We're going to start off
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:23]  with a six by six art canvas board. This is just a regular canvas panel and I'm covering it in
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:28]  gesso using just a little card to spread that. I'm going to make sure that that's fully dry before
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:32]  moving on. That's going to act as a primer in between. We're adding some liquid and obviously
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:38]  some ink refills and spritzing some water down. This is going to help to create that barrier in
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:44]  between this wet layer. So you can see just randomly spreading around five different colors
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:48]  actually of ink refills. I'm starting with the lightest shade and working my way up. All the
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:55]  supplies are listed below in the description below this video and you want to make sure that that is
[00:00:55 -> 00:01:02]  thoroughly dry before moving on. I'm just going to add some more depth by starting to work with
[00:01:02 -> 00:01:08]  some deeper colors and a little bit of transition. Just kind of having a little bit of light and dark
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:14]  in this project and that really helps give the background a little bit more interest. So once
[00:01:14 -> 00:01:20]  you have it exactly as you want it, and doesn't that look great? The depth is awesome and I love
[00:01:20 -> 00:01:23]  that I can create that with reinkers. We're going to take some modeling paste and this is by the
[00:01:23 -> 00:01:31]  Crafters Workshop and this has the consistency of, you know, kind of like cake icing. It's a very
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:37]  pliable medium. I'm going to use some Skylight reinker, which is one of the darker colors that I have.
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:45]  I'm using reinkers by Catherine Pooler and I love these blues. They have such pretty shades. I'm using
[00:01:45 -> 00:01:50]  one from the party line and the rest are from the spa line. I really love the soft muted colors that
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:56]  she has in her ink line. So I'm going to go ahead and spread those through this stencil by the
[00:01:56 -> 00:02:04]  Crafters Workshop and this is just going to give me a subtle little background interesting
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:08]  look. I'm not putting it everywhere, just kind of bits and pieces. I'm going to make sure that that's
[00:02:08 -> 00:02:14]  completely dry, but it really kind of blends into our background and you can see where it's on the
[00:02:14 -> 00:02:19]  angle here as I'm drying it, that it really adds some dimension to it as well. Next up we're going
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:24]  to take some Distress Oxides and I'm going to start off with Vintage Photo. Vintage Photo is,
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:30]  you know, a real good shade when you're wanting to do some antiquing to, you know, give it that
[00:02:30 -> 00:02:35]  kind of a feel, a warm feel to your project. I am going to skip ahead here. We're going to use three
[00:02:35 -> 00:02:42]  shades. We're going to use Walnut as well as Soot Black just on the edges, but it's important to go
[00:02:42 -> 00:02:48]  with a little bit more depth in color, you know, using multiple shades because that gives you that
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:52]  real interesting look. I'm also dragging it into the project a little bit with my sponge tool.
[00:02:52 -> 00:02:57]  For a more in-depth tutorial, something that's a little more real time where you can truly follow
[00:02:57 -> 00:03:02]  along and get a lot more insight into the mediums and techniques that I'm using, be sure to check
[00:03:02 -> 00:03:08]  out my Patreon channel. That link is also in the description below. So once we've heat set that
[00:03:08 -> 00:03:14]  Distress Oxide ink, we're going to move on to the next step. I have some leftover ghost prints
[00:03:14 -> 00:03:19]  from a monoprinting session, and these are great. I love to save these even though they don't look
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:24]  like much because they are awesome for edging and backgrounds, and that's what we're going to use
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:30]  them for. So this is deli paper, and you can see it fits just the width of my piece and goes a little
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:36]  bit more. I'm going to remove some of that excess white space, that negative space that you don't
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:41]  need because it doesn't really serve any purpose. It's just extra noise on our project. We're going
[00:03:41 -> 00:03:46]  to use some Glazing Medium by Liquid Text, and we're going to brush this on with a paintbrush,
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:54]  and this is going to seal our layers before going to the collaging step. I don't really want any of
[00:03:54 -> 00:04:02]  those ink refills to move. Those are really, really water reactive, as well as the distress,
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:07]  even though we've heat set it because it's sitting on top of those ink refills, and we have to kind
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:11]  of remember that and just be cognizant of it. So it's good to just seal everything with the
[00:04:11 -> 00:04:17]  Glazing Medium. Now a better way to do this probably would have been to use a gel plate and
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:22]  put that Glazing Medium down and just press that in because you can see I kind of went a couple
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:29]  too many times with my brush and removed some of that distress oxide and ink refill. So what I'm
[00:04:29 -> 00:04:33]  going to do is just kind of add a little bit more, and it's okay even to have that little bit of
[00:04:33 -> 00:04:40]  white there. It adds that extra little bit of light space. So it actually worked in my project,
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:46]  but you can also use the method of using a gel plate. Next up, Matte Medium. You can see I have
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:50]  a couple different Matte Mediums. One was by The Crafter's Workshop, one by Liquid Text.
[00:04:51 -> 00:04:56]  Love this to do some collaging. This is great. You want to make sure to thoroughly coat your space
[00:04:56 -> 00:05:03]  where your deli paper is going to rest on because we need to actually have that medium
[00:05:03 -> 00:05:08]  basically come through. So from the bottom and the top you can see I'm being very generous with
[00:05:08 -> 00:05:13]  this, and I'm going to actually end up wrapping it around my canvas so that it actually gets
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:18]  adhered all the way through to the back. I'm going to use my fingers. This is a messy project.
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:23]  If you don't like to get your fingers dirty, you know, that's fine. Some people don't. Go ahead and
[00:05:23 -> 00:05:27]  use some gloves, but definitely you want to rub that medium. You want to make sure that none of
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:33]  that white space is still showing. See how that just becomes part of the canvas? Really important
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:38]  there. Now you're going to end up peeling kind of the top back and just work that medium over the
[00:05:38 -> 00:05:45]  edges so that it's very seamless. This is Tacky Wind Dry Gel Medium, and this is a fabulous
[00:05:45 -> 00:05:50]  medium to do a little bit of foiling without needing to heat set it. So this is by The
[00:05:50 -> 00:05:56]  Crafter's Workshop. Just using a palette knife to spread this through the stencil, and this is the
[00:05:56 -> 00:06:02]  Two Hearts stencil by The Crafter's Workshop. Just going to use bits and pieces of it. You know, a lot
[00:06:02 -> 00:06:08]  of times with stencils I don't use the entire stencil. Sometimes, you know, partial stenciling
[00:06:08 -> 00:06:14]  actually is better than using the entire image. You know, I just wanted a little bit of added
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:18]  interest in certain spots on my project. So what we're doing was we're spreading this medium through
[00:06:18 -> 00:06:23]  and being pretty liberal here, and just going to kind of put it through, and then we're going to go
[00:06:23 -> 00:06:28]  ahead and heat set that. So you can see we have a lot of depth and interest there. I love those
[00:06:28 -> 00:06:33]  pieces, and if you don't have deli paper or any leftover monoprints, you can certainly take tissue
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:40]  paper and a micron pen and create a pattern or stamp on something and get the same result. So
[00:06:40 -> 00:06:47]  we're adding that foil, and I'm using the reverse side of the foil connected to the tacky part. So
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:51]  you want the shiny part, the part that you're going to see up top like that. You're going to
[00:06:51 -> 00:06:58]  burnish it with your fingers and very slowly peel that back. This is a great way of adding foil to
[00:06:58 -> 00:07:04]  your project with, like I said, without needing any sort of a heating element, and it's great for
[00:07:04 -> 00:07:10]  mixed media projects. I really love how this turned out. The contrast is really nice, and I love adding
[00:07:10 -> 00:07:16]  foiled accents to pieces. So now that we've created an interesting background, I still want to add
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:24]  some little tiny accents. To get started, we're going to use Gelato here, and just kind of wiping
[00:07:24 -> 00:07:29]  it onto the stencil and then using my finger to work that medium through the actual positive
[00:07:29 -> 00:07:35]  space of the stencil, and just adding some little tiny details to some areas where I felt
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:41]  it needed a little bit more and was kind of lacking. We're going to use this medium to then
[00:07:42 -> 00:07:49]  act kind of as an adhesive for some embossing powder. I'm going to take some WOW! Primary Bark
[00:07:49 -> 00:07:56]  Embossing Powder and just kind of put that over some of those detailed areas, and then we're going
[00:07:56 -> 00:08:03]  to heat set that with a heat tool. I love adding embossing. Embossing powder really is a great
[00:08:03 -> 00:08:07]  accent to a lot of your projects, not just for cards but mixed media projects, really anything
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:13]  that you do. I encourage you to try some different colors or different textured ones. There's some
[00:08:13 -> 00:08:19]  great depth that you can get with some interesting embossing powders nowadays. So I took another
[00:08:19 -> 00:08:27]  leftover monoprint that you see there and cut out some dragonflies. I also cut out the die cut
[00:08:27 -> 00:08:34]  art happens from a couple of sheets of paper. I embossed the top layer of my dragonflies as well as
[00:08:35 -> 00:08:41]  the word die. I'm just going to use a little bit of matte medium to adhere these together,
[00:08:41 -> 00:08:48]  and these are going to act as die cuts which will provide a little bit of interest to the top of my
[00:08:48 -> 00:08:54]  actual canvas. But before I actually put everything down, I added those two together for a little bit
[00:08:54 -> 00:09:01]  of height. I thought that was kind of a nice accent to the piece. I'm going to take a pit pen, and a
[00:09:01 -> 00:09:09]  pit pen is probably one of a mixed media artist's number one tools, I think. There's so much great
[00:09:09 -> 00:09:15]  depth you can add, and just that little tiny something to a project with a pit pen. It stays
[00:09:15 -> 00:09:21]  wet for about 30 seconds, and you can use your finger to rub it back and forth and just create
[00:09:21 -> 00:09:26]  a little bit of grunge effect. You can see me doing it on the actual canvas itself. They come in all
[00:09:26 -> 00:09:30]  different colors, white, black, and white and black should definitely be in your stash.
[00:09:31 -> 00:09:38]  Then to adhere my die cut pieces down, again using that multi matte medium, just kind of putting
[00:09:38 -> 00:09:44]  that down. I want to add that liberally because we have height, we have all different types of
[00:09:44 -> 00:09:50]  textures and materials and mediums that we've used, so be very liberal with that. It dries crystal
[00:09:50 -> 00:09:56]  clear. I'm using one by Liquitex. It comes from all different companies, but you definitely want
[00:09:56 -> 00:10:01]  one that's going to dry crystal clear. They usually come in a gloss format, but I like the matte
[00:10:01 -> 00:10:09]  version. Because this has a lot of fine pieces, I added some medium to the back in those corners
[00:10:09 -> 00:10:14]  just to make sure that those had plenty of adhesive to it. I'm going to add something
[00:10:14 -> 00:10:18]  heavy on top. I'm actually going to use a couple of acrylic blocks to make sure that it adheres
[00:10:18 -> 00:10:23]  really well to the canvas before placing all those dragonflies down. Now I thought it would
[00:10:23 -> 00:10:29]  be kind of interesting to have one look like it's kind of in motion or coming onto the piece,
[00:10:29 -> 00:10:36]  so I wrap that around and adhere that that way. Isn't all that detail amazing? I love when you put
[00:10:36 -> 00:10:41]  all these little tiny things together. It creates something very artistic. If you want to learn more,
