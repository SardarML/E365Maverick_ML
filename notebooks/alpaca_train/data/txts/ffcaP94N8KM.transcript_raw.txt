 Composers often include signs that control the volume at which the player executes a  certain part of the music or the whole piece.  These volume indications are called dynamics.  Traditionally, we use Italian words handed down to us from centuries of classical composers  based in Italy to show how loudly or softly to play a passage.  The most basic dynamic indications include piano meaning soft.  Yes, this is the same word as the instrument, and part of the reason the piano got its name  was that it could play loudly and softly, something most earlier keyboard instruments  couldn't do.  Now dynamic indications are shown in most scores with an italicized bold P.  Forte means loud or strong.  It comes from the same Latin root as the English word for force or forceful.  It will be shown in scores with an italicized bold F.  For in-between dynamics, we can add an M for mezzo or middle before the F or P to indicate  mezzo forte or mezzo piano.  And you can even make a piano or forte more extreme by piling on the P's and F's.  So two P's like this will indicate pianissimo or whispery soft.  And if you want something very, very loud, you can write fortissimo or two F's.
