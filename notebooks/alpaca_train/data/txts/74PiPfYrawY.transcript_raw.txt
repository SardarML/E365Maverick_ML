 hey what's going on y'all hope everyone's having a fabulous day if you haven't gotten  a chance to subscribe to this channel please do so i want you to ring that notification  bell that way when i drop a video you guys will be notified this video is going to be  a little bit special to me because my team and i what we did was we went and we scoured  the internet to find as much research as we possibly could on what is it going to take  for you guys to know what credit score is required for certain credit cards when you  guys are building credit and you have the foundation you went out and got your two secure  credit cards you got your my jewelers your new coast direct and your self account you  want to know what is it going to take for you to get to the next level i made videos  talking about don't be a credit hoe and in those videos what i was saying was i don't  want you guys to incur a bunch of inquiries on your credit report and so i felt like it  was my responsibility to help you guys reduce the inquiries on your credit report so what  we did was we put together a lender's list and that way you guys kind of know what credit  you can apply for and get approvals for now i'm not saying that if you use this list it's  going to guarantee that you're going to get qualified for these credit cards but what  i wanted to do was at least put something together for you guys to help reduce your  inquiries because what you're doing is you you guys get to like a 650 range and you guys  start applying for chase american express and you're getting denied and these inquiries  are being put on your credit report and sometimes it doesn't have to be that way but if you  don't know what it takes to qualify for those cards then of course you're going to just  you're applying blindly and so what i wanted to do like i said as i wanted to put something  together for you guys so that when you guys apply for credit cards you have a better chance  of getting qualified and that's that's something that's near and dear to my heart because like  i said i made a lot of videos about being a credit hoe so let's just dive into the computer  i just want to show you this pdf that we put together for you guys and i'm telling you  guys up front there's no charge for it just go in the description of this video pick up  the pdf and you guys will be able to see exactly what it's going to take to qualify for certain  credit cards but let's just go into the video or to the pdf and see exactly what it is that  we put together for you guys all right so i hope you enjoy this so if you if you guys  like it i don't very i don't ask for very many thumbs up but just give me a thumbs up  if you guys like this video what i did was i put together like i said um the ultimate  guide to building credit because you need to know what is it going to take to qualify  for certain loans for certain loans credit cards stuff like that and that's what i've  been trying to tell you guys that i'm trying to put together for you guys and as you can  see if you go through uh there's a little table of contents here where you guys kind  of see what page and as you can see there's quite a few pages to this so it's not little  something that i put together it took a lot of work so if you guys appreciate it well  i should say i hope you guys appreciate it so uh you have your pre-qualifications you  have your secure credit cards on page 11 uh personal and and yes i do have some business  credit stuff on page 15 um some of you that are looking for automobile financing um i  put some lenders in here that do auto financing and i know i'm gonna get a couple of yahoos  out here that's gonna say well what about this company or this company listen i we're  trying to put together this isn't finished we're gonna keep adding uh more companies  to this as we go but at least you have something to reference a base a good base right and  you know we we did put some disclaimers in here um this is for educational purposes only  and we cannot guarantee any results or approvals for from our techniques like i said just because  you're you may be at a 660 range in the the pdf says that you're going to be at a 660  if you were at a 660 you're going to get qualified doesn't necessarily mean you're  going to get qualified okay so it just means that you've got a better chance of getting  qualified if you're at if it says 660 and you're at a 620 i wouldn't apply for it as  of yet okay so i just want you know to make sure that i'm clear on that and that's what  this is about we had a little bit of jargon that we wanted to get through um pre-qualified  offers capital one business cards require a personal guarantor uh there's a lot of people  out here that talk about getting business credit without a personal guarantor i'm gonna  talk about that in the future but you know right now we'll the all these cards are going  to require a personal guarantee okay so uh bank of america these are all pre-qualifications  right if you want to pre-qualify for these um certain cards um you have that but you  know of course you have the prosper loans lending club um they do not offer any wells  fargo and you guys will see wells fargo don't offer any uh personal secure credit cards  anymore and of course this is my favorite section because you guys know how i feel about  building credit with secure credit cards don't let them tell you that you can't all  right and first of all open sky here's and all these links are clickable so you guys  can just go to these links click on the links and go directly to the website so a refundable  deposit 200 to 3000 annual fee is 35 dollars first progress uh no credit history and minimum  credit score also what you're going to find in this pamphlet this pdf is the fact that  um it's going to also show where where it's going to pull from so this one says reports  to experience equifax and transunion um to discover it uh two percent one of the only  secure credit cards that offer a cash back right and i absolutely love the discover it  secure credit card so if you guys ever get a chance to um to to get to this secure credit  card this is one of the best secure credit cards that you that you can get it graduates  in about a year right and as you see it's a hard inquiry on your credit report should have  a 640 all right so if you're not at a 640 credit score i would not apply for the discover it secure  credit card all right and that's the great thing about this pamphlet when do i apply for secure  credit cards yes you can get approved before a 640 but more than likely wait until you get to  the 640 range before you even apply for the discovery it secure credit card okay um the  capital one secure credit card no annual fee refundable deposit 99 to 200 dollars minimum  right and capital one secure credit card um kind of does a little bit different instead of giving  you your money back for the graduation of the capital one secure credit card what they do is  they just increase your limit they call that the graduation period usaa secure platinum  secured american express um but let's just go through and and see a little bit of of what else  we have here and like i said these are the unsecured credit cards now that we're getting into  um this capital one quick silver it pulls from your experience requirement 580 credit score  so it doesn't it's one of your lower entry cards the capital one quick silver and it's great to be  a part of capital one in itself because they have so many different products they have auto loans  they have so many different things that you can do once you become a part of the capital one family  and so that's what i like about capital one a lot of you guys burned them i burned them also  and that's something that i want you guys to understand that just because you burned a credit  card company let me back up when i say burned what i mean is your account went to collections  and you didn't pay them back what you can do is apply like two three years if it's like two three  years old chances are if you apply again you could get approved i'm not going to say that they are  but i did a video where i talked about that where i once had a capital one credit card i included  them in my bankruptcy never paid them back but now i do i went and applied for capital one credit  card again and i got approved with them so not only do i have the capital one personal i also  have the capital one business so those of you that are saying well damn i burned capital one  just understand that just because you burned them previously does not mean that you cannot reapply  with them and get approved okay so that's the capital one quick silver this is the uh capital  one platinum requires a 580 credit score uh pulls from experience credit bureau and like i said you  need a 580 fico score um an excellent card for those with no credit history or a low credit score  there is no annual fee on the platinum okay if you're following my steps it's not easy to i mean  it's not hard to get to a 580 fico score a lot of you think it's hard to get to a 580 maybe you're  sitting at a 480 been at a 480 and you're like how do i get to the 580 if you go back and you  watch this youtube channel i can i showed you guys how to get to a 580 580 is not hard pretty  much that pretty much everybody that's been watching this channel for a year at least a year  should be at least a 580 it should be at least a 640 if you've been watching this channel  personal uh personal and business credit cards uh delta sky miles uh requires 660  uh fico score 5,000 for a 5,000 limit uh let me see  annual fee is zero percent there's a blue cash every day it's personal and as you can see we  just went through and we tried to put and these these are business credit cards we just tried to  compile and and put something in place so that you guys kind of have an idea of what it takes  a business platinum card if you're not at a 690 credit score wouldn't apply for this card um and  and as you will see that i put a lot of information into this business advantage bank of america  needs to be at a 720 fico score right uh pulls from transunion credit bureau  must have a 650 which additional info client data  okay proof for 9,000 business line 722 fico six inquiries and that's that's something that i've  been trying to say that you guys can't have too many inquiries and if you can try and keep your  inquiries at least five and below if you're starting to get over five inquiries on your  credit report either start disputing them or what you want to do is just give it some time because  inquiries only stay on your credit report for uh 24 months so if you have inquiries that are over  24 months you definitely want to dispute those inquiries but they should all your inquiries  should fall off after 24 months so like i said i put a lot of information into this if you guys  want this pdf uh then just go in and chase bank pulls from experience credit bureau scores very  differently um requirement 650 or excuse me 750 credit score on a 10,000 limit chase amazon  requires a 750 credit score on a seven thousand dollar limit and like i said we just put as much  information um that we could we we can um i actually have i think it's this card that i  have with chase the chase the ink bold um requires a 720 credit score on a 15,000 limit and that's  about right that's about right because that's what that's exactly where my limit is on this  chasing card and like i said i don't want to go through all of these but it's it's a long list of  stuff like i said there's like close to 50 pages in this pamphlet that my team put together and i  hope you guys enjoy it because it took us a little bit of time took us a little bit of money to to  get this together and all you have to do if you want this pdf go in the description click the
