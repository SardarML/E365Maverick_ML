[00:00:00 -> 00:00:04]  Hello friend my name is Azam Assood today we will discuss about agreements and contracts
[00:00:04 -> 00:00:09]  friend let me tell you that it's a very interesting topic and I'm very hopeful
[00:00:09 -> 00:00:16]  that you will definitely like the topic so let us start our tutorial first of
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:20]  all I would request to subscribe to my channel and also click on the bell
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:26]  option so let's start what is basically agreement and contract I hope that you
[00:00:26 -> 00:00:31]  have definitely heard about these two terms very frequently in meetings in
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:38]  discussions and with client so what is basically agreement friend agreement is
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:42]  basically an understanding which basically reached between two or more
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:46]  parties this is called an agreement remember one thing that it is not
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:53]  necessary that agreement should be in a written form form basically agreement
[00:00:53 -> 00:00:59]  means that it is an understanding between two parties and as it is not in
[00:00:59 -> 00:01:05]  the written format it the agreement cannot be challenged or cannot be put
[00:01:05 -> 00:01:11]  into a court of law so what is agreement agreement is basically understanding
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:19]  between two or more parties now contract contract is basically a specific type of
[00:01:19 -> 00:01:25]  agreement this is also an agreement that by its terms and elements is legal
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:32]  binding and in enforceable in a court of law that means basically it has some
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:37]  terms and conditions and it has some legal binding legal binding means that
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:45]  if someone breach the terms and conditions then we can case a file in
[00:01:45 -> 00:01:51]  the court of law so this is basically a main difference between a contract and
[00:01:51 -> 00:01:58]  an agreement agreement is just understanding or mutual consensus
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:03]  between two or more parties which cannot be challenged and which cannot be put
[00:02:03 -> 00:02:09]  into court of law agreement contract is basically is also a type of agreement
[00:02:09 -> 00:02:16]  but it has some terms and elements which has some legal formats which can
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:24]  be which can be put into a court of law if there is any breach of terms so this
[00:02:24 -> 00:02:30]  is basically a main difference between agreement and contract okay now what are
[00:02:30 -> 00:02:36]  the basically requirement for agreement and contract friend remember one thing
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:43]  that agreement means that there is some agreement there is some consensus between
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:49]  two or more parties basically parties need only come to a common understanding
[00:02:49 -> 00:02:54]  as to their relative rights and responsibilities and the requirement for
[00:02:54 -> 00:02:58]  the formation of a contract are more precise and comparatively stricter
[00:02:58 -> 00:03:04]  stricter mean for that what does that mean basically see whenever we do a
[00:03:04 -> 00:03:13]  agreement the terms and conditions are very simple and it is not necessary that
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:19]  they are very formal normally agreement is that agreement means informal things
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:25]  and but when we talk about the contract it has some mutual consensus and the
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:31]  things are more stricter more strict as compared to the agreement why because
[00:03:32 -> 00:03:38]  the court of law the you always know that if any party breach the law or
[00:03:38 -> 00:03:44]  breach the terms and condition it can be challenged it can be put into a into the
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:51]  court of law now essential for contract what are the common things which are
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:57]  very necessary for a contract whenever we do a contract between two or more
[00:03:57 -> 00:04:00]  parties what are the essential what are the things which are necessary for
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:06]  contract first of all offer and acceptance offer and acceptance means
[00:04:06 -> 00:04:12]  that every contract must include a specific offer something to provide and
[00:04:12 -> 00:04:17]  the acceptance of that offer okay what does that mean for example if you are
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:22]  doing a employment contract so that means that employee has to offer some
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:30]  services and company will offer him some sort of salary some benefits any bonus
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:37]  some sort of like that so offer and acceptance mutual consent of mutual
[00:04:37 -> 00:04:41]  consent mean the offer and acceptance must be freely consented by the parties
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:46]  all parties must agree to the same terms and all must intend for a binding
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:53]  agreement to be formed mutual consent means that both parties coming to the
[00:04:53 -> 00:04:58]  same example employment contract like employees offering some services and
[00:04:58 -> 00:05:04]  companies offering a salary so here comes the mutual consensus like both
[00:05:04 -> 00:05:08]  parties are free both parties companies also free and employees also free so
[00:05:08 -> 00:05:15]  both parties with a mutual consensus the agreement they contract the they sign
[00:05:15 -> 00:05:21]  the contract so both parties sign the contract with a mutual consensus the
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:27]  point of view the consensus is basically included from both parties from contract
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:33]  from company and from employee as well consideration this is something of value
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:36]  that is exchanged between the two parties consideration can take the form
[00:05:36 -> 00:05:41]  of money goods or services but both parties must provide something of value
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:46]  for a contract to be formed if only one side provide something it is a gift not
[00:05:46 -> 00:05:51]  a contract same thing like for example it is necessary that both parties
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:56]  contribute if only one party is contributing that means it is a gift so
[00:05:57 -> 00:06:03]  basically contract is it is necessary that both parties provide some sort of
[00:06:03 -> 00:06:09]  some sort any something like for example money goods services so when both
[00:06:09 -> 00:06:16]  parties are contributing so so basically this is called a contract if one
[00:06:16 -> 00:06:22]  party is only contributing this is a gift not a contract now competence
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:27]  means both parties must comprehend the situation and understand what the
[00:06:27 -> 00:06:32]  contract will entail thus no party can in a way that would prevent them from
[00:06:32 -> 00:06:37]  understanding the terms of contract that means that the both parties should be
[00:06:37 -> 00:06:42]  competent competent means that they know the scope of contract the terms and
[00:06:42 -> 00:06:49]  conditions the agreements the mutual consensus so they knows the services the
[00:06:49 -> 00:06:56]  scope and what would happen if they do they don't fulfill the requirements so
[00:06:56 -> 00:07:01]  they both both parties both two or more parties should be competent enough to
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:07]  understand the requirement of contract and they should understand that what
[00:07:07 -> 00:07:13]  they have to deliver and they also should know the consequences if they
[00:07:13 -> 00:07:22]  don't deliver the required services or things now legal purpose the purpose of
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:26]  the contract must fall within the confines of lawful conduct in other words
[00:07:26 -> 00:07:31]  a court would never enforce a contract regarding something illegal that means
[00:07:31 -> 00:07:35]  that the whatever the contract is basically going to sign remember one
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:40]  thing that all things should become under the legal boundaries remember one
[00:07:40 -> 00:07:46]  thing that if if the contract is not under the legal binding remember one
[00:07:46 -> 00:07:51]  thing that you cannot go into the court because if it is not under the law of
[00:07:51 -> 00:07:56]  country so it cannot be challenged in the court of law so remember one thing
[00:07:56 -> 00:08:02]  that whatever is basically going to sign in the contract it should come under the
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:09]  laws of your country and one thing remember that if it is under the law of
[00:08:09 -> 00:08:15]  your country so you can you can challenge the contract in the in the
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:20]  court of law if there is any breach of any terms and condition but remember one
[00:08:20 -> 00:08:26]  thing if it is not under the law of a country so it is definitely cannot be
[00:08:26 -> 00:08:31]  changed there is no use to put in the contract so remember one thing there are
[00:08:31 -> 00:08:39]  the things should be legal and come under the law of your country example of
[00:08:39 -> 00:08:44]  agreement and contract agreement as we discussed that it is a very common
[00:08:44 -> 00:08:51]  example of agreement with a mutual consensus for example you rent a car for
[00:08:51 -> 00:08:56]  example tenancy agreements payment agreements very simple example of rent a
[00:08:56 -> 00:09:02]  car for example you just phone a rental company and ask them that you have to go
[00:09:02 -> 00:09:08]  somewhere they inform you that this is the rent of a car so if you buy with
[00:09:08 -> 00:09:13]  mutual consensus you agree to the terms and condition and you pay the amount and
[00:09:13 -> 00:09:18]  they provide you the services this is not necessary that things should be in
[00:09:18 -> 00:09:24]  the written format it is very easy and quick service and it is a very common
[00:09:24 -> 00:09:28]  example of agreement so remember one thing it is a mutual consensus and it is
[00:09:28 -> 00:09:35]  an informal way of agreement contract common example of contract are non
[00:09:35 -> 00:09:40]  disclosure agreements and user licenses employment contract and accepted
[00:09:40 -> 00:09:45]  purchase order contract very common example of a contract is employment
[00:09:45 -> 00:09:49]  contract for example company offers you some salary and you provide some
[00:09:49 -> 00:09:58]  services of anything software IT anything so employment contract and the
[00:09:58 -> 00:10:02]  NDA or non-disclosure agreements all these are the terms are these are the
[00:10:02 -> 00:10:07]  forms of very formal contract and remember one thing that the contract
[00:10:07 -> 00:10:12]  means that there are some terms and conditions which can be challenged it
[00:10:12 -> 00:10:17]  can be put into a court of law this is the main difference between the
[00:10:17 -> 00:10:22]  agreement and contract because agreement is an informal way and you and the co
[00:10:22 -> 00:10:31]  contract is a very formal and a strict way of terms and condition now the next
[00:10:31 -> 00:10:36]  topic is benefits of agreement remember one thing the primary benefit of an
[00:10:36 -> 00:10:41]  agreement that does not meet the criteria of contract is that it is
[00:10:41 -> 00:10:46]  inherently informal where the agreeing parties have a long-standing
[00:10:46 -> 00:10:52]  relationship and share a considerable degree of trust the use of non-contract
[00:10:52 -> 00:10:57]  agreement can save time and allow for more flexibility in the fulfillment of
[00:10:57 -> 00:11:01]  the agreed upon obligations what does that mean basically remember agreement
[00:11:01 -> 00:11:06]  means the mutual consensus between two or more parties and it is an informal way
[00:11:06 -> 00:11:11]  so it is a very quick and just understand make and understanding
[00:11:11 -> 00:11:17]  between two or more parties and we can start an agreement by agreeing with with
[00:11:17 -> 00:11:22]  with the parties so it is a very informal way and it is a very quick way
[00:11:22 -> 00:11:29]  to and it's also save time or as well and flexible as well so agreement means
[00:11:29 -> 00:11:34]  the understanding mutual consensus between two or more parties it is safe
[00:11:35 -> 00:11:43]  time quick flexible and fulfill the requirements benefits of contract the
[00:11:43 -> 00:11:48]  main advantage of contract is that they spell out the specific terms that the
[00:11:48 -> 00:11:52]  contracting parties have agreed upon and in the event of a breach where one or
[00:11:52 -> 00:11:58]  more parties fail to fulfill their obligations serve as a guide to for a
[00:11:58 -> 00:12:03]  court of law to determine the proper remedy for the injured for the injured
[00:12:03 -> 00:12:09]  party or parties the main benefit of contract is that it is basically a very
[00:12:09 -> 00:12:17]  formal way of mutual consensus and the terms and conditions so in case of any
[00:12:17 -> 00:12:22]  breach of any terms and condition it can be challenged in the court of law so
[00:12:22 -> 00:12:28]  this is basically the very basic and the very major con advantage of a
[00:12:28 -> 00:12:35]  contract that the terms and conditions are very are very strict and in case of
[00:12:35 -> 00:12:42]  any breach from any party so it can be challenged and can be put into a court
[00:12:42 -> 00:12:51]  of law this is the very main and basic advantage of a contract now the PMP exam
[00:12:52 -> 00:12:58]  as if it discuss about with respect to the PMP exam remember one thing that you
[00:12:58 -> 00:13:03]  should expect few questions or multiple choice options related to agreement or
[00:13:03 -> 00:13:10]  contract remember one thing whenever you go for a PMP exam you expect few
[00:13:10 -> 00:13:16]  questions definitely related to agreement and contract so as a as a
[00:13:16 -> 00:13:22]  attempt or as a student of PMP exam you should have a very clear understanding
[00:13:22 -> 00:13:26]  about what is the difference between the agreement and the contract and where
[00:13:26 -> 00:13:30]  should we use the agreement and where should we use the contract so this is
[00:13:30 -> 00:13:36]  very necessary to understand the concept of agreement and contract and in
[00:13:36 -> 00:13:43]  whenever you are going to give the exam of PMP you should expect a few questions
[00:13:43 -> 00:13:47]  specifically related to agreement or contract and especially in the multiple
[00:13:47 -> 00:13:52]  choice options of answers you would definitely see the term agreement and
[00:13:52 -> 00:13:56]  contract so if you have a clear understanding to understand the
[00:13:56 -> 00:14:00]  difference between agreement and contract and what are the consequences
[00:14:00 -> 00:14:06]  of agreement or contract you can use it properly more questions you should
[00:14:06 -> 00:14:11]  expect related to project charter as well because the project charter is also
[00:14:11 -> 00:14:16]  a type of a contract basically signed by a company and by project manager so
[00:14:16 -> 00:14:22]  you should expect few questions as well related to project charter as well as a
[00:14:22 -> 00:14:27]  project manager you should have a clear understanding of agreement and contract
[00:14:27 -> 00:14:34]  because see if as you know that you are if you are a project manager and also
[00:14:34 -> 00:14:40]  executing some projects so you should have a knowledge about the difference
[00:14:40 -> 00:14:44]  between the agreement and contract you should know that where to use the
[00:14:44 -> 00:14:48]  agreement and what were to use the contract and as a project manager you
[00:14:48 -> 00:14:53]  should have the clear understanding of contract because the contract has the
[00:14:53 -> 00:14:57]  scope of a project and the terms and conditions which could be
[00:14:57 -> 00:15:02]  applied anywhere so you should have a very clear understanding of a contract
[00:15:02 -> 00:15:08]  you should read it properly so that you can use it properly in the project so
[00:15:09 -> 00:15:14]  with respect to PMP exam with respect to project management or if you are going
[00:15:14 -> 00:15:18]  to give exam of PMP you should have a clear understanding of agreement and
[00:15:18 -> 00:15:23]  contract or if you are already a PMP certified person or you are already a
[00:15:23 -> 00:15:28]  project manager or executing a project so you should have understanding of
[00:15:28 -> 00:15:34]  agreement and contract that how we can use the agreement and contract and what
[00:15:34 -> 00:15:38]  is the basically purpose of agreement and contract remember one thing always
[00:15:38 -> 00:15:42]  remember one thing the agreement is basically a mutual consensus between two
[00:15:42 -> 00:15:48]  or more parties and it is an informal way contract is basically mutual
[00:15:48 -> 00:15:52]  consensus between two or more parties but it is a formal way and it can be
[00:15:52 -> 00:15:57]  challenged it can be put into a court of law if any party breach the terms and
[00:15:57 -> 00:16:02]  conditions so this is basically the major major main difference between
[00:16:02 -> 00:16:09]  agreement and contract so friend I hope you like this video I have tried my
[00:16:09 -> 00:16:14]  level best to explain the concept of agreement and contract
[00:16:14 -> 00:16:19]  and I have tried my level best to give you and share my knowledge with you if
[00:16:19 -> 00:16:24]  you still have any question you can please ask from me on and comment on
