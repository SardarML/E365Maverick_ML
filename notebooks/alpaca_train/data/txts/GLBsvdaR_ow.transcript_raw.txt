 Hey, what's up guys? This is my second video in the linguistics 100 video series and in this series  I'm gonna take you through every aspect of linguistics  So you're gonna have a good foundation and all the basics of what it means to study languages  This video is on phonetics, which is the study of speech sounds in the last video  It was a basic introduction of what linguistics is and now we're honing in on really the most basic  Aspect of linguistics the most basic thing we can study as far as language go is  The speech sound in future videos. We're gonna work our way up through studying syllables words sentences  But in this video we want to focus mainly on the sound  now  Phonetics, like I said phonetics is the scientific study of human speech sounds and there's three different ways that you can study  Speech sounds or three different areas really there's articulatory phonetics  Which is the study of what exactly it is that human beings do with our tongues our lips our throats our lungs  Exactly what you do when you're producing speech sounds  Acoustic phonetics is the study of the actual sound waves that are passing through the air  The frequency the amplitude the different properties of the sound waves and auditory phonetics is the study of  What happens when those sound waves reach your the ear of the person that's listening?  we're going to focus mainly on articulatory phonetics in this course because  That's the one that's most useful to language learners  Articulatory phonetics. All right. Now when studying the movements and the motions of your vocal tract and all your articulators  Phoneticians have a lot of really advanced technology. They use ultrasounds  X-rays  They put little things in your mouth and little cameras and they can view they can do all kinds of really advanced stuff to tell  What you're doing with your tongue with your lips with your throat  You probably don't have any of those things and that's fine  If you have a mirror or a camera to watch yourself in  That's gonna allow you to do some pretty interesting stuff as well  There have been some very embarrassing moments when I was at school after my phonetics class looking in the mirror going  And someone walks in of course because I was trying to study what I was doing with my tongue and my lips  When I pronounce different vowels and stuff  But if you have a mirror that you can look at yourself in in the bathroom or wherever you are  Then you'll be able to see some of the things I'm talking about  When you produce these speech sounds and it'll be a lot of some stuff that you've never actually thought about. All right classifying speech sounds  Most human speech sounds can be classified can be classified with just three criteria and that's voicing status  Place of articulation place of articulation and manner of articulation gosh for someone who's talking about speech sounds  I'm really stumbling over my words in this video. I think I need some water  And so three criteria for for describing speech sounds if you know  Each of these criteria for a given speech sound then, you know exactly what that speech sound is  And we're gonna go over each of these in more detail now the first of which is a voicing  All right, and we're gonna go over this first because it's the easiest to understand  Voicing means are your vocal cords vibrating and the way to tell this is very easy  take your hand and put it right on your throat on your Adam's apple and  If you can feel your book, you'll be able to feel your vocal cords vibrating with your hand if they are vibrating  So let's go through some of these sounds right here where it says voiceless sounds. So we got  Did you feel your voice did you feel your vocal cords vibrating with your hand when you did that  Let's move on to the the next set of sounds  That  S in Asia is not pronounced like a normal S. It's  but anyways  When you're pronouncing these the second set of sounds you should feel your vocal cords vibrating with your hand  There's a very pronounced difference between those two sounds  and what we have here is  Two sets of sounds that are exactly the same in every way  Except for in voicing. So the s sound  Is exactly the same as the Z sound?  She is exactly the same as  and  Are exactly the same sound they differ only in voicing so I guess I shouldn't say they're exactly the same sound  They're almost exactly the same sound  That's voicing if your vocal cords are vibrating right there then you have a voiced sound  Place of articulation is the next criteria. We're gonna need to know in order to describe speech sounds and  place of articulation just means  What place in your mouth is a constriction taking place to cause that sound we have  bilabial sounds which are  Labial meaning lips and by meaning to so bilabial means that both of your lips are together  Labial dental means your lips are against your teeth  actually, I'm gonna skip this slide because  This will take us to our next slide and I'm gonna give you a little detail about  each each place of articulation  So in bilabials both of your lips are together  the only bilabials we have in English are buh puh and  Mmm, and you can see in the chart here and the little we have a sagittal view of the face  The lips are together, which is causing an obstruction to the airflow  Our next place of articulation is labial dental obviously again labial meaning lips dental meaning  Teeth so in labial dental sounds your upper teeth are pressed against your lower lips like this  In interdental sounds inter meaning between so you can tell these are pretty intuitive names  Interdental means that your tongue is going to be between your lips. So  And in English we spell those two sounds the same way, but they are two very different sounds one is voiced the other is voiceless  Alveolar sounds. All right. Now your alveolar Ridge is a portion of your mouth that is right behind your teeth  You can't see it in the video  But you might be able to touch it and then feel it  Or do it with your tongue if you don't want to stick your finger in your mouth  You can see it here in the sagittal diagram  And the tongue is just just touching right behind the the teeth and that's your alveolar Ridge right there  So we have a lot of alveolar sounds in English. That's to do  mmm, oh and er  All right, then we have velar sounds  velar sounds are gonna take place in the back of your mouth and  So with the other sounds you're using the front tip of your tongue. This one is gonna have  The body or the back of your tongue going up against your velum  Which is towards the back of your mouth and we have three velar sounds in English. That's good and  Being like at the word end of the word song right that's not two different letters  That's not an N and a G combined. That's one sound it's  And that's just an example of a few different  Places of articulation we have in English. There are more and there are other places that are not used in English  But I just wanted to give you the main ones in this video  The next criteria that we need to know about in order to describe speech sounds is manner of articulation  And that just has to do with how the air is passing through your vocal tract  place of articulation  Talks about where in your mouth the constriction is taking place  The manner of articulation is really talking about what kind of constriction or what kind of obstruction to the airflow  Is inherent to that speech sound and I have a few different types of speech sounds here on the side  We're gonna go over these in a little more detail  Stops. All right. Let's do an experiment really quick  Let's pretend you're gonna have a competition with a friend to see who could hold out an S song for S sound for the longest  and  that competition would go something like  Until you run out of air and you could do the same thing with a vowel ah  Until you run out of air or  You could do it with a bunch of speech sounds try doing it with a B  But  right  The point of a stop sound is that all the air in your vocal tract is it actually comes to a complete stop?  So for these sounds you're going to have a complete obstruction of air  And so the stop sounds in English that we have are but put the to good and could  Fricatives are  Close to stops, but not quite with a stop you act you have  Some closure of your vocal tract that completely stops air with a fricative  You have a very narrow space that allows air to go through but you're gonna get kind of a hissing  Friction II sound and the friction and the the fricatives we have in English are  That last one is what kind of interesting  Just sounds like you're sort of breathing a little bit  But there actually is some friction going on in your throat there, so that's why it's a fricative all right  Nasals are a little bit more difficult to describe technically, so what happens in a nasal is  You're gonna lower the back of your your velum  So that it allows air to pass up through your nasal cavity and out your nose  Meaning that if you plug your nose you can't produce nasal sounds I  Guess you can pronounce them a little bit, but after a while that air is gonna build up and  It won't be able to exit out of your nose  You also should be able to feel if you put your finger right there when  Pronouncing some of these nasal sounds you should be able to feel a little bit of air  And there's no air coming out of your mouth because  You're necessarily going to have to make some closure in your mouth for to have a nasal consonant  So with an M  You're closing it off at your lips with an N. You're closing it off right here at your alveolar Ridge  And then with mmm. You're closing it off  You're closing off your mouth in the back of your mouth with the back of your tongue  And so that's what causes nasal sounds you're actually putting air through your nose because it can't escape through your mouth  So  Mainly we've been talking about different ways of producing consonants so far in this video  I want to talk about vowels a little bit vowels can also be described  Using just three criteria. That's frontness height and lip rounding now. You can see here in this  in  This picture that I have on the side  It's another sagittal view of the mouth, and I have a little  Square a little quadrilateral right in the middle of the mouth and that quadra quadrilateral  Corresponds to the position of the tongue when producing vowels now with consonants you have some kind of obstruction or constriction to the airflow  That is hindering the air a little bit, but with vowels  They're much more open and much more free for the air to come out  And it's only a matter of where your tongue is located in your mouth. That's going to shape the sound that you're producing  So with ah and ah  Your tongue is going to be at the lower  portion of your mouth with e and a it's going to be in the front of the mouth with ooh and  It's going to be in the back of the mouth and with uh and uh it's going to be right around the center of your  mouth  So we can divide  We can divide this this quadrilateral into two axes  Which ranges from front to back and low to high and then the only other  Criteria we need for determining  Speech sounds is lip rounding so with ooh  Your lips are round and with e you can see your lips spread out  And so these are the three criteria that we need for describing vowels  articulatory  Like I said, you only need three you only need three attributes to be able to  unambiguously  describe a speech sound  For example, there's one voiced labial nasal sound and that's mmm  Okay, no other sound can be described as voiced bilabial nasal  there's only one low back low back vowel, that's ah  Um, there's no like there you just that only describes one sound  And we'll be able to describe a whole range of sounds using just these three criteria  Well three four consonants and three four vowels  But if every time we want to refer to a certain sound we have to use these big long scientific words  That's gonna get really cumbersome really quick  So we have a shortcut for cutting down the amount of time that it takes to describe a certain sound  and that is  the IPA  You may have seen this in dictionaries where they use a bunch of symbols that you don't understand  Some of them look like they're English letters and some of them look like they're made up  That's the International Phonetic Alphabet  And  What we do for with the International Alphabet is that we will assign one speech sound  One symbol so it's a lot easier than English where you have letters like C that can be pronounced as or as  you have letters like T that can be pronounced like the T in ambition or the key T and cat or the T and  Train which sounds like it starts with a CH for some reason  all kinds of different TH of T sounds  But it's not that way with the IPA. We have one symbol per sound  And so rather than writing out  bilabial voiceless stop  All you have to do is just write the one symbol and we're gonna go over some of these symbols now really quick  Some symbols in the IPA are already familiar to you. And these are the symbols down here in the bottom left corner  we have  There are some other symbols that you're probably not familiar with  Or they represent sounds that you would probably not expect them to  For example, the R sound looks like an upside-down R in the IPA  The CH sound looks like a T and I have kind of a weird stretched out S  J is a D and this I  Don't know how you would describe that symbol. But after that we have sh as in shoe, but you know  Stretched out s we have the J as in Asia or like, you know  It's a very common sound in French Jacques or Jean the J in the IPA is  Pronounced the way that we would expect to pronounce a Y in English. So  For words like yes, or you those are gonna be spelt with a J in the IPA and then finally we have  Like I said earlier the the sound at the end of the word song is  That's one sound we spell it with two letters, but it's a single sound and it's not a G. It's not an N  We don't say song  That sounds really weird  It's a single sound and it's pronounced like an N except at the back of your throat  Or the back of your your mouth, so it's a velar sound  Moving on to the vowels if you speak any of the Romance languages  Then this might be a little bit more intuitive  the the sounds  That the IPA uses don't necessarily  Correspond exactly to the way we would pronounce them in English. So for example, this first one is e then we have a  And if we have a lowercase e and an uppercase I then that would be pronounced as a  This backwards three looking thing is a then this next symbol is called ash we call that it's pronounced as a  The next one that sort of looks like an uppercase a without the line in the middle  And we call that a wedge and it's pronounced as ah and the next the symbol is interesting  This is a schwa and it's pronounced  It's very similar to the wedge and if you can't if you have trouble telling the difference between these two sounds that's okay  Even a lot of linguists and phoneticians have a hard time hearing the difference between those two sounds  But the wedge would be used in words like up the schwa would be used in words like about  And you can tell if you listen really carefully when I say up  That's a stronger ah sound and in about  It's a weaker and it's it's a very similar sound, but it's just not quite the same  We have a schwa which is  kind of an R colored vowel and this is a  really  Hard to grasp area of phonetics  Vowels whenever our follows a vowel they just they sound weird to me  But the schwa would be pronounced as er and that is a vowel  And then we have ah as in hot ah  As in caught if you're from, California, you might not have two different vowels here  So if you would say the word cat COT as in the small folding bed and the word caught  C-a-u-g-h-t  As in I caught the ball you might pronounce those two words the same and that's okay  But  So so the word so the difference between those two words would be cut and caught  And the difference between the two sounds is ah and ah ah ah it would took me a long time to be able to hear the  Difference, but I after a lot of practice listening. I did realize that I do pronounce those differently  moving on to Oh  That's what Oh looks like then looks kind of like a horseshoe and then ooh as in you  so after we have learned all of these  all of these  international phonetic alphabet symbols  You should be able to write out anything you would want to write in your language, and it takes a lot of practice  I've only described the main  Speech sounds in English. There's a lot more in the actual  IPA vowel chart and  the consonant chart  So you're gonna have if you're learning a foreign language  You're gonna have to look up those sounds in that language  But for now now that we have a basis in English, we should be able to pronounce  These sentences here. And this first one is I fart in your general direction  The second one is Romans go home. And the third one is  Your hovercraft is full of eels  So that's all I have for this video  I hope it interests you and it gives you a good understanding of how phonetics works  There's a lot more that I could have said that I just didn't fit into this video  I encourage you to look up the speech sounds that are used in your target language and figure out exactly  How those sounds are produced and now you have the tools to do so
