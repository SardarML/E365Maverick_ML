[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  In 1802, a person named Ludwig Post was out on an uninhabited beach in Long Island, New
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:09]  York. He was out there to hunt. He was riding a horse, he was accompanied by hounds, they
[00:00:09 -> 00:00:14]  were in pursuit of a fox, and he was leading an entire hunting party. Now, they identified
[00:00:14 -> 00:00:18]  a particular fox and they were chasing it, but as they got close, another individual,
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:24]  Jesse Pearson, who was not a part of Post's hunting party, came onto the scene, promptly
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:28]  killed the fox, and carried it off. Post was upset about this, but instead of just dealing
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:34]  it as an interpersonal matter, Post sued. Post went to court and essentially argued
[00:00:34 -> 00:00:38]  that the fox that they were chasing belonged to him, that Pearson had trespassed on his
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:43]  property by essentially killing and taking off the fox. He argued, as a result, that
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:47]  he was entitled to damages, that they should pay money to him, and that he should be given
[00:00:47 -> 00:00:51]  back the possession of the fox itself. Pearson, on the other hand, the individual who had
[00:00:51 -> 00:00:55]  killed the fox, countered by arguing that the fox hadn't belonged to anyone at the
[00:00:55 -> 00:01:00]  time that it was being chased, that he was the first to catch it, and only then did someone
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:06]  acquire ownership over the fox, and that was him, Pearson. What should be the outcome of
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:11]  this case? Who owns the fox, and when was that ownership acquired? And how should this
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:17]  decision be made? Now, at first glance, Pearson v. Post, also commonly known as the Fox Case,
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:22]  appears to be nothing more than a petty squabble between two contentious hunters. But the case
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:27]  also illustrates many of the issues that are behind property law. Now, property, at
[00:01:27 -> 00:01:32]  its most basic level, is the law about how we allocate, manage, and protect control over
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:38]  valued resources. We do so by essentially recognizing certain things as property, and
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:43]  we assign control by granting someone ownership over that property. Now, property is taught
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:48]  in the first year of law school because it's considered a foundational course to understanding
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:53]  various other fields of law. And in fact, one can argue that property is the most foundational
[00:01:53 -> 00:01:58]  in terms of law itself. It's hard to determine, for example, whether or not a contract of
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:04]  sale for a good is good without really understanding whether or not someone even has property ownership
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:08]  over the thing that's being sold. We can't really make a determination about whether
[00:02:08 -> 00:02:14]  a criminal law over property has been violated, such as theft or arson, without determining
[00:02:14 -> 00:02:19]  whether or not someone has property over such a thing and what that interference actually
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:24]  entails in essentially constituting a crime. And various constitutional rights dealing
[00:02:24 -> 00:02:29]  with property, let's say due process over deprivation of property or just compensation
[00:02:29 -> 00:02:34]  for the taking of property, can't really be managed or really made sense of without
[00:02:34 -> 00:02:40]  understanding what the basic idea of property is. But as Pearson v. Post illustrates, just
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:44]  because property is foundational doesn't mean that it's clear or easy. Going back
[00:02:44 -> 00:02:49]  to the case in Pearson v. Post, we're dealing with a fox. And in some ways, the most basic
[00:02:49 -> 00:02:53]  questions that arise out of this is what is the property itself and whether or not something
[00:02:53 -> 00:02:59]  can actually be property? Can a fox be owned? We take it for a given, of course, that land
[00:02:59 -> 00:03:03]  and certain things can be owned. Now, of course, in different times and in different countries,
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:08]  that's not always the case. But can you actually own a fox? Does it make a difference if it's
[00:03:08 -> 00:03:13]  wild or domesticated? Does it make a difference if it's alive or dead, locked in a cage or
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:19]  running free? And where is the line? If we can own living things, can we own people?
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:25]  How about one's organs or genetic code? Should one's likeness or personality or even reputation
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:31]  be considered property? How about an idea that someone has or an invention? And assuming
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:35]  that something can be owned, how do we acquire ownership over that? And of course, if we're
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:39]  talking about certain activities that one does in order to acquire ownership, should
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:44]  we be rewarding certain activities as opposed to others? How does something get transformed
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:49]  into property? What kind of activities are we privileging? Going back to Pearson v. Post,
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:54]  should Post prevail because of all of his investment and labor? After all, he raised
[00:03:54 -> 00:03:59]  the horses, he trained them, along with the hounds. He was the one that was giving chase.
[00:03:59 -> 00:04:04]  He was the one that was doing all the work. Or maybe he should own it because his intentions
[00:04:04 -> 00:04:09]  and expectations of capturing the fox was so close. He was almost already there. On
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:12]  the other hand, if we're looking at results, it was ultimately Pearson that killed the
[00:04:12 -> 00:04:16]  fox. He was the first one to actually close the deal. And in some ways, if we're talking
[00:04:16 -> 00:04:20]  about being able to exercise control over something as property, he was the first one
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:25]  to actually take possession of the fox, the one to actually be able to be in a position
[00:04:25 -> 00:04:30]  to even exercise the type of control that we usually associate with property. Of course,
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:34]  property is not just about the thing. It's just not about whether or not the fox can
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:38]  be owned. Property is also about the owner of the fox. It's connected to a person. A
[00:04:38 -> 00:04:43]  basic idea of property, of course, is that a person has certain ownership and control
[00:04:43 -> 00:04:47]  and certain rights over a particular thing. In this case, the fox is not important just
[00:04:47 -> 00:04:53]  because it's a fox, because of its fur or because of meat. Because the property itself
[00:04:53 -> 00:04:57]  is connected to an individual, we also have to understand in some ways the meaning of
[00:04:57 -> 00:05:02]  that property to the individual and what it means for that particular individual themselves.
[00:05:02 -> 00:05:06]  After all, the litigation costs in this particular case, raising it all the way up to the New
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:11]  York Supreme Court, is much more than the value of the fox itself. This may seem irrational,
[00:05:11 -> 00:05:16]  but of course, for the litigants in the case, this was vitally important to them. It represented
[00:05:16 -> 00:05:21]  to a certain degree their pride. It represented their activities. It represented what it meant
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:26]  to them to go out and hunt foxes. The fox, in some cases, has more meaning than just
[00:05:26 -> 00:05:30]  the item itself. It's connected to the individual. And in some ways, a lot of various aspects
[00:05:30 -> 00:05:35]  of property has this particular feature. We don't talk about a house as just bricks
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:39]  and wood. We talk about, in some ways, as what it means to a particular person that
[00:05:39 -> 00:05:44]  owns it. Shelter, of course, is a necessity of life. To have that shelter means that person
[00:05:44 -> 00:05:49]  can live. But also, in some ways, a house is a home. It has significance beyond just
[00:05:49 -> 00:05:53]  what it does in terms of sheltering an individual. Just as a broken stopwatch may be worthless
[00:05:53 -> 00:05:58]  on the open market, for the owner, that may be invaluable as an heirloom. It may be filled
[00:05:58 -> 00:06:02]  with memories. How does the law account for that? How do we recognize it when we're dealing
[00:06:02 -> 00:06:07]  with issues among individuals over the law? And once we recognize that property is more
[00:06:07 -> 00:06:12]  than just about the thing, and it's connected, in some ways, to an individual, then we're
[00:06:12 -> 00:06:17]  also talking about social relationships. Fox's case was not just about who had ownership
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:22]  over the fox. It was, in some ways, about the relative activities and relationship between
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:27]  Pearson and Post. By claiming property over the fox, Post was asserting not just he had
[00:06:27 -> 00:06:32]  a right to the fox, but that Pearson had a duty not to interfere with his activity,
[00:06:32 -> 00:06:38]  with his pursuit and his hunt. And how a court rules on a particular case like Pearson versus
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:44]  Post is not just important to Pearson or even Post. It, in some ways, sets up a rule that
[00:06:44 -> 00:06:49]  would be then applicable going forward in society. And whether or not that rule is accepted
[00:06:49 -> 00:06:53]  by society in general may determine whether or not that particular rule works and people
[00:06:53 -> 00:06:58]  turn to the legal system or people turn to extra-legal means such as violence in order
[00:06:58 -> 00:07:03]  to resolve their particular disputes. And in this case, we also recognize the broader
[00:07:03 -> 00:07:06]  societal implications of property law, not just in determining the rights of the two
[00:07:06 -> 00:07:12]  individuals. Whether or not we have a society in which property is unevenly allocated may
[00:07:12 -> 00:07:16]  affect, in some ways, our understanding of democracy or the sense of justice or equity
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:22]  in a particular society. Whether a store owner who has a ownership of a particular store
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:27]  has the right to exclude someone on the basis of their race, for example, may not just define
[00:07:27 -> 00:07:31]  whether or not a particular individual may be harmed based on their race, but whether
[00:07:31 -> 00:07:36]  or not we have a society that is based on our understanding of racial categories and
[00:07:36 -> 00:07:40]  hierarchies. In other words, property is not just about the thing or about the individual
[00:07:40 -> 00:07:45]  who owns it. In some ways, it's about the broader societal context in which the property
[00:07:45 -> 00:07:50]  rule then constructs through how it operates through the law. With that said, what we're
[00:07:50 -> 00:07:54]  going to do in this particular course is go through not only these questions, but through
[00:07:54 -> 00:07:58]  them understand the basics of property law and its significance. We're going to look
[00:07:58 -> 00:08:02]  at what is property, what rights go along with property, and how the court enforces
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:06]  them. We're also going to look at the broader stakes that are involved in when we think
[00:08:06 -> 00:08:10]  about property, how we organize our society, what it means to have certain rules as opposed
[00:08:10 -> 00:08:15]  to others. And of course, important to all law students, through answering these questions
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:19]  and looking at these doctrines and cases, we're going to develop different ways of
[00:08:19 -> 00:08:23]  making legal arguments. And not just because legal arguments are important to winning a
[00:08:23 -> 00:08:28]  particular case, but the arguments themselves also illustrate the stakes and consequences
[00:08:28 -> 00:08:32]  that are at play when we're talking about property. In some ways, in making the property
[00:08:32 -> 00:08:36]  arguments, we are having a broader discussion and debate about how we think property should
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:40]  be integrated into our broader society and what is important and what is not. By the
[00:08:40 -> 00:08:46]  way, if you're curious about Pearson versus Post, Pearson won. The court ruled essentially
[00:08:46 -> 00:08:50]  that just by chasing the fox, even with all that investment, it wasn't sufficient. You
[00:08:50 -> 00:08:54]  actually had to take physical possession. In that case, Pearson was the one that did
[00:08:54 -> 00:08:54]  it.
