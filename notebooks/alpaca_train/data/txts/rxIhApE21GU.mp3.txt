[00:00:00 -> 00:00:18]  Fractions are used to describe parts of wholes mainly. Here I have a circle drawn and I have
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:24]  subdivided the circle into four sections and I have shaded three of them. Now let's talk
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:30]  about a fraction that would describe the part of the circle which is shaded. Now notice
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:36]  that three parts are shaded out of all four parts. The fraction describing the situation
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:43]  is three over four or three-fourths. Now the top number, the three, is called the numerator
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:49]  of the fraction and the bottom number, four, is called the denominator. The numerator tells
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:56]  how many items we have and the denominator tells how many items are in a whole. So we
[00:00:56 -> 00:01:03]  have three items shaded out of four items in the entire circle. That's the idea. So
[00:01:03 -> 00:01:10]  three-fourths. Now fractions actually come in several forms. These are examples of proper
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:16]  fractions. Now the prevailing characteristic here with proper fractions, take a look at
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:20]  the size of the numerator and denominator in all of these. What you notice is that the
[00:01:20 -> 00:01:27]  numerator is smaller in every one of these. The numerator is smaller than the denominator.
[00:01:27 -> 00:01:36]  You see, so in all of these cases, these describe a piece of a whole, truly a part of a whole
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:43]  because the bottom number describes how many are in a whole. You see, one whole item of
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:48]  whatever we're talking about here and we have a number in the numerator which is smaller
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:54]  than that, so parts of wholes. These are called improper fractions and in each one of those,
[00:01:54 -> 00:01:59]  the numerator is a number which is larger than the denominator. That's the prevailing
[00:01:59 -> 00:02:05]  characteristic in improper fractions. It would also be improper if we had a fraction with
[00:02:05 -> 00:02:11]  a numerator which was the same number as the denominator. But most often, if we see improper
[00:02:11 -> 00:02:16]  fractions, they are like this. The numerator is a bigger number than the denominator. Now
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:23]  in improper fractions, these are fractions which are describing value that is larger
[00:02:23 -> 00:02:30]  than a whole because after all, in five-thirds, five is a number of items we have and a one
[00:02:30 -> 00:02:36]  whole item contains three items, you see, contains three of these. So we have more than
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:43]  a whole for all of these. These are examples of mixed numbers. Mixed numbers are numbers
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:48]  that are composed of a whole numbered part and a fraction part and we read them like
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:52]  this. This is read three and one-half. Notice the word and between the whole numbered part
[00:02:52 -> 00:02:58]  and the fraction part. This is read two and two-fifths. This is read four and one-eighth.
[00:02:58 -> 00:03:05]  This is read one and one-fourth. It turns out that improper fractions and mixed numbers
[00:03:06 -> 00:03:13]  can be describing the same value. And let's take a look at that situation. I have drawn
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:20]  here three circles and in this circle, I have divided into four parts. In fact, in all of
[00:03:20 -> 00:03:24]  them, I have divided the circles into four parts. And here, all four parts are shaded.
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:29]  Here, all four parts are shaded. And here, only one of the four parts is shaded. We can
[00:03:29 -> 00:03:34]  actually describe the situation that we see here in two different ways. One having to
[00:03:34 -> 00:03:40]  do with or related to the idea of improper fraction and the other having to do with the
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:45]  notion of mixed number. Let's take a look at what I'm talking about. If we think about
[00:03:45 -> 00:03:52]  the number of little pieces that are shaded, the number of fourths that are shaded, I have
[00:03:53 -> 00:04:00]  four-fourths here, another four-fourths here for a total of eight-fourths that are shaded
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:06]  in those two circles, and another one-fourth over here. So, that's a total of nine-fourths
[00:04:06 -> 00:04:13]  that are shaded in all three circles. So, nine-fourths is an improper fraction that
[00:04:13 -> 00:04:19]  can be used to describe the shaded parts of all of these circles. Now, let's look at the
[00:04:19 -> 00:04:26]  situation another way. We've got, let's see, we've got one whole circle shaded here. We've
[00:04:27 -> 00:04:34]  got one whole circle here, that's two whole circles, plus we've got one-fourth of another
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:41]  circle. So, we have two and one-fourth circles that are shaded. So, the shaded portions of
[00:04:43 -> 00:04:50]  these circles can be described using the mixed number two and one-fourth. Now, if it is the
[00:04:51 -> 00:04:58]  case that nine-fourths can be replaced by, or has the same value as, or is equal to two
[00:05:01 -> 00:05:08]  and one-fourth, then there must be a way for us to convert nine-fourths into two and one-fourth,
[00:05:08 -> 00:05:13]  and a way for us to convert two and one-fourth into nine-fourths. And let's talk about that
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:18]  a little bit. There are a couple of ways of looking at the situation going in that direction.
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:22]  That is, in changing nine-fourths to two and a quarter, two and one-fourth, we can
[00:05:22 -> 00:05:28]  think this way. We can think, well, gee, let's look at the circles for a moment. Here, the
[00:05:28 -> 00:05:35]  shaded business can be described as four-fourths. If we were going to write a fraction involving
[00:05:36 -> 00:05:43]  this, because after all, we have four shaded regions out of a total of four in the whole
[00:05:43 -> 00:05:50]  circle. And here, for this other one, we also have four-fourths, you see, for the shaded
[00:05:50 -> 00:05:57]  part. And in this third circle, we have one-fourth. Now, four-fourths is the whole circle that's
[00:05:58 -> 00:06:03]  shaded here, and four-fourths here is the whole circle. We have one circle here, one
[00:06:03 -> 00:06:09]  whole circle here, and one-fourth of a circle here. So we have two and one-fourth. See,
[00:06:09 -> 00:06:15]  two and one-fourth. But there must be a better way to show it. This is a nice little illustration,
[00:06:15 -> 00:06:22]  but maybe there's another way. And there certainly is. And that way is an arithmetic process.
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:26]  And it's a process that works like this. Remember in the last chapter when we talked about whole
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:33]  numbers, we said that in the division process, we can request the division of whole numbers
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:38]  using a fraction. And if we just think about it like that, think about the fraction like
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:45]  this. This is nine divided by four. You see, now, so this is a fraction bar, but it also
[00:06:46 -> 00:06:51]  is a request for division, or it can be thought of like that in order to make the change from
[00:06:51 -> 00:06:56]  improper fraction to mixed numbers. So we have, let's see, nine divided by four, well,
[00:06:56 -> 00:07:03]  that's four into nine. Let's see, four into nine goes two times. Two times four is eight.
[00:07:04 -> 00:07:11]  We subtract and get one. So we have two wholes, you see, in this process, but one left over.
[00:07:12 -> 00:07:18]  So we have two with one left over. Now that left over one, the remainder, is written on
[00:07:18 -> 00:07:24]  top of the divisor to complete the fraction part of our mixed number. So this is written
[00:07:24 -> 00:07:31]  as one-fourth, two and one-fourth, you see. So we have a whole numbered part and a fraction
[00:07:32 -> 00:07:39]  part. The fraction part comes from the remainder over the divisor in this situation. So a good
[00:07:39 -> 00:07:43]  way then to change an improper fraction to a mixed number. Now let's go back the other
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:48]  way. In going the other way, in changing a mixed number to an improper fraction, once
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:53]  again, we can think in several different ways. The two that we have here, we could subdivide
[00:07:53 -> 00:08:00]  that into one and one and one-fourth. You see, and if we want to describe this in terms
[00:08:00 -> 00:08:07]  of fourths, you see, we're talking about the entire circle, or four-fourths of the circle,
[00:08:08 -> 00:08:15]  four-fourths of this circle, and one-fourth, and four, four, how many fourths do we have?
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:21]  You see, we have a total of nine-fourths in this situation. That's a way to look at it.
[00:08:21 -> 00:08:28]  But I think a better way is like this. We can actually say that, well, I'm going to,
[00:08:29 -> 00:08:33]  I'll show you the fast track way here, and then we'll talk about it a little bit. But
[00:08:33 -> 00:08:39]  it's to multiply four times two to get eight, and then add one. So it's, you're kind of
[00:08:39 -> 00:08:46]  going like this. Four times two to get eight, and then you add the one to get nine-fourths.
[00:08:50 -> 00:08:54]  That's the manipulative process. When you multiply four times two to get eight, what
[00:08:54 -> 00:09:01]  you're doing is you're calculating the number of fourths there are in two. You see, every
[00:09:02 -> 00:09:06]  one of these rascals, every one of these whole numbers, every whole number that's in two
[00:09:06 -> 00:09:13]  has four-fourths. So the total number of fourths that we have are, we have a fourth, we have
[00:09:14 -> 00:09:20]  four-fourths in every one of these. So four times two would be eight-fourths for the two
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:25]  in the whole-numbered part. And then we add the one-fourth for a total of nine-fourths
[00:09:25 -> 00:09:32]  describing all of the shaded regions. Okay. Let's practice the idea of changing from mixed-number
[00:09:32 -> 00:09:39]  to improper fraction, improper fraction to mixed-number. In these, we want to change,
[00:09:50 -> 00:09:58]  we want to change the division problem. And if we go through the division, we will be
