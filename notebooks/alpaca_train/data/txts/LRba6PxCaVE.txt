[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  For the past few years, I've been slowly transforming my yard into a proper cottage garden.
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:08]  However, this is not the first cottage garden I've grown.
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:15]  If you have seen my old videos, you have witnessed how I transformed my last place from nondescript lawn into a lush and wild cottage garden.
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:18]  It took years to get to this stage of maturity.
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:26]  That's because I like to expand a garden slowly, working with what's available around me, propagating the plants from seed and cuttings whenever possible,
[00:00:26 -> 00:00:29]  and letting the plants find their own voice in this space.
[00:00:29 -> 00:00:32]  This means I've spent very little money to make this happen.
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:36]  Buying plants from nurseries can be convenient, but tends to be expensive as well.
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:45]  Even if budget is not an issue for you, the process of watching plants grow from seed to slowly flesh out the garden is in itself rewarding, and frankly, priceless.
[00:00:45 -> 00:00:48]  It helps us grow as gardeners as well.
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:52]  In this short series on garden design, I'll show how you can see your space through a new lens,
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:57]  sharing tips I've picked up over the years on how to shape your dream garden into reality.
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:04]  In this video, we'll focus on structure.
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:10]  In other words, how to organize the backbone of your garden into a beautiful and practical space.
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:15]  I started with a side garden that links the front of the house to the back, where the kitchen is.
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:18]  I envisioned an edible cottage garden.
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:22]  Therefore, I wanted to build several garden beds where I could raise salad greens and other vegetables.
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:26]  So I laid out the square beds on a grid, aligning them to the house.
[00:01:26 -> 00:01:30]  They would need to be protected from groundhogs and deer that roam the area.
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:40]  After much thought and some sketching in 3D, I settled on this vintage gazebo-like structure with removable chicken wire panels to house the most tasty greens.
[00:01:40 -> 00:01:46]  Eventually, I would subdivide the garden to separate rooms with fences, but this ensured added protection.
[00:01:46 -> 00:01:53]  I had in mind French kitchen gardens called potager and English cottage gardens as inspiration.
[00:01:54 -> 00:01:58]  My goal was to infuse this area with sense of place.
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:04]  It's a hard concept to define clearly, but we do recognize it immediately once we experience such places.
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:07]  Think of the most beloved spaces in the world.
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:14]  Be it Venice with its Renaissance architecture with human-sized decoration, narrow alleys and reflective canals that exude mystery.
[00:02:14 -> 00:02:19]  Washington D.C. or Paris with regal, tree-framed, broad boulevards.
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:23]  Puginato's impressive mountains and jungle encrusted by city life.
[00:02:23 -> 00:02:26]  Salvador's colorful, cascading Baroque homes and churches.
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:30]  Morocco's labyrinthine marketplaces and rich courtyards.
[00:02:30 -> 00:02:33]  Or India's splendid Taj Mahal.
[00:02:33 -> 00:02:40]  These spaces exude a sense of place not only because their rich culture and history are reflected on the built environment,
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:45]  but because the arrangement of space itself is cohesive, balanced, and specific.
[00:02:45 -> 00:02:49]  They are the opposite of what has been called liminal spaces.
[00:02:49 -> 00:02:56]  Liminal spaces or spaces of passing through have recently trended online in video and photo sharing platforms
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:04]  because they elicit a rather uneasy nostalgia from a generation who has grown up living outside of spaces with a sense of place.
[00:03:06 -> 00:03:09]  They are what I call spaces of unbelonging.
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:13]  In them, it feels like you're anywhere and nowhere at the same time.
[00:03:14 -> 00:03:21]  Airport corridors, office hallways, blank courtyards, highway embankments, nondescript subdivisions.
[00:03:21 -> 00:03:29]  Recent population growth, modern building techniques, and standardized materials have led to a homogenized landscape lacking personality.
[00:03:29 -> 00:03:32]  Our gardens need to be the opposite of that.
[00:03:32 -> 00:03:36]  The location of my new home in an old town near the mountains in a river valley,
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:42]  it already exudes a sense of place so it's not hard for me to work with it, to highlight what's already here.
[00:03:42 -> 00:03:47]  But even if you live in a cut-and-paste suburb or even amongst a row of tract homes,
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:55]  your garden is your best opportunity to create a jewel-encrusted box that is your own and that declares you have arrived somewhere.
[00:03:56 -> 00:04:00]  I chose this spot as the hub for the garden because of its court-like appearance.
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:05]  I wanted it to have an old-world feel and the presence of the stone wall was perfect.
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:09]  Walls and fences help us subdivide a garden into garden rooms.
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:12]  A cottage garden, by design, needs a more enclosed feel.
[00:04:12 -> 00:04:22]  So if your house is out in the open grass, then you really want to add some fences or hedges or even a wall to partition your space into manageable chunks.
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:26]  This will help you make the space feel full with denser planting.
[00:04:26 -> 00:04:31]  I was lucky enough to have a ready-made, semi-enclosed space ready for use.
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:35]  Sun exposure was also a crucial consideration.
[00:04:36 -> 00:04:42]  My last place had a less-than-ideal sun exposure, being located on the north-facing side of a river valley.
[00:04:42 -> 00:04:47]  After years struggling to eke out some vegetables from the sunniest spots in that garden,
[00:04:47 -> 00:04:56]  I made sure to look out for a property that sat on a southern-facing slope, which guarantees maximum solar exposure for us in the northern hemisphere.
[00:04:56 -> 00:05:00]  This will be your greatest limiting factor when growing flowers and vegetables.
[00:05:00 -> 00:05:08]  While you can create beautiful shade gardens, you really want at least 4 to 8 hours, ideally, of full sun for productive and colorful gardens.
[00:05:08 -> 00:05:14]  A quick way to find out the sunniest spots in your garden is to observe how snow melts in winter.
[00:05:14 -> 00:05:18]  The places where it melts first are the best spots to plant flowers and vegetables.
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:21]  The last places to melt should be left alone.
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:23]  They are not good for most gardens.
[00:05:23 -> 00:05:32]  If it never snows where you are, it probably means that the angle of the sun is high enough that finding a sunny spot will never be an issue for you.
[00:05:32 -> 00:05:37]  This courtyard space does face south, but the house shades half of it in the afternoon.
[00:05:37 -> 00:05:45]  This means I can plant greens that love partial shade near the house and leave the space next to the stone wall to grow sun-loving things.
[00:05:45 -> 00:05:48]  For this reason, I place my protected beds in the middle.
[00:05:48 -> 00:05:54]  They would be perfect for growing greens and some other veggies that appreciate a little bit of afternoon shade.
[00:05:54 -> 00:06:01]  To provide easy access around the beds and to give the space a pleasant proportion, I allow the paths to be at least 3 feet wide.
[00:06:01 -> 00:06:05]  This would also make it easier to mow the grass with a standard mower.
[00:06:06 -> 00:06:11]  As a rule of thumb, raised beds should be 4 feet wide by 8 to 10 feet long.
[00:06:11 -> 00:06:19]  This allows for easy access into the center of the bed without actually having to step on it because we can comfortably reach in with our arms about 2 feet in.
[00:06:19 -> 00:06:23]  Beds that are against walls or fences can be 3 feet wide as a compromise.
[00:06:23 -> 00:06:28]  You can make them narrower, but they will dry up faster and eat up into your usable space.
[00:06:28 -> 00:06:37]  While I could have fit in this area 2 to 3 rows of rectangular beds, I wanted tall protected beds with removable panels to protect against potential deer.
[00:06:37 -> 00:06:41]  To make construction and use simpler, I settle on the square design.
[00:06:42 -> 00:06:47]  I did break the 4 foot wide rule making them a bit under 5 feet by 5 feet.
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:52]  Since they are square and accessible from all sides, I knew I wouldn't have a problem reaching the center.
[00:06:52 -> 00:06:55]  I also planned on using the cheap 6 foot fence boards.
[00:06:55 -> 00:07:01]  While using pressure treated wood is not ideal, it was the only material that fit into my budget.
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:09]  Cedar just wasn't feasible for me, and the new generation of pressure treated wood just doesn't contain the toxic arsenic of old boards.
[00:07:10 -> 00:07:19]  I did not want my enclosures to look like ugly cages like last time, so I devised roof lines with baroque curves to look more like fancy antique bird cages.
[00:07:20 -> 00:07:25]  I'm very pleased with the way the design turned out. It actually exceeded my expectations.
[00:07:25 -> 00:07:30]  The bottom part made the proportions right by balancing the visual weight.
[00:07:30 -> 00:07:36]  With the garden beds laid out, I turned my attention to the main path linking the back of the house to the front of the house.
[00:07:37 -> 00:07:43]  One of the areas I look most forward to having completed this corner, I want to round it out with the path.
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:50]  I do like the formal geometric shapes of the beds. They create pattern and rhythm.
[00:07:50 -> 00:07:55]  But it's also good to have a sweep, an arabesque.
[00:07:55 -> 00:08:01]  The way the path is right now, it just makes no sense. It's like at a weird angle to the house.
[00:08:01 -> 00:08:05]  It's kind of close to the house. It's all irregular and bad.
[00:08:05 -> 00:08:15]  So if I'm going to have an irregular and bad path, it might as well look beautiful and be much more of a garden path than a landscaper's path.
[00:08:16 -> 00:08:19]  I like to reuse and recycle materials as much as possible.
[00:08:19 -> 00:08:24]  This is not only economical, it also reduces our impact on landfills and the environment.
[00:08:24 -> 00:08:32]  When creating a cottage garden, it is best to use homely materials like gravel, stone, or brick to build out hardscape structures like paths.
[00:08:32 -> 00:08:39]  The trick to break these bigger blocks is to leverage them a bit with a shovel or iron rod, leaving an air gap beneath them.
[00:08:39 -> 00:08:46]  That way when you hit them with a sledgehammer, it shatters after a few blows into irregular and more manageable shapes.
[00:08:46 -> 00:08:50]  Concrete is generally the last thing you want in a cottage garden.
[00:08:50 -> 00:08:57]  However, you'd be surprised how broken up old concrete paths and patios can suddenly take on a stone-like character.
[00:08:57 -> 00:09:03]  Non-reinforced concrete paths break into irregular shapes that somewhat mimic stone.
[00:09:03 -> 00:09:10]  This material even has a name in the industry, it's called urbanite, since you find it everywhere in urban construction zones.
[00:09:10 -> 00:09:13]  It's usually just trash or fill-in material.
[00:09:13 -> 00:09:17]  Whoever installed this path here did not do a great job laying it out.
[00:09:17 -> 00:09:21]  It was all broken and out of level anyway, so I felt free to experiment.
[00:09:21 -> 00:09:26]  I could always remove it in the future and relay a path with more appropriate materials.
[00:09:26 -> 00:09:32]  I was only spending my time and some elbow grease to reshape the space into a more pleasing configuration.
[00:09:33 -> 00:09:35]  I redrew the path as a curve.
[00:09:35 -> 00:09:42]  This would enlarge the planting space next to the foundation of the house and would create a more harmonious and inviting curve to travel on.
[00:09:42 -> 00:09:48]  By installing the new path a bit below grade, I would also create a channel to steer water away from the house.
[00:09:50 -> 00:09:55]  I relayed them directly onto soil, transferring some of the good topsoil to my raised beds.
[00:09:55 -> 00:10:02]  The correct way of doing this would be to lay a bed of sand underneath them, so they don't settle too much in the future.
[00:10:02 -> 00:10:09]  But I planned on making a more irregular path with creeping plants planted in the crevices, more of a mix between a rock garden and a path.
[00:10:09 -> 00:10:17]  Since most of the day-to-day traffic on the property happens from the back door to the parking lot, this path would only be used for leisurely strolls to the garden.
[00:10:17 -> 00:10:24]  So I didn't feel it needed to be the most practical surface, and I would certainly be readjusting it for years to come anyways.
[00:10:25 -> 00:10:27]  I really like how this path is turning out.
[00:10:27 -> 00:10:33]  It has the old world feel that I am looking for, and once it's planted out, it's going to look great.
[00:10:33 -> 00:10:37]  I still have a section to do, and I'm not doing everything in one day, obviously.
[00:10:37 -> 00:10:41]  I'm staggering the workload so that it's more manageable to do.
[00:10:41 -> 00:10:52]  And once it's done, it's going to really transform this area and make this vegetable garden feel more like a French, old world potager.
[00:10:54 -> 00:11:00]  I was really pleased with the results, so I decided to start planting succulents in the cracks to prevent other weeds from taking over.
[00:11:01 -> 00:11:07]  I saw this tray of sedums in the store, and they're really like succulents for your garden.
[00:11:07 -> 00:11:13]  Succulents are all the rage now with millennials, so why not just have them in your ground so you can step on them?
[00:11:14 -> 00:11:24]  It makes sense to use them amongst the stepping stones here of this path, because, well, they should grow really well in such tight spots.
[00:11:25 -> 00:11:34]  And it's a way also of having something else, because if I don't plant anything, then the weeds are going to take over anyways, and grass is going to grow.
[00:11:34 -> 00:11:40]  I'll try this, and maybe some herbs that also like to be near or around rocks.
[00:11:43 -> 00:11:48]  In time, I would like to add other hardscape features to this side of the garden to complete the space.
[00:11:49 -> 00:11:54]  Right now I have the bare bones in place, but some other elements would complete the picture in the future.
[00:11:54 -> 00:12:00]  I still want to put up a fence in the front of the garden to better secure the unprotected beds from the marauding groundhog.
[00:12:00 -> 00:12:07]  Perhaps a short picket fence for a decorative wire one could help enclose the space and still stay true to this style.
[00:12:07 -> 00:12:11]  If you have any suggestions of what else I could put, write a comment down below.
[00:12:11 -> 00:12:18]  I would also want to replace the rotting shed in the back with a more interesting potting shed with some architectural features perhaps.
[00:12:18 -> 00:12:28]  The area right in front of it could be even a garden patio, and if I ever had the budget, a new French door coming out of the kitchen to the garden would make the space sing in functionality and beauty.
[00:12:28 -> 00:12:31]  It would be a perfect spot for garden tables and chairs.
[00:12:31 -> 00:12:34]  But this would have to stay on the wishlist for now.
[00:12:35 -> 00:12:39]  So far, I've shown you practical ways I've created structure while designing my own garden.
[00:12:40 -> 00:12:44]  But I would like to also share with you the actual theory behind these design choices.
[00:12:44 -> 00:12:48]  It is in the study of art that we find the secrets to creating pleasing spaces.
[00:12:53 -> 00:13:00]  Because I'm an artist, as I'm planning my garden, I'm constantly thinking of the elements of design that contribute to a good composition.
[00:13:00 -> 00:13:03]  They work the same way in a painting as they do in a garden.
[00:13:03 -> 00:13:05]  Let me quickly summarize them for you.
[00:13:05 -> 00:13:09]  Line is the fundamental element that organizes movement and mood.
[00:13:09 -> 00:13:15]  How we travel through a space creates a line, and we can use line to focus our vision onto something.
[00:13:15 -> 00:13:18]  Curved lines are natural, leisurely, gentle.
[00:13:18 -> 00:13:23]  Straight lines are formal and stable, while the jagged lines are nervous, tense, or active.
[00:13:23 -> 00:13:26]  Shapes can act in the same way as lines.
[00:13:26 -> 00:13:31]  The line and shape language we choose to organize our gardens with controls how we interact with the space.
[00:13:31 -> 00:13:37]  Rhythm is another important element that's created by repeating patterns of lines and shapes.
[00:13:37 -> 00:13:46]  A uniform rhythm can be stable and pleasing, but generally should be broken by unexpected syncopations to add interest and avoid stiff, lifeless monotony.
[00:13:46 -> 00:13:52]  On the other hand, a composition without a recognizable rhythm is often chaotic and disjointed.
[00:13:53 -> 00:14:01]  Many times this happens when a garden has too many disparate elements and odd shapes without a unifying, repeating element to organize them.
[00:14:01 -> 00:14:07]  Like a garden that's just full of kitschy ornaments. I'm sure you've seen them around.
[00:14:07 -> 00:14:14]  Well, while there's nothing wrong with having a garden like that, they usually lack a focal point, and that's another element of design.
[00:14:14 -> 00:14:21]  To create a focal point, we need to establish hierarchies and use the power of line and rhythm to direct the eye towards the focal point.
[00:14:21 -> 00:14:27]  Traditionally, tree-lined paths, called alleys, have been used to frame out focal points in the distance.
[00:14:27 -> 00:14:31]  Generally, focal points are created by difference in complexity.
[00:14:31 -> 00:14:37]  It can be a statue, a group of colorful plants, a house, an unusual tree, etc.
[00:14:37 -> 00:14:39]  Balance and symmetry are the next elements.
[00:14:39 -> 00:14:43]  They organize the other elements to create order and harmony.
[00:14:43 -> 00:14:48]  A symmetrical composition is usually balanced and pleasing, but can also be too stiff.
[00:14:48 -> 00:14:54]  An asymmetrical but still visually balanced composition is often more dynamic and naturalistic.
[00:14:54 -> 00:15:01]  Finally, value, color, and texture are the last element that can contribute to balance symmetry, rhythm, and focal point.
[00:15:01 -> 00:15:07]  A small, bright, active, colorful cluster can balance out larger, heavier, duller masses.
[00:15:07 -> 00:15:13]  Repeating value, color, or texture likewise can create organizing rhythm and also establish focal points.
[00:15:13 -> 00:15:19]  By studying these elements of design, we can create better compositions and understand why they work.
[00:15:21 -> 00:15:27]  With the more large-scale garden structures in place, I could now turn my attention to creating small-scale supports for plants.
[00:15:28 -> 00:15:33]  If you organize the big picture first, small-scale structures will fall in place.
[00:15:34 -> 00:15:37]  I'm doing a few more of the rustic towers.
[00:15:37 -> 00:15:43]  I do have a lot of twigs around, and I'll use copper wire to hold things together.
[00:15:44 -> 00:15:48]  That should make it much easier to assemble.
[00:15:51 -> 00:15:56]  In my past garden, I created more formal garden tutors out of deck spindles and fence boards.
[00:15:56 -> 00:16:02]  They were really successful designs, but in this garden, I wanted to create less formal, more natural structures to support the vining plants.
[00:16:02 -> 00:16:09]  My protected beds already had the formal design to them, so I could complement them with small-scale plant towers made of twigs.
[00:16:09 -> 00:16:14]  I have plenty of twigs for free in my property, so it made sense for me to use a free resource.
[00:16:14 -> 00:16:19]  They would also match the more informal and wild cottage garden aesthetic I wanted to evoke here.
[00:16:19 -> 00:16:27]  While I have previously shown how to weave a plant tower with sticks and bark, I felt that this more intuitive pattern was easier and faster to build.
[00:16:28 -> 00:16:32]  I've done all the cross bracings going this way, diagonally swirling up.
[00:16:32 -> 00:16:37]  Now I'm going to do the reverse, and that's going to give a structure.
[00:16:37 -> 00:16:41]  Hopefully, I won't even need rings to reinforce it.
[00:16:41 -> 00:16:46]  It's all going to be this more natural, rustic swirl that happens.
[00:16:46 -> 00:16:50]  It's a bit of a pattern that you see in nature anyways.
[00:16:50 -> 00:16:58]  Tying twigs with pieces of electrical copper wire is also a very practical way of building these makeshift Dr. Seuss-like structures.
[00:16:58 -> 00:17:04]  They are also reusable, so that when the twigs start to rot from one season to the next, as they inevitably do,
[00:17:04 -> 00:17:10]  I would disassemble the towers and rebuild them with new twigs, reusing the copper wires.
[00:17:11 -> 00:17:21]  To dress up the towers and add whimsy, I created finials on the top by bundling up weedy vines I had cleared from my peach trees.
[00:17:21 -> 00:17:24]  These were another resource masquerading as trash.
[00:17:24 -> 00:17:29]  All we need to transmute them into something magical is a bit of creativity and elbow grease.
[00:17:30 -> 00:17:37]  With these structures now in place, I could focus on the plants I wanted to introduce to make this space into a garden.
[00:17:40 -> 00:17:46]  Here's a sneak peek of how the garden has been transforming since I started with nothing but lawn.
[00:17:50 -> 00:17:55]  In an upcoming episode, we'll delve into the plant side of creating a cottage garden.
[00:17:55 -> 00:18:01]  How to choose the right plants, how to grow them, where to place them, how to pick harmonious color schemes and compositions,
[00:18:01 -> 00:18:03]  and the problems that may arise.
