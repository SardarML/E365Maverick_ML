[00:00:00 -> 00:00:08]  Hello and welcome. My name's Michelle. I'm going to take you through some basic first
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:14]  aid videos on behalf of Get Licensed. So my background is based primarily in leisure.
[00:00:14 -> 00:00:21]  I have been a first aider for about 20 years and I have been a life guide trainer, assessor
[00:00:21 -> 00:00:26]  and first aid trainer and assessor for about 10 years. I've had lots of experience dealing
[00:00:26 -> 00:00:33]  with first aids, lots of different spinal injuries, bleeds, breaks, pretty much anything
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:38]  you can imagine I've come across and I'm hoping that I'm going to be able to help you feel
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:42]  more confident about dealing with any of those types of things if you ever come across them.
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:46]  So throughout these basic first aid videos, I'm going to be taking you through the syllabus
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:50]  of an emergency first aid at work course, plus a few more advanced topics from first
[00:00:50 -> 00:00:54]  aid at work as well. So the sort of subjects we're going to be covering is your primary
[00:00:54 -> 00:01:02]  survey, CPR, choking, epilepsy, burns, amongst a few others as well. I hope you enjoy them.
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:13]  So what is first aid? First aid is the initial assistance that is given to somebody that
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:20]  is injured or has become unwell until further medical assistance arrives. So if that is
[00:01:20 -> 00:01:25]  you, you need to make sure that first and foremost that you are not in any danger.
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:29]  You are the most important person and make sure that there's no further danger to the
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:33]  casualty as well. There's some priorities of first aid that I'm going to talk you through.
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:38]  The first one is preserve life. So ultimately that is what we're trying to achieve. So we
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:44]  don't want anyone to die. So if we're going to get an AED and use that, do CPR, obviously
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:48]  that's all going to help preserve life as well as calling the ambulance. The second
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:54]  one is to alleviate any suffering. So anything we can do to do that, then maybe just lying
[00:01:54 -> 00:02:01]  somebody down, sitting them down, just comforting them, maybe applying an ice pack or cold
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:05]  water if they've burned themselves, anything like that that can alleviate suffering. The
[00:02:05 -> 00:02:10]  next one is to prevent it from getting any worse. So that might be by applying direct
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:15]  pressure to an open wound. It might be, again, sitting them down or lying them down and raising
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:20]  their legs before they fall down if they're feeling faint or anything like that. And the
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:25]  last one is to promote recovery. So to promote recovery, that might be getting them a drink.
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:30]  If they are low on blood sugar levels, it might be getting them to the hospital as quickly
[00:02:30 -> 00:02:37]  as possible. Okay, so there are your priorities of first aid. Preserve life, alleviate suffering,
[00:02:37 -> 00:02:40]  prevent the situation from getting any worse and promote recovery.
[00:02:45 -> 00:02:49]  So let's have a little look at what you'll find in a first aid kit. There is a minimum
[00:02:49 -> 00:02:55]  recommendation of what to have in here. So you'll find a guidance leaflet. You'll find
[00:02:55 -> 00:03:01]  some plasters. You should have some gloves in there, which is very important for your
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:04]  hygiene. You should always wear gloves when doing any type of first aid, even if there's
[00:03:04 -> 00:03:09]  not any visual bodily fluid, you should have them on just in case. You've also got triangular
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:15]  bandages, which can be used for quite a few things actually, but slings is one of
[00:03:15 -> 00:03:20]  the main ones. You may have some ice packs, but usually that is an additional requirement
[00:03:20 -> 00:03:29]  that is added in after looking at a risk assessment. Also scissors might be an added requirement.
[00:03:29 -> 00:03:36]  And you have different shaped and size bandages, so medium, large, small. You also have some
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:42]  eye bandages in case anyone has an eye injury. And you may have some adhesive tape as well
[00:03:42 -> 00:03:47]  to help apply any dressings. Okay, so this is some of what you'll find in your first
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:52]  aid kit. If you do find yourself having to do any type of first aid, like I said, hygiene
[00:03:52 -> 00:03:56]  is really important. So wearing your gloves, but also washing your hands beforehand and
[00:03:56 -> 00:04:01]  also afterwards. Thinking about any cuts that you may have on your hands or up your arm,
[00:04:01 -> 00:04:05]  making sure that they are fully covered. Also if you have a cold or anything like that,
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:10]  if you're coughing or sneezing a lot, perhaps try and get somebody else to do that first
[00:04:10 -> 00:04:16]  aid for that day. Or just make sure you don't cough or sneeze over an open wound. And just
[00:04:16 -> 00:04:25]  keep yourself and the casualty safe. Okay, so I'm going to take you through your
[00:04:25 -> 00:04:30]  primary survey now, which is basically looking for anything life-threatening and dealing
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:35]  with that with your casualty. So throughout your primary survey, we're going to look at
[00:04:35 -> 00:04:40]  an acronym called Doctor's ABC, which hopefully will help you remember this a little bit easier.
[00:04:40 -> 00:04:44]  So D is checking for danger. So first and foremost, any danger for yourself. You are
[00:04:44 -> 00:04:49]  the most important person, so we don't want you to get injured. Plus if you get injured,
[00:04:49 -> 00:04:53]  then you obviously can't help the person that needed your help to begin with. So have a
[00:04:53 -> 00:04:56]  look around for anything that could injure you, just general objects that could get in
[00:04:56 -> 00:05:01]  your way whilst dealing with the casualty. Any gas glass, fire wire, anything more serious,
[00:05:01 -> 00:05:04]  remove them and only when it's safe to do so, approach your casualty.
[00:05:04 -> 00:05:10]  Okay, so we've removed any dangers. We now want to check for response. So you've got
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:16]  your doctor, we're on your R, so response. Is there any response from your casualty?
[00:05:16 -> 00:05:21]  Are they alert? Do they respond to any voice prompts if they're not alert? So hello, can
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:25]  you hear me? Can you open your eyes? Anything like that. If they don't respond to that,
[00:05:25 -> 00:05:30]  do they respond to a tap on the shoulders? If they don't respond to that, then we would
[00:05:30 -> 00:05:35]  deem them unresponsive. If you are on your own at this point, you're not going to want
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:40]  to deal with that on your own, so just shout for help, okay? And then move on to checking
[00:05:40 -> 00:05:47]  the airway, okay? So that's doctor's A. So airway, and what we mean by airway is opening
[00:05:47 -> 00:05:50]  the airway. So we're going to use a head tilt chin lift, which I'm going to show you on
[00:05:50 -> 00:05:55]  somebody in a moment, okay? And by doing that, could actually save a life already. Where
[00:05:55 -> 00:05:59]  the muscles will relax when somebody's laying on their back, the tongue will relax on the
[00:05:59 -> 00:06:03]  potentially on the back of their throat and could block the airway. So just by doing
[00:06:03 -> 00:06:07]  a head tilt chin lift, we could have already saved their life. Once we've done a head tilt
[00:06:07 -> 00:06:11]  chin lift, so we've opened the airway, we're then going to check for breathing, okay? And
[00:06:11 -> 00:06:15]  we're going to do that for 10 seconds. We're going to be looking at the chest, rising and
[00:06:15 -> 00:06:20]  falling, and we're going to be listening and feeling for breath on our cheek as well. So
[00:06:20 -> 00:06:25]  we're going to get nice and close to the casualty. If we find that they are breathing normally,
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:30]  then we will have a look for any obvious signs of any injuries and deal with those,
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:33]  and then place them into what we call the recovery position, which is to maintain an
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:36]  open airway, which I'm now going to show you.
[00:06:41 -> 00:06:47]  So I'm going to show you practically now how to do your primary survey, okay? So I've checked
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:51]  for danger. There's nothing around that looks like it's going to cause me or my casualty
[00:06:51 -> 00:06:55]  any harm. So now I'm going to check for response. I'm going to talk into both ears just in case
[00:06:55 -> 00:07:01]  there's any hearing impairment at all in one of the ears. Hello, can you hear me?
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:10]  Can you open your eyes? If that doesn't work, a little tap or shake on the shoulder, okay?
[00:07:10 -> 00:07:13]  There's no response. So like I said earlier, if you're on your own at this point, shout
[00:07:13 -> 00:07:18]  for some help. Can I have some help? Now we're going to open the airway using a head tilt
[00:07:18 -> 00:07:22]  chin lift. So one hand on the forehead, two fingers underneath the chin, lift and lift
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:27]  the chin and tilt the head back. So I've opened the airway. I'm now going to check
[00:07:27 -> 00:07:35]  for breathing. So I'm looking for the rise and fall of the chest and I'm listening for
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:43]  breathing and I'm feeling for the breath on my cheek as well. So he is breathing normally.
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:49]  So if I have any help at this point, I'm going to ask them to just stand by and I will shortly
[00:07:49 -> 00:07:55]  be asking for a first aid kit and an ambulance as well if he hasn't come to. So I'm going
[00:07:55 -> 00:07:59]  to place him in a recovery position now. So I mentioned this earlier and this is just
[00:07:59 -> 00:08:04]  a safe position to maintain an open airway. If I leave him on his back, the tongue might
[00:08:04 -> 00:08:08]  relax on the back of the throat, which could cause him to not be able to breathe. Also,
[00:08:08 -> 00:08:14]  he could be sick and he could choke on the vomit. Okay. So first of all, for your recovery
[00:08:14 -> 00:08:17]  position, what we're going to do is place the arm closest to us up out of the way and
[00:08:17 -> 00:08:21]  just wherever that falls naturally. Don't try and force it down, just as though it's
[00:08:21 -> 00:08:25]  out the way. So I'm going to bring him towards me in a moment. I don't want him to squash
[00:08:25 -> 00:08:30]  his arm. I'm going to lean over and grab the forearm and I'm going to link fingers with
[00:08:30 -> 00:08:35]  the casualty and I'm going to place his hand against his cheek and I'm going to continue
[00:08:35 -> 00:08:40]  to hold the hand there. You might have to shuffle down a little bit because what you're
[00:08:40 -> 00:08:44]  going to do now is grab the outside of the leg that's furthest away from you and you're
[00:08:44 -> 00:08:48]  going to lift that as high as you possibly can so the foot is as close to the bottom
[00:08:48 -> 00:08:53]  as possible. That is now your lever. So any size casualty should be able to turn any size
[00:08:53 -> 00:08:59]  casualty. Okay. So I'm going to push down quite firm to bring the casualty over and
[00:08:59 -> 00:09:05]  just take that foot off of his leg there and then I'm going to slowly just take my hand
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:10]  away and most importantly, I'm going to make sure the airway is open. Okay. So if he's
[00:09:10 -> 00:09:14]  like this, the airway is shut. So all I'm doing is just lifting the chin up slightly
[00:09:14 -> 00:09:18]  to make sure the airway is open. A couple of other things to think about before you
[00:09:18 -> 00:09:23]  turn your casualty is do they have anything in their pockets? If they do, consider turning
[00:09:23 -> 00:09:28]  them to the side that they don't have anything in or maybe take it out, but just be careful
[00:09:28 -> 00:09:32]  and place that by the casualty's head. Also, if your casualty is wearing glasses, you may
[00:09:32 -> 00:09:35]  want to take those off because they might be uncomfortable for them, but again, just
[00:09:35 -> 00:09:39]  make sure they're by the casualty's head so if they do start to come to, we can quickly
[00:09:39 -> 00:09:44]  get them back on for them. Also, if you have a lady that's quite heavily pregnant,
[00:09:44 -> 00:09:50]  then lay them towards the left side. That is safer for the lady and the baby. Okay.
[00:09:50 -> 00:09:57]  So I'm now going to ask my helper to go and call 999 because I have a adult casualty that
[00:09:57 -> 00:10:07]  is breathing normally, but is unresponsive and has been for a good couple of minutes.
[00:10:07 -> 00:10:11]  So we've looked at our primary survey, assessing for anything life-threatening. I'm just going
[00:10:11 -> 00:10:14]  to talk a little bit about a secondary survey. So that's something that you might do for
[00:10:14 -> 00:10:20]  a conscious casualty or it could be an unconscious casualty as well. So your secondary survey
[00:10:20 -> 00:10:25]  consists of looking at your history, signs and symptoms. So the history might be the
[00:10:25 -> 00:10:29]  history of the casualty, so perhaps any medical conditions that they've had that could link
[00:10:29 -> 00:10:35]  to why they're a casualty at the moment. It could be any medication that they're on or
[00:10:35 -> 00:10:39]  literally the history leading up to what's just happened. So any physical activity or
[00:10:39 -> 00:10:42]  an accident of some kind that they've just had. Then we're going to look at the signs.
[00:10:42 -> 00:10:47]  So what can you visually see? Can you see that the casualty is perhaps sweaty? Do they
[00:10:47 -> 00:10:53]  look pale, flushed in appearance? Do they have any cuts or any obvious deformity or
[00:10:53 -> 00:10:57]  broken bones? And that can all help piece together what you're dealing with. You've
[00:10:57 -> 00:11:01]  then got symptoms. So that's something that the casualty can tell you. So it's really
[00:11:01 -> 00:11:05]  important that you listen to your casualty if they're able to speak to you. So they may
[00:11:05 -> 00:11:11]  tell you that they feel sick, that they feel hot, they feel cold. Anything, any information
[00:11:11 -> 00:11:15]  they can give you can help determine how to treat them.
[00:11:15 -> 00:11:24]  For this video, I'm going to show you how to deal with an adult that is not breathing.
[00:11:24 -> 00:11:29]  Okay, so we're going to go back to our primary survey that we looked at earlier to start
[00:11:29 -> 00:11:34]  with. So check for danger, check for response. Hello, can you hear me? Can you open your
[00:11:34 -> 00:11:40]  eyes? There's no response. If you don't have any help at this point, then shout for some
[00:11:40 -> 00:11:47]  help. Open the airway, head tilt, chin lift, and check for breathing for 10 seconds. Look
[00:11:47 -> 00:11:53]  at the chest rise and fall in, and listen and feel in for breathing.
[00:11:53 -> 00:11:58]  What we're looking for here is for normal breathing. Okay, so anything other than normal
[00:11:58 -> 00:12:04]  breathing, we would start CPR. There's something called agonal gasps, which are kind of like
[00:12:04 -> 00:12:10]  the last breaths that may sound a little like this. Okay, that's not normal breathing. That's
[00:12:10 -> 00:12:14]  not what any of us are doing right now. So anything other than normal breathing or you're
[00:12:14 -> 00:12:21]  not sure, start CPR. Okay, so my casualty is not breathing. I'm going to ask my helpers
[00:12:21 -> 00:12:25]  to go and get an ambulance and get a defib as quickly as they can, and I'm going to start
[00:12:25 -> 00:12:31]  CPR. So we're just going to try and buy some time for them by pumping on the chest and
[00:12:31 -> 00:12:36]  doing the breaths if you feel confident to do so. There might be a reason why you might
[00:12:36 -> 00:12:39]  not want to do the breaths if there's any blood or sick or anything like that, and that's
[00:12:39 -> 00:12:45]  fine. Just wait until there's a pocket mask or just do continuous chest compressions.
[00:12:45 -> 00:12:48]  So I've checked for breathing. I've sent off for an ambulance and a defib. I'm now going
[00:12:48 -> 00:12:53]  to start CPR. So I'm going to place my hand right in the centre of the chest, right on
[00:12:53 -> 00:12:59]  the breastbone. So heel of my hand right in the centre. The other hand is going to
[00:12:59 -> 00:13:03]  come over and I'm going to link fingers, and I'm just going to try and put pressure right
[00:13:03 -> 00:13:08]  on the breastbone, not on any of this part of the chest. A couple of pointers to make
[00:13:08 -> 00:13:14]  the compressions a little bit easier for yourself, but also the most effective for your casualty.
[00:13:14 -> 00:13:19]  Make sure that you place yourself as close to your casualty as possible. When you're
[00:13:19 -> 00:13:23]  placing your hand, make sure it is the heel of your hand right in the centre of the chest,
[00:13:23 -> 00:13:27]  a couple of centimetres above the bottom of the breastbone. Other hand's going to come
[00:13:27 -> 00:13:32]  over and link fingers. You're going to bring your shoulders in line with the rest of your
[00:13:32 -> 00:13:38]  arm, okay, so you're above your casualty. Lock your elbows and then just come straight
[00:13:38 -> 00:13:43]  down on the chest. Make sure you fully release on the chest when you're doing your compressions,
[00:13:43 -> 00:13:47]  but don't come off the chest. We don't want to be bouncing. So I'm going to push down
[00:13:47 -> 00:14:12]  five to six centimetres. So that's 30 compressions, and that's at a rate of about two per second,
[00:14:12 -> 00:14:18]  so between 100 to 120 per minute. After those 30 compressions, without delay, we
[00:14:18 -> 00:14:22]  need to do some breaths. So head tilt, chin lift again, but this time we need to pinch
[00:14:22 -> 00:14:26]  the nose to get a good seal because we're going to blow in the mouth. So put your mouth
[00:14:26 -> 00:14:34]  around there. Do one breath, come away, take a breath yourself, and then do a second breath.
[00:14:34 -> 00:14:39]  As you can see, the chest is rising. If you're not sure if the chest has rose or if you think
[00:14:39 -> 00:14:43]  it was unsuccessful, just try those two attempts and make sure you've got a good
[00:14:43 -> 00:14:48]  seal and a head tilt, chin lift is applied. Don't continue to keep putting those breaths
[00:14:48 -> 00:14:51]  in to make up for ones that are missed because you could be there all day if there's a blockage
[00:14:51 -> 00:15:14]  or something else wrong. After those two breaths, straight back into your 30 compressions.
[00:15:14 -> 00:15:24]  And then your two breaths. And you can continue to do that at a rate of 30 compressions to
[00:15:24 -> 00:15:30]  two breaths until your AED comes or the ambulance come. The only reason you would stop CPR is
[00:15:30 -> 00:15:33]  if you were really exhausted and there was no one else that could take over, you would
[00:15:33 -> 00:15:37]  have to stop. If the casualty was to come to, which obviously we would hope would be
[00:15:37 -> 00:15:45]  the case, or if the paramedics tell you to stop when they do arrive. Remember, check
[00:15:45 -> 00:15:50]  for danger, check for response, make sure you've got some help, open the airway, check
[00:15:50 -> 00:15:55]  for breathing. If they're not breathing, ask for an ambulance and a defib to come back
[00:15:55 -> 00:16:00]  to you as quickly as possible. And start CPR by doing 30 compressions at a depth of five
[00:16:00 -> 00:16:06]  to six centimetres and a rate of 100 to 120 per minute. And then your two rescue breaths
[00:16:06 -> 00:16:10]  followed by your 30 compressions to two rescue breaths and just continue that.
[00:16:10 -> 00:16:15]  Okay, so when you're doing CPR, there may be a couple of problems that might arise.
[00:16:15 -> 00:16:18]  So just so that you're prepared for them, I'll let you know. One of them is the possibility
[00:16:18 -> 00:16:23]  of breaking a rib. If you do break a rib, please try not to worry. It is at the bottom
[00:16:23 -> 00:16:28]  of our priorities. Breathing is first. Just make sure your hands are right in the centre
[00:16:28 -> 00:16:32]  of the chest and continue to do what you're doing at the correct depth. Don't change the
[00:16:32 -> 00:16:35]  depth of your compressions. Okay, another couple of things that might happen is the
[00:16:35 -> 00:16:40]  casualty might be sick. Don't worry about that. Just turn your casualty away from you,
[00:16:40 -> 00:16:45]  allow them to be sick, drain away, come back, check for breathing and then carry on CPR
[00:16:45 -> 00:16:46]  if they're still not breathing.
[00:16:51 -> 00:16:57]  Okay, so earlier I asked for an AED when I had a non-breathing casualty. An AED is
[00:16:57 -> 00:17:01]  an automated external defibrillator. It's a really clever piece of kit and it can increase
[00:17:01 -> 00:17:06]  the casualty's chance of survival anywhere up to around 75% if it's got to them within
[00:17:06 -> 00:17:10]  the first couple of minutes. So what this piece of kit will actually do is analyse the
[00:17:10 -> 00:17:15]  casualty's heart rhythm and determine whether there's a shockable rhythm. It will try and
[00:17:15 -> 00:17:20]  shock the heart in order to stop the heart to bring it back to its normal beat, normal
[00:17:20 -> 00:17:28]  rhythm. Okay, so I'm just going to open this up and let you see what's in here. It's a
[00:17:28 -> 00:17:33]  really safe piece of kit. It can't harm you, so nothing to worry about. So what you're
[00:17:33 -> 00:17:40]  going to find is potentially a pocket mask, towel, razor and scissors and the pads that
[00:17:40 -> 00:17:45]  we're going to apply onto the chest later, which I'll explain. So the scissors might
[00:17:45 -> 00:17:51]  be needed if we need to cut off any clothing. So the pads, I'll show you now, these ones,
[00:17:51 -> 00:17:58]  need to go directly onto bare skin. Okay, so we might need to cut clothing off. The
[00:17:58 -> 00:18:02]  razor is used if the chest is particularly hairy in the areas where we're going to place
[00:18:02 -> 00:18:08]  the pads. So we just need to have a quick shave of those areas to ensure the pads are
[00:18:08 -> 00:18:13]  going to stick properly. Pocket masks should be used any time when you're doing mouth-to-mouth,
[00:18:13 -> 00:18:17]  so as soon as you have one, use them and I'll open this up later on the casualty and show
[00:18:17 -> 00:18:22]  you. And the towel is going to be used if we need to dry the areas off, again, where
[00:18:22 -> 00:18:26]  the pads need to go, just so we can get good contact to the skin. If we don't have good
[00:18:26 -> 00:18:30]  contact to the skin, then when it does shock, it won't transfer through the heart as we
[00:18:30 -> 00:18:36]  need it to or it won't be as effective. Okay, so the defib that I'm showing you here is
[00:18:36 -> 00:18:41]  quite a lot smaller than the real defib, but it does act and explain things just as the
[00:18:41 -> 00:18:48]  real one would. Okay, so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to show you on a adult
[00:18:48 -> 00:18:54]  mannequin how to use the AED. Okay, so I'm going to show you how to use the AED now.
[00:18:54 -> 00:18:58]  So I've got my casualty that's not breathing, so I've done my primary survey, I've checked
[00:18:58 -> 00:19:01]  for danger, checked for response, I've opened the airway and checked for breathing, established
[00:19:01 -> 00:19:05]  that the casualty is not breathing normally, so I've asked for them to go and get an ambulance
[00:19:05 -> 00:19:10]  and bring an AED back for me as quickly as they can. Whilst they're off doing that, I'm
[00:19:10 -> 00:19:15]  going to buy the casualty some time by doing my 30 compressions to 2 breaths and continuing
[00:19:15 -> 00:19:21]  that cycle of 30 to 2. As soon as the AED comes back, I'm going to stop what I'm doing
[00:19:21 -> 00:19:26]  on the casualty and I'm going to open up the defib, okay, because this is going to give
[00:19:26 -> 00:19:32]  them the best chance of survival. So if there's anything to the chest that I need to prepare,
[00:19:32 -> 00:19:37]  so drying it off or taking off any clothes, so using the scissors or using the razor if
[00:19:37 -> 00:19:42]  the chest is particularly hairy, then I'm going to prep all of that. Make sure I turn
[00:19:42 -> 00:19:47]  the AED on and listen to the instructions.
[00:19:47 -> 00:19:54]  Apply pads to patient's bare chest. Plug in pads connector next to flashing light.
[00:19:55 -> 00:19:59]  So on the pads it does have pictures, diagrams of exactly where they need to go.
[00:19:59 -> 00:20:06]  Apply pads. Plug in connector.
[00:20:08 -> 00:20:10]  So just do that one at a time.
[00:20:10 -> 00:20:14]  Apply pads. Plug in connector.
[00:20:14 -> 00:20:18]  Analysing heart rhythm.
[00:20:18 -> 00:20:21]  Do not touch the patient.
[00:20:21 -> 00:20:24]  Everyone stand clear.
[00:20:24 -> 00:20:28]  Shock advised.
[00:20:28 -> 00:20:31]  Charging.
[00:20:31 -> 00:20:33]  Stay clear of patient.
[00:20:33 -> 00:20:35]  No one touch the patient.
[00:20:35 -> 00:20:40]  Deliver shock now. Shock delivered.
[00:20:40 -> 00:20:45]  Begin CPR.
[00:20:45 -> 00:20:50]  So as soon as the AED tells you to continue CPR, do so without delay.
[00:20:50 -> 00:20:55]  As you can hear, some of them have a metronome, so it instructs you when to beep, but you're
[00:20:55 -> 00:21:00]  still doing your 30 compressions to two rescue breaths.
[00:21:00 -> 00:21:05]  You'll continue to do that for around two minutes whilst the defib recharges and then
[00:21:05 -> 00:21:09]  analyses the heart rhythm again and lets you know whether it's going to shock or not.
[00:21:09 -> 00:21:12]  Then it will instruct you whether to continue CPR.
[00:21:12 -> 00:21:18]  The only reason you're going to stop is if the casualty shows definite signs of life
[00:21:18 -> 00:21:22]  or the paramedics ask you to or you're physically exhausted.
[00:21:22 -> 00:21:26]  Now obviously if you did have somebody else with you, you don't have to be trained to
[00:21:26 -> 00:21:30]  use an AED, although it does obviously give you a lot more confidence, but if you did
[00:21:30 -> 00:21:35]  have someone else, get them to do that whilst you continue to do compressions and breaths
[00:21:35 -> 00:21:41]  and they can work around you with the defib.
[00:21:41 -> 00:21:46]  If you have a casualty that's not breathing and obviously you need to do mouth-to-mouth,
[00:21:46 -> 00:21:51]  then using a pocket mask is the best thing to do mouth-to-mouth with.
[00:21:51 -> 00:21:56]  It just protects you if they are sick or if they have swallowed anything that's potentially
[00:21:56 -> 00:21:59]  poisonous that could get into your system.
[00:21:59 -> 00:22:02]  You're going to open it up. There is a little attachment that comes with it that I'm going
[00:22:02 -> 00:22:10]  to show you in a moment. You just need to push this bit out so it looks like this.
[00:22:10 -> 00:22:15]  There is the word nose here so it tells you exactly where you need to place it.
[00:22:16 -> 00:22:23]  It needs to come over the mouth and nose. Make a little diamond shape with your fingers
[00:22:23 -> 00:22:26]  and push down on the casualty's face.
[00:22:26 -> 00:22:31]  I'm then going to still apply a chin lift and tilt the head back.
[00:22:31 -> 00:22:35]  Then I should just be able to apply the same amount of pressure with regards to the breath
[00:22:35 -> 00:22:42]  when I'm doing the breaths.
[00:22:43 -> 00:22:47]  If you do have an attachment like I showed you earlier, I don't always have them because
[00:22:47 -> 00:22:52]  they are only one use, then do use it because that just gives you another filter so a little
[00:22:52 -> 00:22:58]  bit of added protection. Just pop that on and then use it normally like I've just shown you.
[00:23:03 -> 00:23:09]  If you do have a smaller child or a baby and you want to use a pocket mask, then you may
[00:23:09 -> 00:23:13]  want to consider just turning it upside down because their face is a lot smaller and it
[00:23:13 -> 00:23:19]  does fit on a little bit better that way. Otherwise for an adult, just like that.
[00:23:24 -> 00:23:29]  If you find yourself in an emergency situation where you have a casualty that is not breathing,
[00:23:29 -> 00:23:33]  there is something called the chain of survival which is absolutely key to giving somebody
[00:23:33 -> 00:23:36]  the best chance of survival in living.
[00:23:36 -> 00:23:41]  The chain of survival consists of four links. The first one is early recognition and call
[00:23:41 -> 00:23:47]  for help. If you find someone that's not breathing, we need to establish that they are not breathing
[00:23:47 -> 00:23:52]  and it's not normal breathing, recognise that and call for help. Call for an ambulance and
[00:23:52 -> 00:23:54]  get an AED as quickly as possible.
[00:23:54 -> 00:24:01]  The second link is early CPR. Apply in CPR your 30 compressions to two rescue breaths
[00:24:01 -> 00:24:05]  as quickly as possible and that will buy your casualty some time whilst the defib and the
[00:24:05 -> 00:24:06]  ambulance is on its way.
[00:24:06 -> 00:24:13]  The third link is early AED, so automated external defibrillator. As soon as that is available,
[00:24:13 -> 00:24:19]  get that applied to the casualty and use it as directed to do so by the AED unit.
[00:24:19 -> 00:24:24]  The AED unit can increase your chance of survival anywhere up to about 75% if it's got to them
[00:24:24 -> 00:24:30]  in the first minute or two of collapsing and that will decrease by about 10% every minute
[00:24:30 -> 00:24:32]  it's delayed after that time.
[00:24:32 -> 00:24:39]  The fourth link in the chain of survival is early post-resuscitation care. So basically
[00:24:39 -> 00:24:43]  making sure that they can get to hospital, get that medication and equipment, specialised
[00:24:43 -> 00:24:45]  medical equipment that they need as early as possible.
[00:24:50 -> 00:24:56]  So I'm going to show you how to deal with a child that is not breathing. Okay, so it's
[00:24:56 -> 00:25:00]  similar in respect to the primary survey that we've done for the adult casualty earlier
[00:25:01 -> 00:25:05]  but there are some differences in the process of CPR, mainly because the reason that they
[00:25:05 -> 00:25:09]  are potentially not breathing is more of a respiratory issue, whereas with an adult
[00:25:09 -> 00:25:13]  casualty it's more of a heart problem that we're dealing with.
[00:25:13 -> 00:25:16]  Okay, so you're going to check for danger. So again, first and foremost for yourself,
[00:25:16 -> 00:25:21]  but then also for your casualty and remove any danger or if you can't, then wait until
[00:25:21 -> 00:25:23]  someone can assist you.
[00:25:23 -> 00:25:26]  If there isn't any danger, then we're going to check for response.
[00:25:26 -> 00:25:29]  Hello, can you hear me? Can you open your eyes?
[00:25:29 -> 00:25:33]  Okay, there's no response. If you're on your own, then shout for some help.
[00:25:33 -> 00:25:39]  Open the airway, head tilt, chin lift, but just not as far back as you would on an adult
[00:25:39 -> 00:25:44]  casualty and then get nice and close to the face and check for breathing for 10 seconds.
[00:25:47 -> 00:25:51]  So we're looking for the chest rising and falling and we're listening and feeling for
[00:25:51 -> 00:25:53]  breath on our cheek.
[00:25:53 -> 00:25:56]  Okay, so the casualty is not breathing, so I'm going to ask somebody to go and get me
[00:25:56 -> 00:26:00]  an ambulance and a defib and come back as quickly as they can and I'm going to start CPR.
[00:26:00 -> 00:26:04]  So like I said, because this is a respiratory issue, we're going to start off with giving
[00:26:04 -> 00:26:06]  them some much needed rescue breaths.
[00:26:06 -> 00:26:11]  So, head tilt, chin lift, pinch the nose, get a nice seal and we're going to put five
[00:26:11 -> 00:26:13]  rescue breaths in the mouth.
[00:26:24 -> 00:26:30]  We're just going to use one hand, again, right in the centre of the chest on the breastbone
[00:26:30 -> 00:26:35]  and we're going to apply pressure at three to four centimetres, around a third of the
[00:26:35 -> 00:26:38]  chest depth and we're going to do that 30 times.
[00:26:54 -> 00:26:57]  Then we're going to do two rescue breaths.
[00:27:01 -> 00:27:04]  And then back to 30 compressions.
[00:27:07 -> 00:27:10]  So, five initial rescue breaths.
[00:27:10 -> 00:27:13]  If they don't come round after those five initial rescue breaths, we're going to very
[00:27:13 -> 00:27:18]  quickly go on to our 30 compressions, two rescue breaths and then continue that cycle
[00:27:18 -> 00:27:23]  of 30 to two until the defib comes and or the ambulance arrives.
[00:27:28 -> 00:27:31]  So, I'm going to show you how to deal with a baby that is not breathing now, which is
[00:27:31 -> 00:27:35]  probably one of the most scariest things people can think of when we're dealing with a first
[00:27:35 -> 00:27:36]  aid situation.
[00:27:36 -> 00:27:40]  Hopefully, I can put your mind at ease a little bit and just remember, if no one else knows
[00:27:40 -> 00:27:43]  what they're doing, anything that you can do is better than nothing in this type of
[00:27:43 -> 00:27:44]  situation.
[00:27:45 -> 00:27:47]  Okay, so we're going to check for danger.
[00:27:47 -> 00:27:49]  There isn't any danger, so I'm going to check for response.
[00:27:49 -> 00:27:51]  Check for response on the baby.
[00:27:51 -> 00:27:54]  You can still try and talk to them, see if they can respond to noise.
[00:27:54 -> 00:27:59]  Maybe clap close to their face, blow in their face, see if there's a reaction.
[00:28:00 -> 00:28:04]  A little squeeze, tiggle on the feet or hands.
[00:28:04 -> 00:28:07]  Okay, so there's no response, so again, if you're on your own, make sure you've got some
[00:28:07 -> 00:28:10]  help and I'm going to open the airway.
[00:28:11 -> 00:28:14]  When you're opening the airway for a baby, you need to be very careful and don't tilt
[00:28:14 -> 00:28:17]  the head all the way back, just in a neutral position.
[00:28:18 -> 00:28:21]  I'm going to check for breathing for 10 seconds.
[00:28:26 -> 00:28:29]  Okay, so the baby isn't breathing normally, so I'm going to ask for an ambulance and a
[00:28:29 -> 00:28:31]  defib and I'm going to start CPR.
[00:28:32 -> 00:28:36]  Again, with a baby, we suspect it's a respiratory issue, so we're going to start with five rescue
[00:28:36 -> 00:28:37]  breaths.
[00:28:37 -> 00:28:41]  Because the baby's features are so small, we're going to place our mouth over the mouth
[00:28:41 -> 00:28:43]  and the nose.
[00:28:45 -> 00:28:58]  When it comes to doing the 30 compressions, I'm going to use two fingers right in the
[00:28:58 -> 00:29:03]  centre of the chest and we're going to put a third of the chest up.
[00:29:15 -> 00:29:18]  After your 30 compressions, two rescue breaths.
[00:29:21 -> 00:29:23]  Then back to your 30 compressions.
[00:29:24 -> 00:29:29]  Okay, so for a baby that's not breathing, check for danger, check for response, make
[00:29:29 -> 00:29:34]  sure you've got some help, open your airway, check for breathing for 10 seconds and then
[00:29:34 -> 00:29:39]  start by giving five initial rescue breaths by placing your mouth over the mouth and the
[00:29:39 -> 00:29:40]  nose.
[00:29:40 -> 00:29:45]  And then do your 30 compressions with two fingers and then two rescue breaths.
[00:29:45 -> 00:29:47]  Back to 30 compressions and two rescue breaths.
[00:29:47 -> 00:29:50]  And keep doing that cycle until your defib arrives.
[00:29:55 -> 00:30:01]  Okay, so hopefully if a baby or a child has stopped breathing, you doing your initial
[00:30:01 -> 00:30:04]  five rescue breaths is going to help.
[00:30:04 -> 00:30:09]  If a baby or a child has stopped breathing, you doing your initial five rescue breaths
[00:30:09 -> 00:30:11]  along with CPR will hopefully bring them round.
[00:30:11 -> 00:30:15]  But in the event that they don't, we have asked for a defib, so when it comes to us
[00:30:15 -> 00:30:16]  we're going to apply the defib.
[00:30:16 -> 00:30:20]  But it is a little bit different than what we saw on the adult earlier.
[00:30:20 -> 00:30:26]  Okay, so you'd usually have paediatric pads with your defib or you may have the ability
[00:30:26 -> 00:30:31]  to be able to change the amount of joules that is going to go through the casualties,
[00:30:31 -> 00:30:33]  the amount of energy.
[00:30:34 -> 00:30:40]  For paediatric pads, that is for under the age of eight and obviously from eight and
[00:30:40 -> 00:30:43]  above we would use that for the adult pads.
[00:30:48 -> 00:30:52]  So you would do exactly the same as you did before, so turn the defib on and apply the
[00:30:52 -> 00:30:54]  pads as instructed to do so.
[00:30:55 -> 00:31:01]  But as you can see from here, we are going to place them in a slightly different area.
[00:31:02 -> 00:31:07]  So it tells us to put one on the back and again they can't have any clothes on, needs
[00:31:07 -> 00:31:08]  to be bare skin.
[00:31:08 -> 00:31:12]  So one in the centre of the back in between the shoulder blades.
[00:31:14 -> 00:31:18]  We're basically going to sandwich them in, so then one in the centre on the chest as
[00:31:18 -> 00:31:19]  well.
[00:31:20 -> 00:31:24]  Okay, and that will be exactly the same on the baby, so one on the front and one on the
[00:31:24 -> 00:31:25]  back.
[00:31:32 -> 00:31:35]  But obviously with no clothes on.
[00:31:45 -> 00:31:50]  Alright guys, I'm going to show you what to do if you suspect that somebody is choking.
[00:31:50 -> 00:31:52]  So we're going to look at an adult casualty to start with.
[00:31:53 -> 00:31:57]  So if you suspect someone is choking, perhaps you've seen the adult casualty and you've
[00:31:58 -> 00:32:02]  So if you suspect someone is choking, perhaps you've seen them eat something and then start
[00:32:02 -> 00:32:03]  to panic.
[00:32:04 -> 00:32:08]  Maybe they're clutching at their throat, maybe they're changing colour, maybe initially
[00:32:08 -> 00:32:12]  red to start with and then signs of cyanosis, so blueness of the lips.
[00:32:14 -> 00:32:16]  What we're going to do first if we suspect they're choking, we're going to ask, are you
[00:32:16 -> 00:32:17]  choking?
[00:32:18 -> 00:32:19]  Are you choking?
[00:32:20 -> 00:32:22]  He's nodded, he is choking.
[00:32:22 -> 00:32:25]  Okay, so the next thing we're going to do, if he is able to cough, we're just going to
[00:32:25 -> 00:32:26]  encourage coughing.
[00:32:27 -> 00:32:28]  So just keep coughing.
[00:32:28 -> 00:32:29]  That's it, keep coughing.
[00:32:29 -> 00:32:30]  Well done, keep coughing.
[00:32:31 -> 00:32:34]  So as soon as the coughing becomes ineffective, we're going to have to take physical action.
[00:32:34 -> 00:32:37]  So we're going to get our casualty to lean forward and we're going to support them across
[00:32:37 -> 00:32:41]  the chest and hold onto the shoulder and we're going to apply some back blows.
[00:32:41 -> 00:32:46]  So we're going to put the palm of our hand in the middle of their shoulder blades and
[00:32:46 -> 00:32:50]  we're going to do one back blow and we're going to come and check to see if they're
[00:32:50 -> 00:32:52]  managing to catch their breath or if an object has fallen out.
[00:32:52 -> 00:32:56]  If it hasn't, we're going to do a second back blow, check again.
[00:32:58 -> 00:33:00]  A third, if it's not successful, check again.
[00:33:01 -> 00:33:02]  Still hasn't worked.
[00:33:03 -> 00:33:04]  Fourth back blow, check again.
[00:33:06 -> 00:33:08]  And a fifth back blow, check again.
[00:33:09 -> 00:33:12]  Okay, if that hasn't worked, we're going to have to try something different.
[00:33:12 -> 00:33:14]  So we're going to try something called abdominal thrust.
[00:33:14 -> 00:33:16]  You may have heard it called the Heimlich Maneuver.
[00:33:17 -> 00:33:21]  So we're going to place our hand, you're going to find the belly button and the bottom
[00:33:21 -> 00:33:25]  of the breastbone on the casualty and make your way into the middle.
[00:33:26 -> 00:33:31]  Place a fist in that point and place your other hand over the top.
[00:33:32 -> 00:33:36]  And what we're going to do is push in and up in one action into the diaphragm and
[00:33:36 -> 00:33:39]  hopefully that will release the object.
[00:33:41 -> 00:33:42]  One, check.
[00:33:44 -> 00:33:45]  Two, check.
[00:33:47 -> 00:33:48]  Three, check.
[00:33:49 -> 00:33:50]  Four.
[00:33:50 -> 00:33:51]  Has it come out?
[00:33:51 -> 00:33:52]  No.
[00:33:52 -> 00:33:53]  Five.
[00:33:54 -> 00:33:58]  Okay, if it still hasn't come out at that point, we're going to class it as one cycle.
[00:33:58 -> 00:34:01]  So up to five back blows and five abdominal thrusts.
[00:34:02 -> 00:34:06]  So if after one cycle it hasn't come out, ask somebody to call an ambulance if they haven't already.
[00:34:06 -> 00:34:08]  And then we're going to continue that cycle.
[00:34:09 -> 00:34:12]  So we're going to do one, check.
[00:34:13 -> 00:34:14]  Two, check.
[00:34:15 -> 00:34:18]  Three, four, five, checking after each one.
[00:34:18 -> 00:34:21]  If that's not successful, back to your abdominal thrusts.
[00:34:21 -> 00:34:23]  Again, up to five, checking after each one.
[00:34:23 -> 00:34:25]  It's important that you do check.
[00:34:25 -> 00:34:27]  It may not be obvious it's come out straight away.
[00:34:27 -> 00:34:29]  They may be catching their breath and not be able to tell you.
[00:34:29 -> 00:34:33]  So the last thing they're going to want is more smacks on the back or abdominal thrusts
[00:34:33 -> 00:34:35]  because it can cause quite a bit of internal damage.
[00:34:35 -> 00:34:37]  So do make sure you're checking.
[00:34:37 -> 00:34:40]  Okay, so if the item does come out, then brilliant.
[00:34:40 -> 00:34:44]  But we're still going to get them to go to hospital to get checked out,
[00:34:44 -> 00:34:46]  just in case, as I say, they have done any internal damage.
[00:34:46 -> 00:34:50]  Or if the ambulance is on its way already, then they can check them out when they get here.
[00:34:50 -> 00:34:54]  If it doesn't come out, it won't be long until they do collapse.
[00:34:54 -> 00:34:59]  So if they do collapse to the floor, we are going to start doing CPR.
[00:34:59 -> 00:35:00]  So we don't need to check for breathing.
[00:35:00 -> 00:35:04]  We know they're not breathing because they've been choking and they've collapsed for that reason.
[00:35:04 -> 00:35:07]  So we're just going to go straight into 30 compressions to two rescue breaths.
[00:35:07 -> 00:35:09]  Checking the mouth before each rescue breath,
[00:35:09 -> 00:35:14]  just to see if there's any obvious signs of any food or whatever it is they may have choked on,
[00:35:14 -> 00:35:18]  which we can easily remove and then continue with our rescue breaths.
[00:35:22 -> 00:35:26]  Okay, so I'm going to show you how to deal with a child that is choking.
[00:35:26 -> 00:35:31]  If you suspect a child is choking, that might be due to the fact that they have just been eating
[00:35:31 -> 00:35:33]  and now they looked quite panicked.
[00:35:33 -> 00:35:35]  It may be that they're changing colour in the face,
[00:35:35 -> 00:35:41]  maybe initially going quite red and then losing colour and maybe going a little bit blue in the lips.
[00:35:41 -> 00:35:45]  All right, so what we're going to do is we're going to ask, are they choking?
[00:35:45 -> 00:35:47]  And just establish that they are choking,
[00:35:47 -> 00:35:53]  so we don't unnecessarily do a procedure that could hurt them for no reason.
[00:35:53 -> 00:35:55]  Okay, so are you choking?
[00:35:55 -> 00:35:58]  He tells me, he gives me the nod, he's choking.
[00:35:58 -> 00:36:03]  Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to lean him as far forward as I can,
[00:36:03 -> 00:36:05]  let gravity help as much as I can.
[00:36:05 -> 00:36:11]  Obviously, depending on the size of the child will allow you to do it a lot more if they're smaller.
[00:36:11 -> 00:36:14]  So, lean them over and we're going to do back blows.
[00:36:14 -> 00:36:19]  So, right in the middle of the shoulder blades, I'm going to use the heel of my hand.
[00:36:19 -> 00:36:33]  So, one, check, two, check, see if it's come out, three, four, check, five.
[00:36:33 -> 00:36:35]  So, I'm going to do that five times.
[00:36:35 -> 00:36:38]  Okay, it hasn't been successful, so I'm going to try something else now.
[00:36:38 -> 00:36:40]  I'm going to try abdominal thrust.
[00:36:40 -> 00:36:44]  So, I'm going to find the belly button and the bottom of the breastbone and meet in the middle,
[00:36:44 -> 00:36:47]  make a fist, I'm going to bring my other hand over the top
[00:36:47 -> 00:36:53]  and I'm going to come in and up into the diaphragm to hopefully release the object.
[00:36:54 -> 00:37:07]  So, one, check, two, three, check, four, still not successful, five, check.
[00:37:07 -> 00:37:09]  Okay, still not successful.
[00:37:09 -> 00:37:12]  So, we class that as one cycle.
[00:37:12 -> 00:37:16]  So, up to five back blows and up to five abdominal thrusts is one cycle.
[00:37:16 -> 00:37:20]  If it's not successful after that, send somebody to go and get an ambulance.
[00:37:20 -> 00:37:22]  And we're going to repeat that cycle again.
[00:37:22 -> 00:37:26]  So, up to five back blows, checking after each one.
[00:37:33 -> 00:37:37]  And then back to your abdominal thrust if that is unsuccessful.
[00:37:37 -> 00:37:39]  Okay, and just keep repeating that process.
[00:37:39 -> 00:37:44]  You're probably not going to be able to repeat it too many more times before the child does actually collapse.
[00:37:44 -> 00:37:49]  So, if they do collapse, what we're going to do is go straight into CPR.
[00:37:49 -> 00:37:54]  And unlike normal CPR, we're actually going to start with 30 compressions for the child
[00:37:54 -> 00:37:57]  just because we know at this point that the breaths aren't going to get in
[00:37:57 -> 00:37:59]  even though they do desperately need those breaths.
[00:37:59 -> 00:38:02]  So, we're going to do 30 compressions.
[00:38:04 -> 00:38:06]  After your 30 compressions,
[00:38:07 -> 00:38:09]  we're going to have a look in the mouth.
[00:38:09 -> 00:38:11]  See if there's anything that we can release.
[00:38:11 -> 00:38:16]  And then open the airway and do two rescue breaths.
[00:38:17 -> 00:38:20]  If one or both of them don't go in, don't worry.
[00:38:20 -> 00:38:23]  Go back to your 30 compressions and then try again next time.
[00:38:23 -> 00:38:25]  Hopefully, now the muscles are all relaxed.
[00:38:25 -> 00:38:27]  You're going to have a look in the mouth.
[00:38:27 -> 00:38:29]  See if there's anything that we can release.
[00:38:29 -> 00:38:33]  And then open the airway and do two rescue breaths.
[00:38:34 -> 00:38:36]  Hopefully, now the muscles are all relaxed.
[00:38:36 -> 00:38:38]  The object might have moved on its own
[00:38:38 -> 00:38:42]  or perhaps even by us doing the compressions, it has managed to move.
[00:38:42 -> 00:38:45]  So, we're going to continue to do that until our ambulance arrives
[00:38:45 -> 00:38:48]  and we need to make sure that we've also asked for a defib.
[00:38:52 -> 00:38:56]  So, like any choking situation, is time critical?
[00:38:56 -> 00:38:58]  If you've got a baby that you suspect is choking,
[00:38:58 -> 00:39:02]  what we need to do is get their head lower than the rest of their body as quickly as possible
[00:39:02 -> 00:39:04]  and hopefully gravity will help.
[00:39:04 -> 00:39:07]  If that doesn't help on its own, we're going to have to do some back blows.
[00:39:07 -> 00:39:11]  So, we're going to apply five back blows right in the centre,
[00:39:11 -> 00:39:14]  sorry, in between the shoulder blades.
[00:39:16 -> 00:39:17]  I'm going to check.
[00:39:17 -> 00:39:19]  Make sure you support the head and neck.
[00:39:19 -> 00:39:20]  Two.
[00:39:22 -> 00:39:23]  Three.
[00:39:24 -> 00:39:25]  Four.
[00:39:27 -> 00:39:28]  Five.
[00:39:28 -> 00:39:30]  Okay, if that hasn't worked,
[00:39:30 -> 00:39:32]  we're going to turn the baby over
[00:39:32 -> 00:39:36]  and again get the head as low as possible
[00:39:36 -> 00:39:38]  and we're going to do chest thrusts.
[00:39:38 -> 00:39:43]  So, we're going to put our fingers one level below the nipple line
[00:39:44 -> 00:39:47]  and we'll do one chest thrust, check the mouth.
[00:39:48 -> 00:39:49]  Two.
[00:39:49 -> 00:39:50]  Check the mouth.
[00:39:51 -> 00:39:52]  Three.
[00:39:52 -> 00:39:53]  Check again.
[00:39:53 -> 00:39:54]  Four.
[00:39:55 -> 00:39:56]  Five.
[00:39:56 -> 00:40:00]  If that's not been successful, that is one cycle.
[00:40:00 -> 00:40:04]  If someone hasn't already, make sure that they've called the ambulance and they've got a defib
[00:40:04 -> 00:40:07]  and we're going to turn the baby back over again
[00:40:07 -> 00:40:09]  and apply the back blows.
[00:40:09 -> 00:40:12]  Again, up to five, checking after each one.
[00:40:17 -> 00:40:20]  And then back to your chest thrusts,
[00:40:20 -> 00:40:22]  checking after each one.
[00:40:27 -> 00:40:28]  Okay.
[00:40:28 -> 00:40:30]  Now, hopefully that will work.
[00:40:30 -> 00:40:33]  If it doesn't, the baby stops breathing
[00:40:33 -> 00:40:35]  so they'll probably go very floppy,
[00:40:35 -> 00:40:37]  so all the arms and legs will flop
[00:40:37 -> 00:40:39]  and they would have lost colour in their face
[00:40:39 -> 00:40:41]  and maybe have blue tinges in their lips.
[00:40:41 -> 00:40:43]  We're going to place them on a hard surface
[00:40:44 -> 00:40:46]  and we're going to start CPR.
[00:40:46 -> 00:40:48]  We're going to start with 30 compressions
[00:40:48 -> 00:40:50]  just because there's no point in doing the breasts at this stage
[00:40:50 -> 00:40:53]  because we know it's not going to go in because they've got a blockage.
[00:40:53 -> 00:40:55]  So, 30 compressions.
[00:40:57 -> 00:40:58]  And we're going to bring the baby over.
[00:41:07 -> 00:41:10]  And just before I do the two rescue breaths,
[00:41:10 -> 00:41:11]  I'm going to have a little look in the mouth.
[00:41:11 -> 00:41:14]  If there's anything that's visible and easy to reach,
[00:41:14 -> 00:41:17]  I'm going to take that out and then do the two rescue breaths.
[00:41:20 -> 00:41:23]  If one or even both of them aren't successful,
[00:41:23 -> 00:41:25]  I don't attempt to do them again.
[00:41:25 -> 00:41:29]  Nid ydych chi'n ymwneud â'i wneud newydd, rydw i'n mynd i'r ffwrdd i'n ymgyrchau.
[00:41:29 -> 00:41:31]  A gobeithio, er bod y bod yn dechrau'n ysbrydoli,
[00:41:31 -> 00:41:33]  mae'r musglau yn ysbrydoli, bydd yr obiect yn mynd,
[00:41:33 -> 00:41:36]  neu efallai i mi wneud yr ymgyrchau, bydd yn mynd
[00:41:36 -> 00:41:38]  a bydd y brethyn yn ymgyrchu.
[00:41:38 -> 00:41:41]  Felly byddwn ni'n mynd i wneud hynny ar gyfer 30 o ymgyrchau i ddwy brethyn
[00:41:41 -> 00:41:43]  pan fydd ein ambulans a'r defib yn dod
[00:41:43 -> 00:41:46]  ac rydyn ni'n dweud y bydd yr ambulans yn mynd i ddod ymlaen.
[00:41:50 -> 00:41:53]  Rydyn ni'n edrych ar ddau ffordd o ymgyrchu ar y cwrs gweithio'r cyhoeddiad cyntaf.
[00:41:53 -> 00:41:55]  Y cyntaf yw ymgyrchu tonic-clonic
[00:41:55 -> 00:41:58]  ac y cyntaf yw ymgyrchu ffocal.
[00:41:58 -> 00:42:01]  Felly ymgyrchu tonic-clonic yw efallai
[00:42:01 -> 00:42:04]  y peth cyntaf o ymgyrchu sy'n dod i'w meddwl y gwelwch chi'n ei weld yn ffilmiau.
[00:42:04 -> 00:42:07]  Felly dyma pan fydd rhywun yn mynd i'r fflwr
[00:42:07 -> 00:42:09]  ac mae cymdeithasau musglau anhygoel.
[00:42:09 -> 00:42:13]  Felly mae rhai cymdeithasau anhygoel ac mae'n gallu bod yn anhygoel i'w gweld.
[00:42:13 -> 00:42:17]  Efallai y bydd rhywun yn cydweithio ar y chwrs
[00:42:17 -> 00:42:20]  a hefyd efallai y byddant yn ymgyrchu eu hunain,
[00:42:20 -> 00:42:21]  y gwleidiau yn mynd i'r ôl,
[00:42:21 -> 00:42:24]  efallai y byddant yn stopio ychydig o amser
[00:42:24 -> 00:42:26]  a hefyd efallai y bydd rhan o'r glan ar y myfyrwyr hefyd
[00:42:26 -> 00:42:28]  lle efallai y byddent wedi pwysleisio eu tŷn.
[00:42:28 -> 00:42:31]  Felly os ydych chi'n profi rhywun sy'n cael ymgyrchu
[00:42:31 -> 00:42:32]  yr hyn rydych chi'n mynd i'w wneud fel ymgyrchu cyntaf
[00:42:32 -> 00:42:35]  yw gwneud yn siŵr nad oes unrhyw ddangos ar ôl,
[00:42:35 -> 00:42:37]  yn enwedig i'r casgliad hefyd,
[00:42:37 -> 00:42:40]  o ran unrhyw beth y gallent gweithio eu tŷn i mewn
[00:42:40 -> 00:42:41]  neu eu llwybrau i mewn
[00:42:41 -> 00:42:43]  ac hefyd rydyn ni'n mynd i gynllunio eu tywyll
[00:42:43 -> 00:42:46]  felly trwy gosod rhywbeth llawn o dannydd.
[00:42:46 -> 00:42:49]  Ie, felly rydych chi wedi ymgyrchu am ddangos
[00:42:49 -> 00:42:50]  ac yna o'r pwynt hwnnw,
[00:42:50 -> 00:42:52]  os ydyn nhw'n dal i gael eu tŷn,
[00:42:52 -> 00:42:54]  rydyn ni'n mynd i gynllunio'r ddangos.
[00:42:54 -> 00:42:56]  Y rheswm rydyn ni'n gynllunio'r ddangos,
[00:42:56 -> 00:42:57]  os yw'n mynd i mewn i fwy na 5 munud,
[00:42:57 -> 00:42:59]  gallai hynny fod yn ddangos iawn ar gyfer y casgliad,
[00:42:59 -> 00:43:00]  felly rhaid i ni wneud yn siŵr
[00:43:00 -> 00:43:02]  bod ambulans ar ei ffordd.
[00:43:02 -> 00:43:05]  Ie, felly rydyn ni'n gynllunio'r ddangos,
[00:43:05 -> 00:43:07]  os ydyn nhw'n dal i gael eu tŷn
[00:43:07 -> 00:43:08]  ac mae'r mwynebion nhw wedi dal i gael eu tŷn
[00:43:08 -> 00:43:09]  ac mae'n ddiogel i ni wneud hynny,
[00:43:09 -> 00:43:11]  felly rydyn ni'n mynd i ymdrech i'r casgliad
[00:43:11 -> 00:43:13]  ac rydyn ni'n mynd i ymdrechu'n gyntaf.
[00:43:13 -> 00:43:15]  Felly rydyn ni wedi ysgrifennu ar gyfer y ddangos,
[00:43:15 -> 00:43:16]  rydyn ni'n mynd i ysgrifennu ar gyfer y rheswm
[00:43:16 -> 00:43:18]  ac yna ysgrifennu ar gyfer y bryd.
[00:43:18 -> 00:43:20]  Felly, mae epilepsi yn un o'r rheswm
[00:43:20 -> 00:43:22]  pwysig y bydd rhywun yn cael seisiau,
[00:43:22 -> 00:43:23]  mae llawer o eraill,
[00:43:23 -> 00:43:25]  ac un o'r eraill yw ymgyrchu cardiaid,
[00:43:25 -> 00:43:27]  felly dyna pam mae'n bwysig iawn
[00:43:27 -> 00:43:28]  y byddwn ni'n ysgrifennu ar gyfer y bryd
[00:43:29 -> 00:43:30]  Os ydyn nhw'n ysgrifennu,
[00:43:30 -> 00:43:33]  yna mae'n rhaid i ni eu lleihau i sefydliad ymgyrchu
[00:43:33 -> 00:43:36]  er mwyn sicrhau ein bod ni'n gallu cymryd ymdrech yn agos.
[00:43:36 -> 00:43:38]  Ac mae'n rhaid i ni wneud yn siŵr
[00:43:38 -> 00:43:39]  bod ambulans ar ei ffyrdd
[00:43:39 -> 00:43:40]  os yw'n fwy na 5 munud
[00:43:40 -> 00:43:42]  y byddant yn eu seisiau,
[00:43:42 -> 00:43:43]  os nad ydyn nhw'n dod ymlaen
[00:43:43 -> 00:43:45]  ac yna gael seisiau arall,
[00:43:45 -> 00:43:47]  neu os ydyn ni'n gwybod ei fod yn eu seisiau cyntaf,
[00:43:47 -> 00:43:48]  neu dydyn ni ddim yn siŵr,
[00:43:48 -> 00:43:49]  efallai nad ydyn ni'n gwybod y bobl hwn
[00:43:50 -> 00:43:51]  ac maen nhw wedi cael seisiau
[00:43:51 -> 00:43:52]  yn gofyn ambulans.
[00:43:53 -> 00:43:55]  Y ffordd arall rydw i wedi ei ddweud yn gyntaf
[00:43:55 -> 00:43:57]  yw seisiau ffocal.
[00:43:58 -> 00:44:00]  Felly dyma lle y bydd rhywun
[00:44:00 -> 00:44:03]  yn ymwneud â gweld ymlaen,
[00:44:03 -> 00:44:04]  felly seisiau anhygoel.
[00:44:05 -> 00:44:07]  Efallai hefyd yn cynnwys
[00:44:07 -> 00:44:08]  ysgrifennu,
[00:44:08 -> 00:44:09]  ysgrifennu yn agos,
[00:44:09 -> 00:44:10]  ysgrifennu,
[00:44:10 -> 00:44:13]  a phobl sy'n mynd ymlaen,
[00:44:13 -> 00:44:15]  efallai ysgrifennu ymlaen.
[00:44:15 -> 00:44:16]  Felly gallai hyn hefyd fod yn ddangos iawn
[00:44:16 -> 00:44:17]  ar gyfer casgliad,
[00:44:17 -> 00:44:19]  yn enwedig os ydyn nhw mewn amgylchedd
[00:44:19 -> 00:44:21]  neu unrhyw beth fel hyn.
[00:44:21 -> 00:44:23]  Felly rhaid i ni geisio
[00:44:23 -> 00:44:24]  gael nhw'n ysgrifennu os ydyn nhw'n gallu
[00:44:24 -> 00:44:26]  mewn amgylchedd anhygoel.
[00:44:26 -> 00:44:28]  Dydyn ni ddim yn ceisio gwneud nhw allan o hynny,
[00:44:28 -> 00:44:30]  gwneud iddyn nhw gael eu seisiau.
[00:44:30 -> 00:44:31]  Ac eto, teimlo,
[00:44:31 -> 00:44:32]  os yw'n fwy nag 5 munud,
[00:44:32 -> 00:44:34]  gofyn ambulans.
[00:44:34 -> 00:44:35]  Os nad ydych chi'n gwybod
[00:44:35 -> 00:44:36]  bod nhw wedi cael seisiau o'r blaen,
[00:44:36 -> 00:44:38]  gofyn ambulans.
[00:44:38 -> 00:44:40]  Ie, a bod yn ddiolchgar iawn
[00:44:40 -> 00:44:41]  pan ydyn nhw'n gofyn
[00:44:41 -> 00:44:43]  a'u gofyn lle ydyn nhw.
[00:44:43 -> 00:44:44]  Ie.
[00:44:44 -> 00:44:46]  Felly, mwy o ddim
[00:44:46 -> 00:44:47]  pan ydyn nhw'n cael seisiau.
[00:44:47 -> 00:44:48]  Dydyn ni ddim yn ceisio
[00:44:48 -> 00:44:50]  gwneud iddyn nhw allan o hynny.
[00:44:50 -> 00:44:51]  Felly, gwneud iddyn nhw allan o hynny
[00:44:51 -> 00:44:52]  trwy ceisio eu hyfforddi
[00:44:52 -> 00:44:53]  neu unrhyw beth fel hynny.
[00:44:53 -> 00:44:54]  Pan ydyn nhw'n cael
[00:44:54 -> 00:44:55]  seisiau tonic-clonic,
[00:44:55 -> 00:44:56]  felly ydyn nhw ar y fflwr
[00:44:56 -> 00:44:57]  yn cael eu
[00:44:57 -> 00:44:58]  gweithgareddau musglau amgylcheddol,
[00:44:58 -> 00:44:58]  dydyn ni ddim yn ceisio
[00:44:58 -> 00:44:59]  ymddangos iddyn nhw mewn unrhyw ffordd
[00:44:59 -> 00:45:00]  oherwydd gallai hynny
[00:45:00 -> 00:45:01]  gael damau mwy
[00:45:01 -> 00:45:03]  a hefyd i chi eich hun
[00:45:03 -> 00:45:03]  hefyd, mae rhywun yn mynd i fod
[00:45:03 -> 00:45:04]  yn y bwysig
[00:45:04 -> 00:45:06]  pan ydyn nhw'n y stade honno.
[00:45:06 -> 00:45:07]  Felly, gwnewch yn ôl
[00:45:07 -> 00:45:09]  a chael y seisiau i ddigwydd.
[00:45:12 -> 00:45:13]  Ie, felly, mae'n dod o fod
[00:45:13 -> 00:45:14]  y dyn yma
[00:45:14 -> 00:45:16]  yn cael seisiau.
[00:45:16 -> 00:45:18]  Mae rhai gweithgareddau musglau
[00:45:18 -> 00:45:20]  anhygoel a ddim yn cael eu gweithgareddau.
[00:45:20 -> 00:45:22]  Efallai hefyd y gwelwch
[00:45:22 -> 00:45:23]  eu bod nhw'n eu hwylo
[00:45:23 -> 00:45:24]  efallai eu bod nhw'n eu gwneud
[00:45:24 -> 00:45:24]  yn y myfyrwyr
[00:45:24 -> 00:45:25]  neu efallai efallai
[00:45:25 -> 00:45:26]  bod yna dŵr
[00:45:30 -> 00:45:32]  sy'n anodd i'w gweld.
[00:45:32 -> 00:45:33]  Gwnewch eich bod hi'n ddangos.
[00:45:33 -> 00:45:34]  Os oes unrhyw beth
[00:45:34 -> 00:45:34]  efallai sy'n gallu
[00:45:34 -> 00:45:36]  rhannu'r casgliad
[00:45:36 -> 00:45:37]  cynyddu hynny allan
[00:45:37 -> 00:45:37]  er mwyn iddyn nhw ddim
[00:45:37 -> 00:45:38]  nodi eu hwnnw
[00:45:38 -> 00:45:39]  neu eu hynny
[00:45:39 -> 00:45:40]  neu eu hwnnw
[00:45:40 -> 00:45:42]  neu unrhyw rhan o'u bod.
[00:45:42 -> 00:45:42]  Os oes gennych
[00:45:42 -> 00:45:43]  cardigan,
[00:45:43 -> 00:45:44]  jumper
[00:45:44 -> 00:45:44]  neu pyllo
[00:45:44 -> 00:45:45]  o unrhyw ffordd
[00:45:45 -> 00:45:45]  gobeithiwch eich bod chi'n gwneud
[00:45:45 -> 00:45:46]  yn ystod eu hwnnw
[00:45:46 -> 00:45:47]  er mwyn eu gweithredu
[00:45:47 -> 00:45:48]  o ddod i'r fflwr
[00:45:48 -> 00:45:49]  os ydyn nhw'n ystod
[00:45:50 -> 00:45:52]  nid ychwanegwch eich ddŵr y tu ôl
[00:45:52 -> 00:45:53]  oherwydd gallwch
[00:45:53 -> 00:45:53]  gael ffingrau bryd.
[00:45:53 -> 00:45:55]  Byddant'n mynd i fod yn fawr iawn.
[00:45:55 -> 00:45:56]  Gwneud yn siŵr eich bod chi'n
[00:45:56 -> 00:45:56]  dod yn ôl'n iawn
[00:45:56 -> 00:45:57]  wrth eu bod yn cael eu
[00:45:57 -> 00:45:58]  sysio
[00:45:58 -> 00:46:00]  ac amseru'r sysio.
[00:46:00 -> 00:46:00]  Os yw'n unrhyw ddŵr
[00:46:00 -> 00:46:01]  mwy na 5 munud
[00:46:01 -> 00:46:02]  yna mae'n rhaid i ni
[00:46:02 -> 00:46:03]  ddweud yr ambulans.
[00:46:03 -> 00:46:04]  Os nad ydyn ni'n credu
[00:46:04 -> 00:46:04]  eu bod wedi cael
[00:46:04 -> 00:46:05]  sysio o'r blaen
[00:46:05 -> 00:46:06]  yna mae'n rhaid i ni
[00:46:06 -> 00:46:06]  ddweud yr ambulans
[00:46:06 -> 00:46:07]  ac os ydyn nhw'n
[00:46:07 -> 00:46:08]  cael eu sysio
[00:46:08 -> 00:46:08]  mae'n rhaid i ni
[00:46:08 -> 00:46:09]  ddweud yr ambulans.
[00:46:09 -> 00:46:10]  Yn ystod eu bod wedi
[00:46:10 -> 00:46:11]  ddweud eu bod wedi cael
[00:46:11 -> 00:46:12]  eu sysio
[00:46:12 -> 00:46:14]  mae'n bwysig
[00:46:14 -> 00:46:14]  ysgrifennu i ysgrifennu
[00:46:14 -> 00:46:16]  ychydig yn gyflym.
[00:46:16 -> 00:46:17]  Felly
[00:46:17 -> 00:46:18]  efallai ychydig o
[00:46:18 -> 00:46:18]  sysioau
[00:46:18 -> 00:46:19]  ychydig yn ysgrifennu
[00:46:19 -> 00:46:21]  ychydig yn ysgrifennu
[00:46:21 -> 00:46:21]  felly mae'n rhaid i ni
[00:46:21 -> 00:46:22]  agor y fflwm
[00:46:22 -> 00:46:23]  ac ysgrifennu i ysgrifennu.
[00:46:28 -> 00:46:29]  Mae'r dyn yma yn ysgrifennu
[00:46:29 -> 00:46:30]  felly dwi'n mynd i
[00:46:30 -> 00:46:31]  gofyn am ambulans
[00:46:31 -> 00:46:32]  oherwydd dwi ddim yn gwybod
[00:46:32 -> 00:46:33]  os ydyn nhw wedi
[00:46:33 -> 00:46:34]  os ydyn nhw wedi cael epilepsi
[00:46:34 -> 00:46:35]  neu beth sy'n digwydd
[00:46:35 -> 00:46:37]  gyda'r casgliad yma.
[00:46:37 -> 00:46:38]  Felly dwi'n mynd i
[00:46:38 -> 00:46:39]  gofyn am ambulans
[00:46:39 -> 00:46:39]  a'i leihau
[00:46:39 -> 00:46:40]  mewn sefydliad ymdrech.
[00:46:44 -> 00:46:45]  Fy enw i yw Michelle
[00:46:45 -> 00:46:46]  fi yw'r cyflwr cyntaf
[00:46:46 -> 00:46:46]  dwi'n mynd i
[00:46:46 -> 00:46:47]  rhoi chi mewn
[00:46:47 -> 00:46:48]  sefydliad mwy ysgrifennol.
[00:46:53 -> 00:46:54]  Felly
[00:46:54 -> 00:46:56]  gweithiwch ysgrifennu iddyn nhw.
[00:46:56 -> 00:46:56]  Mae'r ysgrifennu
[00:46:56 -> 00:46:57]  yw'r diweddarach
[00:46:57 -> 00:46:57]  i fynd ymlaen
[00:47:00 -> 00:47:01]  i allu clywed chi.
[00:47:01 -> 00:47:02]  Ac mae'n rhaid i chi
[00:47:02 -> 00:47:03]  gofyn iddyn nhw
[00:47:03 -> 00:47:03]  ac ysgrifennu'n ôl
[00:47:03 -> 00:47:04]  ar eu hyfforddi
[00:47:04 -> 00:47:06]  o'r sefydliad yma.
[00:47:11 -> 00:47:11]  Iawn, felly
[00:47:11 -> 00:47:12]  yn y cwrs gweithio
[00:47:12 -> 00:47:13]  cyntaf ymdrech
[00:47:13 -> 00:47:13]  rydyn ni'n mynd i edrych
[00:47:13 -> 00:47:14]  ar ddau ffordd gwahanol
[00:47:14 -> 00:47:15]  o ysgrifennu.
[00:47:15 -> 00:47:15]  Felly mae gennym
[00:47:15 -> 00:47:17]  ein ysgrifennu cyffredinol,
[00:47:17 -> 00:47:18]  ein cyffredin cyffredinol
[00:47:18 -> 00:47:20]  a'n ysgrifennu cyffredin cyflawn.
[00:47:20 -> 00:47:22]  Felly os yw'n ysgrifennu cyffredinol
[00:47:22 -> 00:47:23]  byddwch chi'n gweld
[00:47:23 -> 00:47:24]  gwyrdd
[00:47:24 -> 00:47:25]  a dim ond y ffordd gwahanol
[00:47:25 -> 00:47:26]  o'r sgin sydd wedi'i effeithio.
[00:47:26 -> 00:47:26]  Felly mae'n mynd i fod
[00:47:26 -> 00:47:27]  yn agos
[00:47:27 -> 00:47:31]  ac yn agos i ddefnyddio.
[00:47:31 -> 00:47:31]  Yr hyn rydyn ni'n mynd i wneud
[00:47:31 -> 00:47:32]  ar gyfer y cyffredinol
[00:47:32 -> 00:47:34]  yw'i rhannu ar dŵr glan,
[00:47:34 -> 00:47:35]  felly dŵr glan glan
[00:47:35 -> 00:47:38]  am ychydig o 10 munud.
[00:47:38 -> 00:47:39]  Efallai y mae'n rhaid i ni
[00:47:39 -> 00:47:39]  rhoi'r ysgrifennu cyffredinol
[00:47:39 -> 00:47:40]  i'r ysgrifennu
[00:47:40 -> 00:47:41]  yn ymdrech
[00:47:41 -> 00:47:42]  ar nifer o bethau.
[00:47:42 -> 00:47:43]  Felly,
[00:47:43 -> 00:47:44]  os yw'n o hyd
[00:47:44 -> 00:47:45]  ar y cyffredinol
[00:47:45 -> 00:47:45]  y byddai'n rhaid iddyn nhw
[00:47:45 -> 00:47:46]  mynd i'r ysgrifennu,
[00:47:46 -> 00:47:47]  ond hefyd
[00:47:47 -> 00:47:47]  os yw'n o hyd
[00:47:47 -> 00:47:48]  mwy na 5%
[00:47:48 -> 00:47:49]  o'u llywodraeth.
[00:47:49 -> 00:47:49]  Felly,
[00:47:49 -> 00:47:50]  sut ydyn ni'n gwybod
[00:47:50 -> 00:47:50]  os yw'n o hyd
[00:47:50 -> 00:47:51]  mwy na 5%
[00:47:51 -> 00:47:52]  o'u llywodraeth?
[00:47:52 -> 00:47:53]  1%
[00:47:53 -> 00:47:54]  byddai'r cyffredinol
[00:47:54 -> 00:47:56]  yn ychydig o dŵr glan.
[00:47:56 -> 00:47:56]  Felly,
[00:47:56 -> 00:47:57]  os yw'n o hyd
[00:47:57 -> 00:47:58]  mwy na 5%
[00:47:58 -> 00:47:59]  o dŵr glan
[00:47:59 -> 00:48:00]  y byddai'n rhaid iddyn nhw
[00:48:00 -> 00:48:02]  mynd i'r ysgrifennu.
[00:48:02 -> 00:48:03]  Ar gyfer y cyffredinol
[00:48:03 -> 00:48:03]  cyffredinol,
[00:48:03 -> 00:48:04]  efallai y byddwch chi'n gweld
[00:48:04 -> 00:48:05]  rhywbeth sy'n glir
[00:48:05 -> 00:48:07]  a rhywbeth sy'n rhannu'r dŵr glan.
[00:48:07 -> 00:48:08]  Os ydych chi'n gweld hynny,
[00:48:08 -> 00:48:08]  eto,
[00:48:08 -> 00:48:09]  rhannwch hynny'n dŵr glan
[00:48:09 -> 00:48:11]  am ychydig o 10 munud
[00:48:11 -> 00:48:12]  ac yna edrychwch
[00:48:12 -> 00:48:14]  ar ddefnyddio rhywfaint
[00:48:14 -> 00:48:16]  o dŵr glan dyddiadur.
[00:48:16 -> 00:48:17]  Felly, rhywbeth sy'n hyfforddiol.
[00:48:17 -> 00:48:18]  Os ydych chi'n cael
[00:48:18 -> 00:48:18]  rhyw dŵr glan cyffredinol
[00:48:18 -> 00:48:19]  neu rhywbeth fel hynny,
[00:48:19 -> 00:48:20]  yna mae hynny'n briliant.
[00:48:20 -> 00:48:20]  Ychydig o dŵr glan
[00:48:21 -> 00:48:22]  Ac yna,
[00:48:22 -> 00:48:24]  dymuno hwnnw ar y sgriwn
[00:48:24 -> 00:48:25]  a gwneud gyda'r sgriwn
[00:48:25 -> 00:48:27]  ymhellach ar y dŵr.
[00:48:27 -> 00:48:28]  Dydwch ddim yn ei wneud
[00:48:28 -> 00:48:28]  hyd yn oed.
[00:48:28 -> 00:48:29]  Dydwch ddim yn ei gyfro
[00:48:29 -> 00:48:30]  o gwmpas y sgriwn.
[00:48:32 -> 00:48:33]  Am ychydig o rhywfaint o glan,
[00:48:33 -> 00:48:35]  os yw mwy na 1%
[00:48:35 -> 00:48:36]  o'r bobl credwyr,
[00:48:36 -> 00:48:37]  felly dim ond un o'r palm
[00:48:37 -> 00:48:38]  o'u rhan
[00:48:38 -> 00:48:38]  yna byddai'n angen
[00:48:38 -> 00:48:40]  mynd at y ysgol.
[00:48:40 -> 00:48:40]  Neu, os ydych chi'n beryglu
[00:48:40 -> 00:48:41]  am unrhyw gysylltiedd
[00:48:41 -> 00:48:45]  nid ydyn nhw'n siŵr, gwnewch iddyn nhw fynd i'r ysgol i wneud y pwyswyl, gwnewch iddyn nhw'n iawn.
[00:48:46 -> 00:48:49]  Ar gyfer ffyrdd fwy, bydd hwn yn bwysig iawn.
[00:48:50 -> 00:48:53]  Byddai'n edrych yn dda iawn, byddai ychydig o adnoddau waxig
[00:48:53 -> 00:48:57]  ac efallai hefyd ychydig o'r nerf, felly efallai nad ydyn nhw'n cael teimlad o unrhyw fath o achosion.
[00:48:57 -> 00:48:59]  Efallai y mae'n rhaid i ni wneud ymwneud â'r sioc,
[00:48:59 -> 00:49:01]  ac efallai y mae'n rhaid i chi gyrraedd rai cefnogaethau bywydol,
[00:49:01 -> 00:49:05]  felly cyfnod CPR os oeddent yn deall eu bod yn ddeall eu bywydau, neu'n mynd i'r sioc.
[00:49:06 -> 00:49:08]  Felly, ar gyfer ychydig o ffyrdd fwy,
[00:49:08 -> 00:49:11]  efallai, gwnewch ei gyrraedd ar dŵr i'r amser cymaint o 10 munud,
[00:49:11 -> 00:49:14]  a hefyd argeisio rhagor,
[00:49:14 -> 00:49:16]  a'u cyflwyno i'r ambulans yn gyflym fel y gall.
[00:49:17 -> 00:49:20]  Iawn, felly, mewn yr egwyl hwn, mae gennym ychydig o fyrdd ar gyfer ychydig o ffyrdd.
[00:49:20 -> 00:49:24]  Felly, fel y gallwch ei weld, mae'r rhagor yma, mae'n ddiddor iawn iddo ei wneud,
[00:49:24 -> 00:49:26]  ac mae'n ddiddor iawn i'w gysylltu.
[00:49:26 -> 00:49:28]  Felly, yr hyn rydyn ni'n mynd i'w wneud yn gyflym fel y gall,
[00:49:28 -> 00:49:30]  yw rhoi iddo ei gyrraedd ar dŵr i'r ambulans.
[00:49:30 -> 00:49:33]  Mae'n bwysig nad yw'n ddiddor iawn, ac nid yw'n ddiddor iawn.
[00:49:33 -> 00:49:35]  Dydyn ni ddim eisiau cael hypothermia.
[00:49:35 -> 00:49:37]  Os nad ydyn ni'n gallu rhoi iddo ei gyrraedd ar dŵr,
[00:49:37 -> 00:49:40]  gallwn ddod â'r dŵr iddo ei gyrraedd.
[00:49:40 -> 00:49:41]  Iawn.
[00:49:45 -> 00:49:48]  Dw i'n mynd i ddod â'r dŵr ar eich cymaint nawr.
[00:49:49 -> 00:49:53]  Yr hyn rydyn ni'n ei wneud yw gwneud hyn ar gyfer 10 munud.
[00:49:53 -> 00:49:55]  Felly, os ydych chi'n rhaid i chi ddod â'r dŵr iddo ei gyrraedd,
[00:49:55 -> 00:49:58]  byddwch chi angen rhywun i ddod â'ch cymaint o dŵr.
[00:49:58 -> 00:50:00]  Gwneud yn siŵr bod eich casgliadau yn teimlo'n iawn,
[00:50:00 -> 00:50:04]  ac os ydyn nhw'n ei gyrraedd, gadewch iddyn nhw i'w gyrraedd.
[00:50:08 -> 00:50:10]  Ar ôl 10 munud,
[00:50:10 -> 00:50:13]  byddwn ni'n edrych ar y gysylltiad.
[00:50:13 -> 00:50:15]  Os oes unrhyw blister yn ymddangos neu unrhyw beth fel hynny,
[00:50:15 -> 00:50:18]  byddwn ni'n rhaid iddyn nhw mynd i'r ysgol.
[00:50:18 -> 00:50:22]  Os ydyn ni'n rhaid i unrhyw ddefnyddiad, gallwn ni ei gyflawni gyda ddresin steril.
[00:50:22 -> 00:50:24]  Rhywbeth fel dŵr cyffredin yw ddiddorol.
[00:50:24 -> 00:50:26]  Ychwanegwch y rôl cyntaf,
[00:50:26 -> 00:50:30]  ac yna defnyddwch y llwybrau ar ôl hynny i fod yn steril.
[00:50:30 -> 00:50:34]  Gadewch i ni leihau dŵr cyffredin ar y dŵr,
[00:50:34 -> 00:50:36]  ac ychwanegwch ychydig ar y dŵr.
[00:50:36 -> 00:50:38]  Nid yw'n ei wneud mewn ffwrdd.
[00:50:38 -> 00:50:40]  Ond gallwn ni'n edrych ar y gysylltiad,
[00:50:40 -> 00:50:43]  ac ychwanegwch y dŵr ar ôl hynny i weld beth sy'n digwydd gyda hynny.
[00:50:43 -> 00:50:47]  Os yw'n ben ychydig ar y dŵr cyffredin fel hyn,
[00:50:47 -> 00:50:49]  ac nid yw'n rhaid iddyn nhw fynd i'r ysgol,
[00:50:49 -> 00:50:52]  ond fel rwy'n dweud, os oes unrhyw broblemau o ddefnyddio,
[00:50:52 -> 00:50:54]  yna byddwn yn ei wneud.
[00:50:58 -> 00:51:01]  Felly rwy'n edrych ar rai mwyaf o ddysgwyr fwyaf nawr.
[00:51:01 -> 00:51:05]  Os yw rhywun yn cael dŵr cyffredin yn ei dŵr,
[00:51:05 -> 00:51:08]  neu os ydyn nhw'n mynd i ddewis rhywbeth sy'n gallu bod yn hawrus.
[00:51:08 -> 00:51:10]  Felly rwy'n mynd i ddweud i chi beth i'w wneud yno.
[00:51:10 -> 00:51:13]  Felly os yw rhywun yn cael rhywbeth sy'n cael ei ddewis yn ei dŵr neu'i nos,
[00:51:13 -> 00:51:15]  ac mae'n cael ei ddewis yn y dŵr,
[00:51:15 -> 00:51:17]  nid yw'n rhaid iddyn nhw ymwneud â phwyso'r dŵr,
[00:51:17 -> 00:51:19]  neu gwneud iddyn nhw ffwrddio'r dŵr,
[00:51:19 -> 00:51:21]  trwy ffwrddio o'u nostrilau.
[00:51:21 -> 00:51:23]  Rhaid iddyn nhw ddewis ei ddewis yn y dŵr,
[00:51:23 -> 00:51:26]  a hyrwyddo iddyn nhw i fynd i'r GP,
[00:51:26 -> 00:51:28]  neu i'r A&E i'w gadael,
[00:51:28 -> 00:51:31]  oherwydd gallwn wneud rhywfaint o dŵr iawn i'r dŵr a'r nostrilau.
[00:51:32 -> 00:51:35]  Os yw rhywun wedi mynd i ddewis rhywbeth sy'n golygu ei fod yn anodd,
[00:51:35 -> 00:51:39]  felly efallai un o'r dŵr neu rhywbeth fel hyn,
[00:51:39 -> 00:51:40]  os oes un o'r bobl ifanc,
[00:51:40 -> 00:51:42]  neu os oes rhywbeth yn y dŵr rydyn nhw ddim yn gwybod
[00:51:42 -> 00:51:45]  ac maen nhw wedi mynd i ddewis rhywbeth fel hyn.
[00:51:45 -> 00:51:47]  Yn ymwneud â'r hyn sydd,
[00:51:47 -> 00:51:49]  bydd yn ymwneud â'u bod yn anodd i fynd i'r hospital.
[00:51:49 -> 00:51:52]  Os yw rhywbeth fel dŵr sydd yn y dŵr sy'n anodd,
[00:51:52 -> 00:51:54]  neu un o'r dŵr sydd yn y dŵr sy'n anodd,
[00:51:54 -> 00:51:56]  neu mewn gwirionedd fy hun,
[00:51:56 -> 00:51:58]  os oes glas yn fy mÙn,
[00:51:58 -> 00:52:01]  mae'r glas yn gallu gwneud llawer o dynion i chi i mewn hefyd,
[00:52:01 -> 00:52:04]  felly byddwn ni'n ymwneud â eu bod nhw'n mynd i'r hospital.
[00:52:05 -> 00:52:07]  Neu efallai ddweud y cyfarfodydd arall,
[00:52:07 -> 00:52:09]  felly gallwch ddweud 111
[00:52:09 -> 00:52:12]  a gwneud iddyn nhw ddweud a ydyn nhw'n ymwneud â eu bod yn mynd i'r hospital
[00:52:12 -> 00:52:15]  fel arall i allu gwneud gwasanaethau.
[00:52:19 -> 00:52:23]  Os ydych chi'n cael ymddiried â rhywun sydd â glas fawr,
[00:52:23 -> 00:52:26]  mae'n bwysig bod ni'n hallu'r glas yn ystod y cyfnod o'r amser.
[00:52:26 -> 00:52:28]  Felly byddwn ni'n gofyn i'r cyfarfodydd
[00:52:28 -> 00:52:30]  adeiladu prysur ddiwethaf drwy'r glas.
[00:52:30 -> 00:52:32]  Felly os ydych chi'n gallu gwneud hynny i mi
[00:52:32 -> 00:52:34]  a diwethaf prysur ddiwethaf drwy'r glas,
[00:52:34 -> 00:52:35]  rhoi'r glas yn dda ac yn ffyrddus.
[00:52:35 -> 00:52:37]  Yr hyn y byddwn i'n ei wneud yw gofyn i'r cyfarfodydd
[00:52:37 -> 00:52:41]  Mae gross bros y flynyddyn,rovell methodem.
[00:52:41 -> 00:52:45]  Dyw hyn ddim yn iawn i mi er mwyn Rosy'n gwybod.
[00:52:53 -> 00:52:56]  Ac yna gyda mwy i ddim, a daeth y printer eu mynyddo.
[00:52:56 -> 00:52:59]  Iawn i mi, ddangos iddi ffigur hwn,
[00:53:02 -> 00:53:04]  rwan ffoc,
[00:53:05 -> 00:53:05]  rwan ffoc,
[00:53:05 -> 00:53:06]  ffoc,
[00:53:06 -> 00:53:07]  dmo'rrehau,
[00:53:07 -> 00:53:22]  Felly, os ydych chi'n mynd i ddechrau eich dŵr i mi, gadewch i mi ddweud a yw hyn yn teimlo'n
[00:53:22 -> 00:53:23]  teimlo'n dda iawn.
[00:53:23 -> 00:53:26]  Felly rydych chi eisiau i'r bandage fod yn dda iawn ac yn teimlo'n dda iawn, ond dydych chi ddim
[00:53:26 -> 00:53:34]  eisiau ei gadael o'r cyffredin, felly edrychwch yn ôl â'ch casgliad.
[00:53:34 -> 00:53:51]  Iawn, felly gwneud yn siŵr bod yr holl bandage'n cyflwyno'n gyflym, felly gallwn wneud yn siŵr
[00:53:51 -> 00:53:59]  bod cymaint o wanan cymryd yn gallu leiaf.
[00:54:04 -> 00:54:08]  Iawn, felly os gwnaethoch chi neud pryswythi unwaith i ef wrth ddarganfod.
[00:54:08 -> 00:54:09]  Rydw i'n mynd i'r hyn.
[00:54:09 -> 00:54:15]  Feelly byddai y雷 hwn yn gwneud heibio amad torri am fferth siok.
[00:54:15 -> 00:54:28]  Mae'n ymwneud â teimlad o ddiddordeb, mae'n dŵr i'r dechrau, mae ganddyn nhw hartref cyflym a llwyddiant, ac mae'n teimlo'n ddiddordeb.
[00:54:28 -> 00:54:32]  Felly beth rydw i'n mynd i'w wneud yw ei leihau i mewn fel yw e, ac ychydig i'r llwybrau.
[00:54:35 -> 00:54:38]  Gallwch chi helpu i ychydig i'r llwybrau, mae'n dda.
[00:54:39 -> 00:54:41]  Ydy hynny'n hyfryd?
[00:54:47 -> 00:54:51]  Rhowch yn siŵr eich bod chi wedi'i ddweud 999 yn gyflym iawn.
[00:54:51 -> 00:54:55]  Dechreuwch i siarad â'ch ddiddordeb a chael eich bod yn barod i ddechrau cefnogaeth bywyd.
[00:54:55 -> 00:55:00]  Os yw'r llwybrau yn dod trwy'r ddiddordeb hwn, byddwn ni'n ei wneud oherwydd ddod trwy'r ddiddordeb arall.
[00:55:00 -> 00:55:05]  Os oedd yn dod trwy'r ddiddordeb arall, byddwn ni'n ei alluogi a dechrau'r broses eto.
[00:55:06 -> 00:55:08]  Rhowch eich bod chi'n dda i'r llwybrau.
[00:55:08 -> 00:55:12]  Nid y gallwn ni roi i'r ddiddordeb unrhyw beth i'w ddynnu, gwylio neu ffwrddio.
[00:55:12 -> 00:55:15]  Rhowch yn dda i'r ddiddordeb.
[00:55:15 -> 00:55:20]  Gadewch i'r ddiddordeb ei ddod trwy'r ddiddordeb.
[00:55:20 -> 00:55:23]  A byddwch yn barod i ddechrau cefnogaeth bywyd os yw'n angen.
[00:55:27 -> 00:55:30]  Rydw i'n mynd i siarad am ddau ffordd o ddiweddarau llwybrau.
[00:55:30 -> 00:55:35]  Y cyntaf yw angina, lle mae'r dyniad i'r holl ddiddordeb wedi'i gysylltu.
[00:55:35 -> 00:55:42]  Yn aml, byddai rhywun wedi cael ei ddiagnos gyda hyn, felly efallai eu bod yn gallu cymryd ymddygiad.
[00:55:43 -> 00:55:47]  Yn aml, mae'n cael ei ddarparu trwy gweithgaredd ffysig.
[00:55:47 -> 00:55:55]  Yn aml, pan fyddant wedi ysbryd, byddwch chi'n gweld cynyddu cyflym, neu pan fyddant wedi cymryd ymddygiad, byddwch chi'n gweld eu cynyddu'n gyflym.
[00:55:56 -> 00:56:00]  Os ydych chi'n ddiddordeb ac nid yw'r ymddygiad yn gweithio, yna ddweud 999.
[00:56:01 -> 00:56:14]  Yr amgylchedd ychydig yw hartref, felly dyma pan mae'r ddiddordeb wedi'i gwblhau'n gyflym, felly mae rhan o'r hartref wedi'i gwblhau'n gyflym.
[00:56:15 -> 00:56:18]  Felly gallai hyn fod yn anodd, ac mae'n bwysig ein bod ni'n ei wneud gyda hynny'n gyflym.
[00:56:19 -> 00:56:25]  Yr amgylcheddau a'r syniadau y byddwch chi'n eu gweld ar hyn o bryd yw bod rhywun yn ymddygiad o ddiddordeb cyffredin neu gysylltiedig o gwmpas y cyffredin.
[00:56:26 -> 00:56:30]  Efallai y dywedodd eu bod eu llawn yn dynnu, yn amlwg mae'r llawn ddiweddar yn gyntaf, ond gallai hefyd fod y llawn ddiweddar.
[00:56:31 -> 00:56:35]  Efallai hefyd y dywedodd eu bod yn ymddygiad o ddiddordeb yn yr ystafell, y chwrdd a'r ddiddordeb.
[00:56:36 -> 00:56:43]  Efallai hefyd y dywedodd eu bod yn ymddygiad o ddiddordeb neu mewn gwirionedd yn iach, yn teimlo'n ddiddordeb.
[00:56:44 -> 00:56:47]  Efallai y dywedodd eu bod yn ddiddordeb a'n dechrau edrych yn ddiddordeb.
[00:56:48 -> 00:56:54]  Nid yw ddwy ymddygiad o ddiddordeb yn yr un peth, ac efallai eu bod yn edrych yn wahanol ar gyfer pob unigol, ac efallai nad ydyn nhw'n ymddygiad o'r holl hynny.
[00:56:54 -> 00:57:01]  Felly dywedwch am yr holl fathau gwahanol o ddiddordeb a syniadau, ac os yw'n ddiddordeb, ysgrifennwch amgylchedd yn gyflym.
[00:57:02 -> 00:57:09]  Rydyn ni'n sylweddoli bod y dywedodd yma yn cael ymddygiad o'r holl hynny, felly rhaid i ni gofyn i unrhywun ysgrifennu amgylchedd yn gyflym,
[00:57:10 -> 00:57:15]  a gofyn iddyn nhw'n ymddygiadol i gael AED, felly rydyn ni'n cael un ymddygiad o'r holl hyn, er mwyn i'r person hwn ddweud.
[00:57:16 -> 00:57:23]  Felly mae'r amgylchedd yn ei ffordd, rydyn ni'n ceisio eu gallu eu gwneud yn ymddygiadol, ac rydw i'n mynd i weld a oes ganddyn nhw unrhyw ysgrifennu allweddol,
[00:57:24 -> 00:57:30]  felly 150-300mg o ysgrifennu allweddol, ac mae hynny'n gallu helpu i ddiddordeb y llwydd, a chyflawni'r broses.
[00:57:31 -> 00:57:36]  Rydw i'n mynd i'w leihau mewn yr ysgrifennu yw'r W, felly os ydych chi'n gallu fynd i fyny eich hysgrifennu, gosodwch nhw'n gilydd,
[00:57:37 -> 00:57:40]  a byddwn i'n cefnogi chi o'r ôl, gallwch chi edrych yn ôl ychydig.
[00:57:41 -> 00:57:43]  Yw hynny'n hyfforddiol? Ie.
[00:57:44 -> 00:57:48]  Felly rydw i'n mynd i'w gallu ei wneud yn ddiogel, os oes unrhyw ddangos cyffredin ar ôl y llwydd neu'r ysgrifennu, rydw i'n mynd i'w allu.
[00:57:49 -> 00:57:54]  Rydw i'n mynd i'w gallu ei wneud yn hyfforddi ac yn cefnogi nhw pan fydd yr ysgrifennu'n arwain.
[00:57:55 -> 00:57:57]  Y tredd yw'r ysgrifennu cardiac.
[00:57:58 -> 00:57:59]  Felly mae hyn yn wahanol i ddiddordeb llwydd.
[00:57:59 -> 00:58:02]  Mae'r ysgrifennu cardiac pan fydd yr ysgrifennu'n arwain.
[00:58:03 -> 00:58:07]  Felly, nid oes llwydd yng nghanol y bod.
[00:58:08 -> 00:58:17]  Felly, os yw hynny'n digwydd, byddwch chi'n gweld nhw'n cael eu lladio i'r fflwr, efallai'n mynd yn dda iawn i ddechrau gyda nhw cyn cael eu lladio a byddant yn dechrau ysgrifennu.
[00:58:18 -> 00:58:22]  Felly, wrth gwrs, mae angen i ni ddweud â'r ysgrifennu i ddod i'r AED a dechrau CPR yn gyflym.
[00:58:22 -> 00:58:27]  Mae'r fath ynto'n cyflym i'r agor ymhellach nad mod i'n ymwybod â rhoi ffwrdd iawn.
[00:58:28 -> 00:58:35]  Felly, rydw i'n mynd i'w ddeall trefnuoedd a gwella cyn cael rhwydwaith ac arian galluog na golygu hynny'n cyflymod.
[00:58:36 -> 00:58:38]  Yn tes consol.
[00:58:39 -> 00:58:41]  Rydw i'n mynd i'r Ddangosit.
[00:58:42 -> 00:58:46]  1. Camysghwn casgliad aro aquilo.
[00:58:46 -> 00:58:55]  yw'r test cyntaf yw'r ffach. Felly, mae eich fach yn edrych yn drwp, neu'n drwp ar un o bwrdd?
[00:58:55 -> 00:59:00]  I ddysgu hynny, gallwn ei gofyn a ydynt yn gallu ysmail a gweld a yw cyd-bwrddau'n gallu
[00:59:00 -> 00:59:07]  fynd i'r afan. A yw'r brif, felly gofyn iddyn nhw fynd i'r brif a phosib yw un ohonyn nhw'n
[00:59:07 -> 00:59:15]  cael eu strog. Yr hnes hwn yw S, felly yw'r sgwrs. Felly, yw'r sgwrs nhw'n normal, yw'n
[00:59:16 -> 00:59:21]  dweud pethau sy'n ddim yn gwneud syniad, neu efallai nad ydyn nhw'n gallu siarad gyda'i gilydd.
[00:59:21 -> 00:59:28]  Os ydych chi'n gweld unrhyw hynny, yna mae'n amser i T ddweud 999 yn gyflym fel sy'n bosibl.
[00:59:28 -> 00:59:36]  Felly, rwy'n mynd i ddangos i chi sut i wneud dwy ffordd o slingiau gwahanol nawr. Y cyntaf rwy'n mynd i
[00:59:36 -> 00:59:40]  ddangos i chi yw sling cymorth. Felly, yr hyn y gallwch chi ddefnyddio sling cymorth
[00:59:40 -> 00:59:48]  yw gysylltiad â'r llawer ysgafn, felly efallai ffractio, efallai gysylltiad â'r
[00:59:48 -> 00:59:52]  sgwrs neu'r llawer ysgafn, yn dybynnu ar yr hyn sy'n ymddygiadol iawn ar gyfer y casgliad,
[00:59:52 -> 00:59:58]  felly gallant eich ysgrifennu gyda hynny. Iawn? Felly, rwy'n mynd i ddangos i chi eich ysgafn fel hyn.
[01:00:01 -> 01:00:02]  Agorwch eich sling.
[01:00:02 -> 01:00:10]  Mae'r ddwy sling yn mynd i ddechrau yn yr un ffordd o ran y dyfodol o'r llawer. Felly, mae gennych
[01:00:10 -> 01:00:17]  rhan fawr o'r trianglau, ac yna mae gennych y pwynt sy'n mynd i'r gysylltiad â'r llawer
[01:00:17 -> 01:00:24]  ysgafn. Iawn? Felly, i'r sling cymorth, rydyn ni'n mynd i ddechrau o le i'r llawer, felly mae'r
[01:00:24 -> 01:00:31]  llawer ar y chest. Ac yna, rydyn ni'n mynd i ddefnyddio'r pwynt hwn i ddod o'r
[01:00:31 -> 01:00:39]  sefydlu... ac yna dwi'n mynd i'w dddwyo ung ar gwrs canfodol.
[01:00:40 -> 01:00:47]  dywedais defnyddio'r jôl mai oedd hwn, i mi o bryn, felly dywedais i mi, dwi'n gobeithio ein bod chi'n
[01:00:47 -> 01:00:51]  gyda gêm ac newydd ac basically, i gyd i chi ddewis.
[01:00:51 -> 01:00:59]  Dywedais i mi, mae'n mynd i'r gysylltiad â'r griio a hyd yn oed, pwyshech chi'r tri gu enw ac
[01:00:59 -> 01:01:01]  well supported yep?
[01:01:01 -> 01:01:02]  yep.
[01:01:02 -> 01:01:03]  Ok, great.
[01:01:03 -> 01:01:05]  So that is your support sling.
[01:01:05 -> 01:01:08]  Ok the second sling is the elevation sling,
[01:01:08 -> 01:01:10]  so if we just pop your arm up here.
[01:01:10 -> 01:01:17]  Ok so this might be for a bleed, a sprain or again maybe an injury to the shoulder
[01:01:17 -> 01:01:18]  or collar bone.
[01:01:18 -> 01:01:21]  It depends on how comfortable the casualty is and they usually will come to you in a
[01:01:21 -> 01:01:23]  position that is comfortable for them.
[01:01:23 -> 01:01:26]  Felly, y sling, eto, y rhan fawr o'r ddarn da i'r ddarn da
[01:01:26 -> 01:01:29]  a'r pwynt i'r gweithredd ar y ddarn ddau.
[01:01:29 -> 01:01:32]  Rydw i'n ei leihau'n ddiweddaru dros y top yma.
[01:01:32 -> 01:01:34]  Rydw i'n mynd i ddangos y rhan hwnnw i'ch ffinger
[01:01:34 -> 01:01:36]  a'i gefnogi i mi,
[01:01:36 -> 01:01:37]  er mwyn iddo ddangos.
[01:01:37 -> 01:01:40]  Rydw i'n mynd i gael y pwynt ar y ddarn
[01:01:40 -> 01:01:43]  a'i swipio ar y ddarn
[01:01:43 -> 01:01:48]  ac rydw i'n mynd i ddangos y ddarn o'r casuality.
[01:01:48 -> 01:01:49]  Rydw i'n mynd i'w ddangos ychydig yn fawr
[01:01:50 -> 01:01:50]  ac weekend llwyr yn amlenni,
[01:01:50 -> 01:01:53]  Licio'r gorff orau sydd ar y target
[01:01:53 -> 01:01:55]  sydd ar y bach hon oherwydd ar yr gin.
[01:01:59 -> 01:02:02]  A dwi'n mynd, eto, rhoi bobl tŷ

[01:02:05 -> 01:02:06]  hyd yn heb un,
[01:02:06 -> 01:02:09]  rhai o'n sylwiadau.
[01:02:10 -> 01:02:12]  Gallwch dŷ hymny wastudio poki a'r cefn gaff.
[01:02:12 -> 01:02:13]  Mae'n sefeldib?
[01:02:13 -> 01:02:15]  Iawn, deall.

[01:02:17 -> 01:02:24]  i ymgyrchu, i ymgyrchu, i ymgyrchu a i ymgyrchu.
[01:02:24 -> 01:02:28]  Os ydych chi'n meddwl bod y fraction, os yw'n fraction glan, felly nid yw'r gynllun wedi'i
[01:02:28 -> 01:02:34]  ymgyrchu drwy'r dŵr, yna byddwch chi'n cymryd ymgyrchu a'r cefnogaeth yn y
[01:02:34 -> 01:02:38]  sefydliad sydd wedi'i ddod, er mwyn eu gwneud nhw'n ymddygiadol, ac yn ymgyrchu
[01:02:38 -> 01:02:39]  999.
[01:02:39 -> 01:02:44]  Os yw'n fraction agored, gwneud ymgyrchu gyda'r blaen, onid yw'n cymryd ymgyrchu
[01:02:44 -> 01:02:47]  fel y byddwch chi'n ei wneud, ac eto, dim ond cymryd ymgyrchu a'r cefnogaeth a'r
