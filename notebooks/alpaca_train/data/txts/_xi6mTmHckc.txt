[00:00:00 -> 00:00:11]  Now that we have completed the mapping of the body, we will now begin our journey through
[00:00:11 -> 00:00:16]  each of the body's systems, of which there are 12.
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:19]  Our first journey begins with the Antegumentary System.
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:33]  This body system is divided into three major parts, the skin, the hair, and the nails.
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:39]  This system is known as a membrane because it covers the body, and an organ because it
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:41]  contains several tissues.
[00:00:41 -> 00:00:46]  For the purposes of this course, this system will be described as an organ with a variety
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:49]  of essential tissues.
[00:00:49 -> 00:01:00]  The skin is composed by three main layers, epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis.
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:04]  The epidermis is the outermost layer of skin.
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:09]  This layer is further divided into five to six thinner layers which do not have blood
[00:01:09 -> 00:01:10]  vessels.
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:16]  Only two of these layers of the skin will be described.
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:18]  Stratum Corneum.
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:23]  This is the uppermost layer of the skin which constantly sheds, or where the dead skin cells
[00:01:23 -> 00:01:25]  are sloughed off.
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:31]  Essentially, the top layer of the skin is composed of dead cells.
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:34]  Stratum Germinatibum.
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:40]  The Stratum Germinatibum is the lowest layer of the epidermis, and is in contact with the
[00:01:40 -> 00:01:41]  dermis below.
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:47]  It is the layer in which cell division called mitosis takes place, and where new epidermal
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:52]  tissue is formed and begins to migrate to the surface of the skin, replacing the dead
[00:01:52 -> 00:01:59]  skin cells found in the Stratum Corneum.
[00:01:59 -> 00:02:04]  Dermis also known as the Corium or the True Skin.
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:10]  This layer contains major structures and functions for the skin within a framework of elastic
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:12]  connective tissue.
[00:02:12 -> 00:02:15]  This is where the skin comes to life.
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:25]  Contained within the dermis are the blood vessels, nerves, involuntary muscles, sweat
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:34]  glands, oil glands, hair follicles, and the papilla.
[00:02:34 -> 00:02:35]  Blood Vessels.
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:43]  Via the capillaries, nutrients are provided to the skin and waste products are taken away.
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:48]  These blood vessels also play a major part in maintaining and sustaining the body's
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:51]  temperature for optimal functioning.
[00:02:51 -> 00:03:01]  The vessels dilate to release heat or they constrict in order to retain the body's heat.
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:05]  Nerves allow the skin to have sensory perception.
[00:03:05 -> 00:03:12]  Through the skin, the body is able to respond to pain, pressure, temperature, as well as
[00:03:12 -> 00:03:17]  touch sensations.
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:21]  Involuntary muscles in the dermis control functions such as lifting hair or opening
[00:03:21 -> 00:03:23]  pores.
[00:03:23 -> 00:03:28]  By dilating or opening the pores in the skin, the body is able to cool off and allow sweat
[00:03:28 -> 00:03:31]  to exit.
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:36]  When the body needs to keep its temperature up to prevent heat loss, these muscles allow
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:41]  the pores in the skin to contract or constrict in order to keep the heat from exiting the
[00:03:41 -> 00:03:42]  body.
[00:03:42 -> 00:03:48]  In fact, if it's too cold, these pores can constrict so tightly that they form what is
[00:03:48 -> 00:03:51]  known as goose bumps.
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:55]  These structures are important for keeping and maintaining the body's temperature, which
[00:03:55 -> 00:03:59]  averages at 98.6 degrees.
[00:03:59 -> 00:04:03]  This helps maintain the process of homeostasis.
[00:04:03 -> 00:04:08]  Homeostasis is a major process by which the body works to keep all of its structures and
[00:04:08 -> 00:04:10]  functions in balance.
[00:04:10 -> 00:04:17]  Another way of saying it would be to keep the body healthy.
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:23]  Sweat glands, or pseudoriferous glands, are coiled tubes that extend through the dermis
[00:04:23 -> 00:04:27]  and open on the surface of the skin at the pores.
[00:04:27 -> 00:04:34]  The sweat, or perspiration, eliminated by these glands contain water, salt, and some
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:39]  body wastes.
[00:04:39 -> 00:04:45]  Oil, or sebaceous glands, usually open onto hair follicles.
[00:04:45 -> 00:04:51]  These glands produce sebum, an oil that keeps the skin and hair from becoming dry.
[00:04:51 -> 00:04:56]  However, due to genetics, some people's hair is more dry than others.
[00:04:56 -> 00:05:00]  The dryness is determined by whether or not the hair is curly.
[00:05:00 -> 00:05:06]  The curlier the hair, the drier the hair, even when the amount of sebum produced is
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:09]  the same.
[00:05:09 -> 00:05:15]  A hair follicle anchors each hair into the skin, deep into the dermis.
[00:05:15 -> 00:05:18]  The hair bulb forms the base of the hair follicle.
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:24]  In the hair bulb, living cells divide and grow to build the hair shaft.
[00:05:24 -> 00:05:30]  The hair shaft is the hair that projects from the skin or scalp.
[00:05:30 -> 00:05:35]  Papilla The top of the dermis is covered with papilla,
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:40]  which fits into the ridges right below the stratum germinovatum.
[00:05:40 -> 00:05:45]  The papilla are responsible for creating fingerprints and footprints.
[00:05:45 -> 00:05:53]  Like a snowflake, no one fingerprint is created twice, not even in twins.
[00:05:53 -> 00:06:00]  Subcutaneous fascia or hypodermis This structure is located below the dermis,
[00:06:00 -> 00:06:03]  or the bottom of the innermost layer of the skin.
[00:06:03 -> 00:06:10]  It is made of elastic and fibrous connective tissue and adipose, which is fatty tissue.
[00:06:10 -> 00:06:15]  The purpose for this layer is to connect the skin to the underlying muscles.
[00:06:15 -> 00:06:21]  Adipose, or fat, is the yellowish section found in this layer.
[00:06:21 -> 00:06:25]  We can compare our skin to a piece of cake.
[00:06:25 -> 00:06:27]  Epidermis is the frosting.
[00:06:27 -> 00:06:35]  The dermis is the cake itself, and the subcutaneous, or hypodermis, is the bottom of the cake connecting
[00:06:35 -> 00:06:38]  to the pan.
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:43]  The hair is the second major part of the integumentary system.
[00:06:43 -> 00:06:48]  The hair's main function is to protect the skin.
[00:06:48 -> 00:06:52]  Hair is composed of a strong, structural protein called keratin.
[00:06:52 -> 00:06:56]  The hair grows within a hollow tube called the follicle.
[00:06:56 -> 00:06:59]  Here's a little hair trivia for you.
[00:06:59 -> 00:07:03]  Hair can be shaved, cut, styled, and groomed.
[00:07:03 -> 00:07:05]  But why doesn't it hurt when you cut your hair?
[00:07:05 -> 00:07:10]  The answer is, it doesn't hurt when the hair is cut because there are no nerves.
[00:07:10 -> 00:07:15]  But then why does it hurt when you pluck your eyebrow or pull a hair out of the scalp?
[00:07:15 -> 00:07:19]  That's because at the base of the hair follicle are sensory nerve fibers that wrap around
[00:07:19 -> 00:07:22]  each hair bulb.
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:28]  Alright, the third major part of the integumentary system is the nail.
[00:07:28 -> 00:07:34]  The nail's main function is to serve the fingers and toes as protective plates and enhance
[00:07:34 -> 00:07:38]  the sensation of the fingertip or the toe tip.
[00:07:38 -> 00:07:43]  Like the hair, the nail is also composed of keratin.
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:50]  Primarily, the nail is made up of dead epithelial cells packed tightly together to form a translucent,
[00:07:50 -> 00:07:55]  thick, dense surface of keratin.
[00:07:55 -> 00:07:58]  The nail is formed in the nail bed.
[00:07:58 -> 00:08:02]  If you slam your finger in the door, you may lose a nail, but it will regrow.
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:10]  If you damage the nail bed, however, that nail will never come back.
[00:08:10 -> 00:08:15]  Before we conclude part one of the integumentary system, let's review.
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:23]  There are three main parts to this body system, the skin, the hair, and the nails.
[00:08:23 -> 00:08:32]  And the skin has three main layers, the epidermis, which is the outermost layer, the dermis,
[00:08:32 -> 00:08:37]  which is just below the epidermis, and contains major structures and functions for the skin
[00:08:37 -> 00:08:42]  within a framework of elastic connective tissue.
[00:08:42 -> 00:08:50]  And third, the subcutaneous fascia, or hypodermis, which is the innermost layer.
[00:08:50 -> 00:08:56]  Next, we covered the hair, whose main function is to protect the skin.
[00:08:56 -> 00:09:02]  And the third major part of the integumentary system is the nails, which serve the fingers
[00:09:02 -> 00:09:09]  and toes as protective plates and enhance the sensation of fingertip or toe tip.
[00:09:09 -> 00:09:14]  In our next video, we will be covering the functions of the integumentary system.
[00:09:14 -> 00:09:16]  Thanks for watching, and we'll see you again in part two.
