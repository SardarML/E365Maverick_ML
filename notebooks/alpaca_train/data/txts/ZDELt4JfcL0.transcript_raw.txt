 Hi my name is Myles and in this video we're going to explore how to shoot a real estate video.  Hi my name is Myles and in this video we're going to explore how to shoot a real estate video.  Lumos which helps me this you can direct that in the sky and it'll tell you where  the Sun is and where it's going to be at a certain point in time and you can try  and work out which areas of the house you want to shoot at first if you really  want to avoid blowing out the windows my personal view is that some windows are  going to blow out and you're not going to have flexibility all the time in  terms of the areas that you're shooting in the time of day etc I don't think  it's a cardinal sin to have windows blown out and for the lower budget jobs  I wouldn't worry too much about it on the bigger budget ones these are the  types of things that you can consider have a think about how you can best show  off the rooms best angles to get and what camera movement to do as you're  walking in or walking around it and keep an eye out for those details that you  might want some detailed shots of later so with all that in mind you're going to  plan your route round you're going to want to cover the externals to get all  the property from the outside any garden any kind of external features in the  area that you want to get then I would do one pass of the interior on my gimbal  with my super wide and then I'll do another pass going for the detail shots  maybe on a separate lens so for me I like a 25 mil which is a 50 mil full  frame equivalent to get those detail shots and get some shallow depth of field  obviously if you're working with a lower budget and you're doing a higher volume  of a real estate walkthroughs then you might not want to do that second pass  for the details you just want to agree with the estate agents what you'll do up  front and then get around the house in the order that makes the most sense to  you so if you've got that odd room which is really too dark to film with your  camera you've bumped the ISO you've dropped the aperture as much as you can  you've dropped the shutter speed even as much as you can if it's still too dark  then that's when you could consider lighting if the budget permits so I  would try and bounce that off the ceiling or off the wall away from the  actual camera so that it fills the room with some light and just make sure it  doesn't look really unnatural on camera if you are able to bounce off a large  area of wall or ceiling and that's going to give you a softer light it'll almost  act like the walls and ceiling are the source of the light and that will give  you a really softer shadows and everything which is probably going to be  the best look lastly unfortunately you're going to have to consider whether  you need to tidy anything up and that's ultimately going to help the property  sell so that's it you've had a look around you've got your shot list of  things that you know you need to cover you know what angles are going to look  the best and you know which order you're going to do all the rooms now you're  getting ready to shoot so here I would suggest first of all that while you're  dialing in the exposure to get the room right you also want to look at the white  balance on your camera for every room or changing light condition that you're  going to face I personally try and avoid using auto white balance because at least  on the GH5 auto white balance will actually change the white balance mid  shot so if you've got some elements moving through your scene it might  actually change white balance and look really weird so I would rather use a  fixed preset or set it using a grey card failing that dial in a custom Kelvin  value on the camera itself on the gimbal shots I'm going to use any one of four  main type of gimbal moves that's a straightforward walking push in or a  dolly sometimes I've got an interesting floor or ceiling I'm going to do the  same thing but add a tilt in there as well sometimes I'll pan with the gimbal  and I'll combine that with a walk to give you a smooth arc through a room and  as mentioned earlier I replicate a slider using the gimbal to that looks  especially good if you've got a foreground or background object object  which is moving through the frame to give you a nice parallax action if I'm  filming detail shots then I might be doing them on a gimbal although the GH5  body stabilization is so good I might even do those handheld if I'm gonna go  handheld personally I like to flip it to a hundred frames a second just so it's  still really smooth small details are like an orbit shot which is just where  you point inwards at the object and move your camera around otherwise you might  tilt the camera or do a little dolly push in and sometimes it's nice to mix  it up by combining these moves in this case my detail is gonna look quite dark  cuz I'm shooting into the Sun but you get the idea first when it comes to the  gimbal or even any handheld movements I'm gonna try and keep it smooth and  steady the whole way don't like to turn the gimbal too much either I'm looking  for one smooth movement in each shot I'm doing each room by room and I'm gonna  enter through the doorway maybe just so I've got some foreground going in front  of the frame and then I'm gonna try and execute one slow movement with the  gimbal it's gonna look really slow and really professional if you can just get  in one smooth movement to show off the best of the room in one go then I would  cut to another angle if the room is really nice and you've got another angle  you want to show off rather than try and get it all in one continuous shot now  that's not a rule obviously if you've got an epic space and you really want to  show it off these rules are all made to be broken but I would avoid speed  ramping too much in post because it can look a bit silly to my eye shooting with  the camera about here on the gimbal is a bit more attractive than filming at eye  level unless the space is really big and you've got quite high ceilings as I  mentioned I'm always looking for foreground objects that I can have go  past the camera and that can sometimes give you interesting options for  transitions in post and just bear in mind if you are shooting a handheld just  to try and keep your movement smaller you don't want to be trying to walk with  the camera and hope to get a smooth result because that's probably not going  to happen and I'm not gonna move my legs much in that situation I'm gonna try and  move my body and keep my arms tucked in and quite rigid and try and get the  camera movement just by swaying my body and moving whatever needs to be moved so  that's it once you've gone through your shot list you've gone through all the  rooms that you need to you've got all the perspectives and all the spaces that  you want you've shot them wide and you might have got some detailed shots if  you've got the time and budget you've got your exteriors you should have some  awesome looking footage to work with then in post speaking of post if you  want to see a video on how I would edit a real estate video then please let me  know by leaving a like or a comment and if I get enough no pressure then I'll  release a video covering that topic next thanks for watching this one please  leave any tips you've got that I might have missed below or otherwise you're  going to shout at me do it down there and I'll see you in the next one
