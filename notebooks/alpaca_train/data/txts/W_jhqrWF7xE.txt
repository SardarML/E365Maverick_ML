[00:00:00 -> 00:00:05]  So hi, hello and welcome, MicrobeHunter here, and today in this video I want to show you
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:08]  a few cells from mammals.
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:13]  Like for example, we humans are of course also mammals, but specifically I want to answer
[00:00:13 -> 00:00:19]  the question why is it possible, or rather how is it possible, that even though the cells
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:24]  of a human being, even though they have the same DNA, so all of my cells have pretty much
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:29]  the same DNA, why is it still possible that the cells look so different and do so many
[00:00:29 -> 00:00:30]  different tasks?
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:37]  Well, if the DNA controls the cells, and if the DNA is the genetic information that controls
[00:00:37 -> 00:00:43]  the cells, and if all of the cells have the same DNA, then why are the cells so different?
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:47]  That's a very interesting question, and at the end of the video I would like to also
[00:00:47 -> 00:00:53]  talk about one of the big unsolved mysteries of biology, and of course this topic also
[00:00:53 -> 00:00:57]  relates to the cells that I would like to show you today.
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:00]  Well, first of all, what do we see here in the background?
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:05]  This is the cross-section of a kidney, and if you look very carefully, then you're able
[00:01:05 -> 00:01:10]  to see the individual cells here, and those dark red dots that you see here, these are
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:16]  the nuclei of the cells, so this is of course a specimen that has been stained, and those
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:21]  white circles over here, these are tubules where urine is being produced, so the kidney
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:28]  is there to filter the blood and to remove waste products, among other things, and there
[00:01:28 -> 00:01:34]  are many, many of these tiny tubules in the kidney, and here this is the cross-section,
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:38]  and let's remember very carefully how the cells here look like.
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:42]  I would like to show you now the cells of muscle, and you're going to see that they
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:44]  look very different.
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:49]  So this here is now skeletal muscle, or also known as striated muscle, and these are very
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:51]  long muscle fibers.
[00:01:51 -> 00:01:56]  By the way, this is the same magnification, I'm using now my 60x magnifying objective,
[00:01:56 -> 00:02:00]  and one of the very typical things is, look at those tiny stripes that you see here, those
[00:02:00 -> 00:02:08]  narrow horizontal lines, this gives the muscle a name, these are so-called striations, and
[00:02:08 -> 00:02:12]  these are the so-called light and the dark bands, and they are there because these are
[00:02:12 -> 00:02:16]  protein fibers there that cause the muscle to contract.
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:22]  And for our purposes, what I think is important is simply to appreciate that the cells of
[00:02:22 -> 00:02:28]  muscle look very different, obviously, and that they perform, of course, a very different
[00:02:28 -> 00:02:34]  function, but still, they have the same DNA as all of the other body cells, and here,
[00:02:34 -> 00:02:37]  for example, you can see the striations quite well.
[00:02:37 -> 00:02:39]  And again, why is that?
[00:02:39 -> 00:02:44]  How can it be possible that even though muscle cells have the same DNA as the kidney cells
[00:02:44 -> 00:02:48]  that we've just seen, how is it still possible that they look so different?
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:51]  Okay, I'm going to show you now the next slide.
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:56]  So let's get it a little bit into focus over here, okay, now here we go.
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:02]  Look at those dark structures over here, I mean, these are so-called osteocytes and we're
[00:03:02 -> 00:03:09]  looking right now at bone, this is bone tissue, compact bone, and those dark dots here, these
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:17]  are the bone cells that are able to not only make bone, but also break down bone and rearrange
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:18]  the bone.
[00:03:18 -> 00:03:24]  And these osteocytes, they can last for a very long time, I have read somewhere that
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:30]  they can survive many, many decades, so 25 years and even longer.
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:35]  So you can see that, yeah, there are quite a few of them here, and they again look very
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:40]  different and they perform, again, very different tasks, but do I have to repeat myself now
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:41]  or not?
[00:03:41 -> 00:03:47]  They contain, again, the same DNA as the other cells, as the muscle cells and the kidney
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:49]  cells that we've seen, okay?
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:52]  Still they look very different and perform different functions.
[00:03:52 -> 00:03:55]  How is this possible, okay?
[00:03:55 -> 00:03:56]  How is this possible?
[00:03:56 -> 00:03:59]  But don't worry, the answer will come after the next slide.
[00:03:59 -> 00:04:07]  This here is a cross-section through the scalp, the scalp is the skin of the head,
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:11]  and here again we're able to see quite nicely the different dots here, all of these dots
[00:04:11 -> 00:04:16]  are the different cells, and you can see over here, this here is the surface of the skin
[00:04:16 -> 00:04:24]  and you can see that the top layer of the skin cells starts to shed off here.
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:29]  But those cells of the scalp, yeah, of course, I don't know if we're able to find it, there
[00:04:29 -> 00:04:35]  are some fat tissues in here, but if we're able to, if we're a little bit lucky, we might
[00:04:35 -> 00:04:37]  actually also see the formation of hair.
[00:04:37 -> 00:04:44]  Wow, look at this, there are again some huge cells over here, and look at this here, this
[00:04:44 -> 00:04:47]  seems to be the place where hair is made, okay?
[00:04:47 -> 00:04:53]  And this red thing that you see over here, this is actually a little part of hair which
[00:04:53 -> 00:04:58]  is being formed, so the cells around here that you see, they are responsible for making
[00:04:58 -> 00:05:00]  the hair protein.
[00:05:00 -> 00:05:07]  Again, very different shape, function, and sizes, and you have again different tissues
[00:05:07 -> 00:05:12]  over here, I don't know, maybe also fat tissues for fat storage in the skin, of course, very
[00:05:12 -> 00:05:13]  important.
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:22]  We've got some muscles that are able to pull on the hair and to rise the hair even, so
[00:05:22 -> 00:05:26]  that sometimes, especially when you're cold, then you might be able to notice that some
[00:05:26 -> 00:05:31]  of the hair, especially on your hands, they start to stand up, so there are muscles involved
[00:05:31 -> 00:05:33]  here that basically pull the hair up.
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:40]  So there are quite a few structural adaptations here, and yeah, all of those cells have the
[00:05:40 -> 00:05:41]  same DNA.
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:47]  I think I need to answer now the question of how this is possible, that even though
[00:05:47 -> 00:05:51]  the DNA is the same, that the cells perform different functions, and the thing is the
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:57]  following is that the cells, even though they have the same DNA, not all of the DNA
[00:05:57 -> 00:06:02]  is actually also used, and what we biologists say, expressed.
[00:06:02 -> 00:06:07]  The purpose of DNA is to code for proteins, there are many, many different proteins in
[00:06:07 -> 00:06:14]  a human body, in human cells, and those proteins are the structures that actually do the tasks,
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:16]  they actually do the work in a cell.
[00:06:16 -> 00:06:22]  And how to make those proteins, this information is stored in the DNA of the cells, however
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:28]  not all of the DNA is always needed, and to give you an example, my skin cells, they contain
[00:06:28 -> 00:06:33]  of course also the DNA how to digest food, even though their responsibility is not to
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:38]  digest food, they still carry this DNA, but this DNA is not used.
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:42]  It's packaged away, and it is not active.
[00:06:42 -> 00:06:47]  And different cells have different parts of the DNA that are active, and therefore the
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:51]  different cells are able to make different proteins, and therefore they are able to do
[00:06:51 -> 00:06:53]  different tasks.
[00:06:53 -> 00:06:59]  And this is basically the answer to this mystery, how is it possible to have so many different
[00:06:59 -> 00:07:00]  cells.
[00:07:00 -> 00:07:06]  At the beginning, when we were all a fertilized egg cell, a zygote, but those very basic cells
[00:07:06 -> 00:07:10]  had the potential to make other cell types.
[00:07:10 -> 00:07:15]  And those cells that you see here are so-called differentiated cells, differentiated skin
[00:07:15 -> 00:07:21]  cells, and they do not have the possibility to form different cell types anymore, because
[00:07:21 -> 00:07:23]  they are already skin cells.
[00:07:23 -> 00:07:29]  And the cells are already differentiated, and part of the DNA that is not used is packaged
[00:07:29 -> 00:07:34]  away, and therefore it is not possible to convert those skin cells now to, I don't know,
[00:07:34 -> 00:07:36]  other cell types that we have seen.
[00:07:36 -> 00:07:41]  At least, this is not possible naturally, but let me assure you that scientists are
[00:07:41 -> 00:07:44]  working on this possibility as well.
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:48]  But I would like to now talk a little bit about this big unsolved mystery, or still
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:54]  the scientific problem that we still have in biology, and that is the following.
[00:07:54 -> 00:08:01]  Even though the information is stored on the DNA, on how the different cell types and the
[00:08:01 -> 00:08:08]  different tissue types, it is where exactly on the DNA is the information coded how I
[00:08:08 -> 00:08:11]  as a person should look like anatomically.
[00:08:11 -> 00:08:15]  So for example, where in the DNA are we able to find the information that I have to have
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:20]  one nose here, two eyes, a mouth?
[00:08:20 -> 00:08:22]  Where can you find this information?
[00:08:22 -> 00:08:26]  It is stored on the DNA, but it is not possible to locate it.
[00:08:26 -> 00:08:35]  So the question of morphogenesis, as it's called, of how to make a living multicellular
[00:08:35 -> 00:08:40]  organism, this information, even though it is stored on the DNA, we don't know where
[00:08:40 -> 00:08:41]  it is exactly.
[00:08:41 -> 00:08:44]  I mean, it is stored a little bit, as I would say, between the lines.
[00:08:44 -> 00:08:52]  It's what we biologists call an emergent property, where certain features and properties appear
[00:08:52 -> 00:08:56]  out of the interaction of many, many different parts.
[00:08:56 -> 00:09:03]  And for this reason, how you have all of this information stored in the DNA is still one
[00:09:03 -> 00:09:07]  of the biggest mysteries in biology.
[00:09:07 -> 00:09:14]  So if I give you a piece of DNA, or the DNA of an organism, and I ask you how does the
[00:09:14 -> 00:09:20]  organism look like, then you're not able to read it out of the DNA directly.
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:27]  So you have to actually let the cell divide and let the organism form and develop until
[00:09:27 -> 00:09:30]  you're able to see how it actually looks like.
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:33]  But you're not able to read it directly out of the DNA.
[00:09:33 -> 00:09:36]  That's still one of the unsolved mysteries here.
[00:09:36 -> 00:09:41]  Well, yeah, as we look through all of those cells that I showed you right now, I have
[00:09:41 -> 00:09:47]  to tell you I'm always very fascinated by the complexity of nature and the complexity
[00:09:47 -> 00:09:48]  of life.
[00:09:48 -> 00:09:49]  So I hope that you liked the video.
