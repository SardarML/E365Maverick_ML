[00:00:00 -> 00:00:07]  This video is the first in a two-part series that looks at how a free particle moves in
[00:00:07 -> 00:00:14]  the region outside an uncharged rotating black hole described by the Kerr metric.
[00:00:14 -> 00:00:19]  The first, this first video derives the equations of the geodesics for the time t and azimuthal
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:22]  angle phi coordinates.
[00:00:22 -> 00:00:28]  It uses the Lagrangian method.
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:33]  Now we can find the equations of the geodesics of free particles in the Kerr geometry using
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:39]  the Euler-Lagrange equations and that will be the focus of this and the next video.
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:44]  Now our aim is to find the form of the equations for the t dot, r dot, theta dot and phi dot
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:45]  coordinates.
[00:00:45 -> 00:00:52]  So we're describing this path in terms of the coordinates t, r, theta and phi.
[00:00:52 -> 00:01:00]  t will be scaled to be ct and those coordinates will be parameterized in terms of an affine
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:04]  parameter lambda.
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:08]  For a particle with mass that parameter lambda would be the proper time but for a massless
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:15]  particle we can't use proper time so we use a generalized affine parameter lambda.
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:18]  The situation is we're going to have a rotating source mass.
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:24]  This oblates phoroidal shape, dilated, bulging in the equatorial direction so dilated away
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:33]  from the axis of rotation in the equatorial plane, in the equatorial plane direction.
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:41]  And as I said it will be parameterized in terms of lambda.
[00:01:41 -> 00:01:47]  Tangent to these geodesics is the 4-velocity of the particle and throughout these two videos
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:50]  we'll work with the 4-velocity and the 4-momentum.
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:57]  Now both the 4-velocity and the 4-momentum are tangent to the geodesics at all points.
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:03]  So the 4-momentum vector and the 4-velocity vector are tangent.
[00:02:03 -> 00:02:09]  In terms of the 4-velocity we have ct dot, r dot, theta dot, phi dot as the coordinates
[00:02:09 -> 00:02:18]  and the magnitude of this vector for a particle with mass will be minus c squared.
[00:02:18 -> 00:02:24]  Now the magnitude is the 4-velocity vector dotted with itself, the scalar or inner product
[00:02:24 -> 00:02:31]  of the vector gives us minus c squared and that will be the total derivative dx mu, the
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:35]  coordinates with respect to the parameter lambda.
[00:02:35 -> 00:02:41]  So x dot mu, the dot will stand for dx mu d lambda, so it's differentiating the coordinates
[00:02:41 -> 00:02:42]  with respect to lambda.
[00:02:42 -> 00:02:48]  So each dot will be differentiating with respect to lambda, so two dots will be the second
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:51]  derivative with respect to lambda.
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:57]  Coming back to the 4-momentum of the particle, its magnitude, the 4-momentum vector is tangent
[00:02:57 -> 00:03:02]  to the geodesics followed by the particle, the free particle.
[00:03:02 -> 00:03:09]  And that is equal to that magnitude of the 4-momentum vector with itself, the inner product,
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:17]  the scalar product, is p dot p will be minus m squared c squared.
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:24]  The minus m squared c squared for the 4-momentum inner product and for the 4-velocity inner
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:30]  product is minus c squared and the reason it's minus because on this channel I always
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:38]  use the metric minus 1 plus plus plus, so I use an overall positive metric with the
[00:03:38 -> 00:03:43]  zero component having a negative, being negative.
[00:03:43 -> 00:03:53]  Other textbooks, other sources will also use the opposite metric where you have plus minus
[00:03:53 -> 00:03:54]  minus minus.
[00:03:55 -> 00:04:00]  Okay, so now our form is defined, our aim is to find the form of the equations for the
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:05]  t dot r dot theta and phi dot coordinates, okay, which gives us the 4-velocity of the
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:11]  particle and we can also use to get the 4-momentum as you'll see when we go on.
[00:04:11 -> 00:04:15]  So our rotating source mass creates a space time around it, the metric, the curve metric,
[00:04:15 -> 00:04:21]  this is the line element but within it is the metric but anyway it's often called the
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:25]  metric but it's actually the line element, so ds squared is this object here, so it's
[00:04:25 -> 00:04:29]  the line element or space time interval, it's this object here.
[00:04:29 -> 00:04:34]  Now the curve geometry is not spherically symmetric like the Schwarzschild case due
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:41]  to the frame dragging effect and the dilation in the equatorial plane due to rotation.
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:46]  So in the Schwarzschild case we had a spherical shape, this one is oblate spheroidal because
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:52]  of the rotation, so it bulges in the direction of the equatorial plane, okay, it dilates
[00:04:52 -> 00:04:54]  away from the rotation axis.
[00:04:54 -> 00:05:03]  So for those two reasons there you have a geometry that's not spherically symmetric.
[00:05:03 -> 00:05:10]  Now that has some implications, so that means that purely radial paths for test particles
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:16]  are not possible, meaning that the total angular momentum of these particles is not conserved.
[00:05:16 -> 00:05:21]  But in the Schwarzschild case we could have particles that came in on purely radial trajectories
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:25]  because this was a sphere, it was symmetrical in all ways.
[00:05:25 -> 00:05:29]  It also meant that in the Schwarzschild case you could have motion confined to a single
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:34]  plane and that plane could be rotated about the centre of the sphere there in any way
[00:05:34 -> 00:05:36]  you liked.
[00:05:36 -> 00:05:43]  The high degree of spherical symmetry meant that radial paths were possible but in this
[00:05:43 -> 00:05:45]  case we don't have spherical symmetry.
[00:05:45 -> 00:05:53]  You have the start, the source mass is not a sphere, it bulges in the equatorial plane
[00:05:53 -> 00:06:02]  so it's dilated away from the, flattened in a direction away from the rotation axis.
[00:06:02 -> 00:06:09]  And you have the frame dragging effect also which means that angular momentum cannot be
[00:06:09 -> 00:06:16]  conserved, the total angular momentum cannot be conserved and no purely radial paths are
[00:06:16 -> 00:06:17]  possible.
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:18]  Okay.
[00:06:18 -> 00:06:21]  We'll just come back to that, we'll pursue that a little bit more.
[00:06:21 -> 00:06:26]  So no particle can travel on a purely radial path due to the dragging of the inertial frames
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:30]  effect and so the particle's trajectory is affected such that its angular velocity is
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:38]  its phi component momentum, for momentum over its time component or gt phi on gtt is equal
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:44]  to the angular velocity which is a function of r and theta.
[00:06:44 -> 00:06:50]  So a particle of mass m must as it moves in towards the rotating source mass it must rotate
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:51]  with the source mass.
[00:06:51 -> 00:06:57]  Now all of that, this equation here is all part of the Kerr metric video series so please
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:01]  go have a look at that but I'm just quoting that result from here to show you that with
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:06]  the frame dragging any particle coming in must rotate as it moves towards the source
[00:07:06 -> 00:07:13]  must rotate with the source and okay must co-rotate with the source you can't rotate
[00:07:13 -> 00:07:21]  against it and so that twists paths out of the purely radial into other other directions.
[00:07:21 -> 00:07:25]  So a free particle travels along geodesics just reminding everyone of that free particle.
[00:07:25 -> 00:07:33]  Now by fixing r and theta notice the angular velocity here can be held constant if r and
[00:07:33 -> 00:07:39]  theta are fixed can have now by fixing r and theta the free particle can have constant
[00:07:39 -> 00:07:44]  angular momentum by moving along some geodesic in the phi direction.
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:51]  So as long as it's moving in the phi direction okay that's this way around the anticlockwise
[00:07:51 -> 00:08:00]  way as long as it's moving in the phi direction it can have constant angular momentum for
[00:08:00 -> 00:08:02]  that component.
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:07]  So I'll just build on that shortly we'll just come here I'll deal with that in a minute
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:13]  but the Kerr geometry is stationary and axisymmetric so a stationary spacetime is one for which
[00:08:13 -> 00:08:18]  all the components of the metric geomini are independent of t this means the spacetime
[00:08:18 -> 00:08:22]  outside the mass does not change over time so the partial derivative of the metric with
[00:08:22 -> 00:08:27]  respect to time component is zero and that implies that in this direction in the direction
[00:08:27 -> 00:08:34]  of the time coordinate we have a Killing vector K which is K T E T or for physicists
[00:08:34 -> 00:08:40]  vector basis form here or the differential operator for those with more of a differential
[00:08:40 -> 00:08:44]  geometry leaning both meaning the same thing anyway.
[00:08:44 -> 00:08:51]  An axially symmetric spacetime is one for which the components of the metric geomini
[00:08:51 -> 00:08:57]  are independent of the angle involved which in this case is phi so this means the component
[00:08:57 -> 00:09:05]  of the angular momentum P phi in the direction the rotation axis is conserved so the spacetime
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:12]  outside the mass does not change when moving in that phi direction okay so that component
[00:09:12 -> 00:09:20]  of angular momentum is conserved but the total angular momentum also involves the theta component
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:29]  and the other coordinates and that's not conserved but the purely angular momentum
[00:09:29 -> 00:09:35]  component P phi is conserved okay as long as you fix R and theta.
[00:09:35 -> 00:09:39]  So the partial derivative of the metric with respect to phi is zero so there's another
[00:09:39 -> 00:09:46]  Killing vector in the direction the phi direction so component K phi basis vector E phi or K
[00:09:46 -> 00:09:57]  phi and partial derivative of operator D phi okay so we wish to find the equations
[00:09:57 -> 00:10:01]  of the geodesics followed by a free particle of mass M whose coordinates are given by X
[00:10:01 -> 00:10:09]  mu equals X mu of lambda parameter lambda for a particle of mass best to use the proper
[00:10:09 -> 00:10:13]  time but here I'm going to keep it general so that we can refer to photons and massless
[00:10:13 -> 00:10:20]  particles in general now X mu of lambda is Ct of lambda R of lambda theta of lambda
[00:10:20 -> 00:10:24]  phi of lambda so they're all parameterized in terms of this parameter lambda now these
[00:10:24 -> 00:10:29]  geodesics of tangent vectors U mu is the X mu to lambda is X dot mu so that's the notation
[00:10:29 -> 00:10:36]  being used now for a free particle we can use the Euler Lagrange equations to derive
[00:10:36 -> 00:10:42]  the form of the geodesic for some Lagrangian L is T minus V and for a free particle the
[00:10:42 -> 00:10:49]  Lagrangian is simply equal to the kinetic energy term there's no potential this is particle
[00:10:49 -> 00:10:56]  has no net forces acting on it so it's it's not acting within any potential there's no
[00:10:56 -> 00:11:02]  net forces on this so it's a free particle in the Newtonian case a free particle just
[00:11:02 -> 00:11:07]  continues moving in a straight line remains at rest or moves at a constant speed or constant
[00:11:07 -> 00:11:13]  velocity okay unless acted upon by some force so it has no net force acting on it you'll
[00:11:13 -> 00:11:19]  remain at rest or in a state of constant motion so our free particle here Lagrangian is just
[00:11:19 -> 00:11:26]  equal to the kinetic energy now Lagrangian for our free particle is the form L as a function
[00:11:26 -> 00:11:33]  of X mu X mu dot and lambda and it takes the form of half m g mu nu X dot mu X dot
[00:11:33 -> 00:11:38]  mu now the half there is for good reason you'll see as we go along there's actually necessary
[00:11:38 -> 00:11:47]  to be there some papers and textbooks put a two out front and I've seen some cases left
[00:11:47 -> 00:11:51]  out but it is actually necessary and you'll see why as we go along it is necessary to
[00:11:51 -> 00:11:58]  have that form of half m g mu nu and so on okay so there's some some papers and textbooks
[00:11:58 -> 00:12:02]  just put a two out front but I'll just leave the half in front it's a familiar form we
[00:12:02 -> 00:12:09]  used to so our Lagrangian then if we expand all this out becomes L as m on two times this
[00:12:09 -> 00:12:20]  is the GTT term GT phi term the cross term the R term the GRR G theta theta and G phi
[00:12:20 -> 00:12:28]  phi term okay so written all out with these coordinates okay now the Euler Lagrange equation
[00:12:28 -> 00:12:34]  given by the total derivative DD lambda of this object here which is the partial derivative
[00:12:34 -> 00:12:41]  of the Lagrangian with respect to the X dot coordinate minus TL DX mu is zero or the partial
[00:12:41 -> 00:12:48]  derivative of the Lagrangian with the X mu coordinate okay so starting with the first
[00:12:48 -> 00:12:56]  coordinate X zero is T and so X dot of zero is T dot just notice too with the coordinates
[00:12:56 -> 00:13:03]  I use CT and CT dot I'm just just here I only want to refer I'm just referring to time here
[00:13:03 -> 00:13:12]  but you'll see the CT dot will appear and so on okay so DD lambda of DL DT dot minus DL DT is DD
[00:13:12 -> 00:13:19]  lambda m on two minus two times this we took the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect
[00:13:19 -> 00:13:26]  to T dot and so we only have one T dot here now so we've got C squared times T dot so that partial
[00:13:27 -> 00:13:33]  derivative and then there was another T dot where the cross term is was and hence we've come out
[00:13:33 -> 00:13:39]  with this okay now the Lagrangian was not a function of T at all remember we talked about
[00:13:39 -> 00:13:47]  that beginning of the video and so that term there is just zero this is very nice now because we have
[00:13:47 -> 00:13:51]  DD lambda this object here is equal to zero and that suggests the first integral straight away
[00:13:51 -> 00:13:57]  but before I do that I'm just going to divide through by two divide this whole thing the right
[00:13:57 -> 00:14:06]  sides by two so that cancels a two there okay and I'm just left with GTT C squared T dot minus GT
[00:14:06 -> 00:14:13]  Phi dividing through by two okay is equal to zero and that tells us straight away there's a first
[00:14:13 -> 00:14:25]  integral okay our first integral then all of this is equal to a constant okay so we integrating both
[00:14:25 -> 00:14:32]  sides it means the derivative here is gone we're left with the original argument in here and it's
[00:14:32 -> 00:14:37]  equal to a constant now I'm wondering why I said negative constant and I'll be getting to that
[00:14:37 -> 00:14:43]  shortly okay now I can just summarize this a little bit more this is GTT here so I'll write
[00:14:43 -> 00:14:52]  that there M on 2 times GTT CT dot and then extra factor of C and then over here I've got plus GT
[00:14:52 -> 00:14:59]  Phi times the M on 2 Phi dot here and an extra factor of C and for the moment I'm just going to
[00:14:59 -> 00:15:03]  call that minus E and they'll become apparent shortly why that is you're wondering what on
[00:15:03 -> 00:15:10]  earth is E let's go have a look all right now first we note that the co-varying component
[00:15:10 -> 00:15:21]  momentum PT is MUT so that's the co-varying component UT M on 2 GTT UT plus M on 2 GT Phi U
[00:15:21 -> 00:15:30]  Phi M on 2 GTT CT dot plus M on 2 GT Phi Phi dot okay great so far we've got that that expands out
[00:15:30 -> 00:15:37]  okay now if an observer with a 4-velocity U encounters a particle with 4-momentum P then
[00:15:37 -> 00:15:44]  he she measures the energy of that particle to be E is minus the 4-momentum vector dotted or
[00:15:44 -> 00:15:51]  the inner product with or the scalar product dot product with a 4-velocity U okay so the
[00:15:51 -> 00:15:57]  observer has the 4-velocity they encounter at some point a particle with 4-momentum P okay
[00:15:57 -> 00:16:05]  and then that person will measure the energy E to be this okay now the 4-momentum the covariant
[00:16:05 -> 00:16:13]  form minus E on C PR P theta P Phi all right so I'll just keep that's that's our vector and what
[00:16:13 -> 00:16:20]  we're going to do now observer at rest far from the source mass will have a 4-velocity U mu okay
[00:16:20 -> 00:16:26]  so a distant observer sufficiently far tending towards infinity if you want but far from the
[00:16:26 -> 00:16:31]  source basically we'll have a 4-velocity they'll have no spatial components so that's 0 0 0 and
[00:16:31 -> 00:16:42]  the 4-velocity will just be C 0 0 0 now so there's our 4-velocity here is our 4-momentum components
[00:16:42 -> 00:16:47]  here well when we take the scalar product of these two vectors or the inner product of these two
[00:16:47 -> 00:16:52]  vectors what we're going to have the only components going to show up is a time component at the
[00:16:52 -> 00:17:00]  beginning that's that minus a on C we already have a minus sign for that so we have minus
[00:17:00 -> 00:17:13]  PT okay minus and then PT is minus a on C so there's two negatives there they cancel times
[00:17:13 -> 00:17:20]  this C factor here we get a which is just the energy so what we found is the energy okay so
[00:17:20 -> 00:17:26]  this is the this is the total energy of the particle and it will be conserved along the
[00:17:26 -> 00:17:31]  geodesic followed by the particle okay because that deals with a time component there's a
[00:17:31 -> 00:17:38]  killing vector in the time direction so energy be conserved throughout the all along the geodesic
[00:17:38 -> 00:17:46]  so PT the covariant component of the momentum the covariant T component of the momentum sorry
[00:17:46 -> 00:17:52]  times C is this object here which looks a bit familiar because that's what we found on the
[00:17:52 -> 00:17:58]  previous page okay now these metric terms here are negative negative and so the left-hand side
[00:17:58 -> 00:18:04]  would be negative and so it's necessary for this to be a minus a that's why on the previous page
[00:18:04 -> 00:18:11]  previous slide sorry we had a negative a here and by doing that it as you can see it works out up
[00:18:11 -> 00:18:19]  here because energy should be a positive quantity and so to do that we need to make this a negative
[00:18:19 -> 00:18:24]  constant from from the previous slide it must be because if you look over here that's negative
[00:18:24 -> 00:18:30]  GTT GT by the cross term is negative so the whole left-hand side of this is negative and we just
[00:18:30 -> 00:18:35]  left it equal to a plus C that wouldn't make sense that be suggesting that the energy is a negative
[00:18:35 -> 00:18:44]  quantity which it can't be and that's why I'm remaking this video actually because it's a
[00:18:44 -> 00:18:50]  remake of the previous I'm replacing the old one all right now for the fourth coordinate X theta
[00:18:50 -> 00:19:00]  is Phi so X dot 3 X dot 3 sorry third coordinate is Phi dot and DD lambda DL D Phi dot minus DL
[00:19:00 -> 00:19:09]  D Phi L the Lagrangian is DD lambda and DL D Phi dot is this object here I can't show you
[00:19:09 -> 00:19:14]  Lagrangian at the moment it's on the previous slide but we go in here this was a cross term
[00:19:14 -> 00:19:19]  there was a Phi dot here we've differentiated with respect to that so that's gone and up here
[00:19:19 -> 00:19:25]  there was a Phi dot squared hence the 2 has come out here okay now the Lagrangian was not a function
[00:19:25 -> 00:19:31]  of Phi on its own so that term is 0 on the end here and all that's equal to 0 now what we have
[00:19:31 -> 00:19:40]  here is DD lambda of this in the brackets here in the parentheses is equal to 0 now what I'm
[00:19:40 -> 00:19:44]  going to do is divide through again by 2 to get rid of this factor here which came from the
[00:19:44 -> 00:19:52]  differentiation up here and the 4 there so when I do that I get this which is the cross term GT Phi
[00:19:52 -> 00:20:03]  G Phi T and this 2 here disappears so it becomes this is the metric term G Phi Phi okay and when
[00:20:03 -> 00:20:13]  we a first integral of that is this object here equal to a constant and so we can now summarize
[00:20:13 -> 00:20:24]  this is M on 2 times G Phi T times CT dot okay this one here is M on 2 G Phi Phi times Phi dot
[00:20:24 -> 00:20:36]  so G Phi Phi here times Phi dot and that's equal to a constant constant H now this component the
[00:20:36 -> 00:20:41]  particles for momentum is conserved along geodesics and there's another killing vector
[00:20:41 -> 00:20:47]  in the direction of the Phi coordinate and so this is a conserved quantity along the geodesic
[00:20:47 -> 00:20:53]  so particle following along the geodesic but only this component of full momentum is conserved the
[00:20:53 -> 00:21:01]  total for momentum involves the other angular coordinate and the variables T and R and that
[00:21:01 -> 00:21:07]  is not conserved the total angular momentum is not conserved remember there are no purely radial
[00:21:07 -> 00:21:15]  paths in there these particles for momentum will change angular sorry this particles angular
[00:21:15 -> 00:21:24]  momentum will change due to the inertial frame dragging effect okay so P Phi is MU Phi M on 2
[00:21:24 -> 00:21:33]  G Phi T UT plus M on 2 G Phi Phi U Phi the metric here you can see these terms TT sums out and we're
[00:21:33 -> 00:21:42]  left with U Phi Phi and a Phi here sum out we're left with U Phi lowered okay so PM U Phi now you
[00:21:42 -> 00:21:47]  see why the halves were necessary for the Lagrange in the beginning it was necessary to put in the
[00:21:47 -> 00:21:56]  halves there this makes sense M on 2 G Phi T CT dot so on is equal to constant H this component
[00:21:56 -> 00:22:05]  of angular momentum this component is conserved along geodesics okay so we have two equations
[00:22:05 -> 00:22:13]  now here they are all right now we can write this in matrix form because the next thing we'd like
[00:22:13 -> 00:22:20]  to do is why not solve for CT dot and Phi dot the coordinates the first derivative of those coordinates
[00:22:20 -> 00:22:29]  to help us find the fall velocity okay so we can express CT dot and Phi dot in terms of E and H
[00:22:30 -> 00:22:37]  and the metric terms so let's write out the matrix here CT dot Phi dot and I'm just going to
[00:22:38 -> 00:22:46]  compactify that into a single object a11 a12 a21 and a22 times that that's the metric that's the
[00:22:46 -> 00:22:53]  matrix sorry matrix sorry that's the matrix times the vector CT dot Phi dot is minus EH
[00:22:53 -> 00:23:00]  okay where the solutions of the form CT dot Phi dot is M inverse the inverse of this matrix here
[00:23:01 -> 00:23:08]  multiplied with this vector minus EH now the determinant of M here the determinant of this
[00:23:08 -> 00:23:18]  is a11 times a22 minus a12 a21 okay and when we do that using these terms here we'll have
[00:23:18 -> 00:23:25]  M on 2 all squared times a factor of C and we will have this object here
[00:23:29 -> 00:23:29]  now
[00:23:32 -> 00:23:36]  we've seen this object before part of it anyway now the inverse
[00:23:36 -> 00:23:43]  M inverse is 1 on the determinant times the adjoint of M and so 1 on the determinant is this
[00:23:43 -> 00:23:50]  and the adjoint is this simply swapping these two terms along the diagonal and then the negative of
[00:23:50 -> 00:23:59]  these two all right so filling all that out let's substitute in when we do all that put all these
[00:23:59 -> 00:24:09]  terms in when we do that we get this 4 on CM squared and then the half there we can divide
[00:24:09 -> 00:24:15]  we'll multiply 3 by 4 get rid of that we'll just have 2 a factor of 2 out front and then these
[00:24:15 -> 00:24:27]  objects here okay factors of C and C here and CM here the M2 cancelled this one of the M's down
[00:24:27 -> 00:24:35]  here so the solutions are CT dot phi dot is M inverse minus EH this object here times this
[00:24:39 -> 00:24:46]  and writing them out line by line CT dot will be this object times that first row
[00:24:47 -> 00:24:55]  here we go and phi dot will be this object here times the second row to give us this
[00:24:57 -> 00:25:05]  all right next step now just note that from a previous video on the inverse metric for the
[00:25:05 -> 00:25:11]  Kerr geometry in the metric in the Kerr metric series we found this object before to be this
[00:25:12 -> 00:25:18]  and delta of course is this and so we can rewrite this as in this form here which would just be
[00:25:18 -> 00:25:22]  handy in the next video and so on so writing out our solutions before we get CT dot is this object
[00:25:22 -> 00:25:32]  here which is this okay because that 2 on CM all of this here just becomes minus 2 on CM delta
[00:25:32 -> 00:25:37]  sine squared theta and then we'll just multiply 3 by sine squared theta so that'll simplify
[00:25:37 -> 00:25:48]  that bit more minus 2 on CM delta times that and then phi dot writing that out
[00:25:48 -> 00:25:56]  okay minus 2 on CM delta sine squared theta all of that there
[00:26:00 -> 00:26:05]  okay and then again I will just leave that one as is actually there's
[00:26:06 -> 00:26:12]  full stop later there now so far we have found the following components of the tangent vector
[00:26:12 -> 00:26:18]  to a generalized geodesic where u mu is dx mu d lambda is CT dot and then we've yet to find
[00:26:18 -> 00:26:24]  these two which we'll do in the next video and phi dot so we've got these two the zero term and
[00:26:24 -> 00:26:29]  the third one or first and fourth and then next video we'll find the form of the equations of
[00:26:29 -> 00:26:36]  motion for the other two coordinates r dot theta dot and they will be a bit more involved
