[00:00:00 -> 00:00:10]  Hello and welcome. This is For a Better Tomorrow, the University of Derby's innovation and research
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:15]  podcast. I'm Lewis Allsop and every episode I chat to someone in academia about what they're
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:21]  working on and how it will make our lives better. Now in previous episodes, I've spoken
[00:00:21 -> 00:00:25]  to researchers answering questions like how we can use computers to help us understand
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:32]  the world and how mirrors are helping us to make solar energy more efficient. But today
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:38]  I want to talk history, although I don't really. You see, one of the ways that we can try and
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:43]  make society better in the here and now is actually by looking back through the archives
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:50]  to understand events of the past. And today I want to talk about just that. How can analysis
[00:00:50 -> 00:00:56]  of events from the past inform our current decision making? Well, to help me find out,
[00:00:56 -> 00:01:01]  I'm joined by Professor Keith MacLeay, who's provost of learning and teaching here at the
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:05]  University of Derby, as well as being a historian. It's lovely to see you. I mean, before we
[00:01:05 -> 00:01:08]  get into all of that, just tell me a bit about you, first of all.
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:12]  My name is Professor Keith MacLeay and I'm the provost learning and teaching at the University
[00:01:12 -> 00:01:18]  of Derby, which is quite an odd title in many respects. When you say provost, not many people
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:24]  know what that is or what that means. I'm not necessarily sure I do, but in reality,
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:29]  what it means is that in terms of the university's learning and teaching, its curricula, its
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:36]  academic offer, I'm the university's executive member who has responsibility for that across
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:42]  the institution. So I work with the colleges, I work with the programme teams in respect
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:48]  of the degrees that we offer here at the University of Derby and the learning and teaching which
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:50]  delivers those degree programmes.
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:52]  History, how did you get into it?
[00:01:52 -> 00:01:59]  I just was fascinated by it at school. History is marvellous for providing that illustrative
[00:01:59 -> 00:02:06]  example to help one understand the modern world at the most broadest level or at the
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:12]  micro level as well. And history is wonderful for that and cast the characters, what you
[00:02:12 -> 00:02:17]  can analyse, what you can study, the phenomena that are part of history as well, all are
[00:02:17 -> 00:02:23]  educational and teaches and there's nothing better than, I just love it, I just love history.
[00:02:23 -> 00:02:29]  That's why I became an academic, got into teaching it and I still, even though I have
[00:02:29 -> 00:02:34]  this title provost and there's a leadership role there, I have always throughout my career
[00:02:34 -> 00:02:40]  maintained both my teaching commitments, so I deliver a level four module with a colleague
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:47]  still and keep the research, not at a very, very high level or high tempo because I have
[00:02:47 -> 00:02:51]  other things to do, but to keep working on it as well.
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:55]  We're talking about innovation and research, a very important part of what the university
[00:02:55 -> 00:03:00]  does obviously. And you've got something to talk about today, haven't you?
[00:03:00 -> 00:03:03]  Yeah, that's right. I mean, what I wanted to talk about in terms of my own research
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:09]  is I'm working on the Jacobites at the moment. Now the Jacobites, for those that maybe are
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:16]  not familiar with them, was a group of individuals within the Isles of Britain in the 18th century,
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:24]  primarily. They were adherents of the King James VII and II, who was effectively evicted
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:31]  from the throne in 1688 from Britain. And they were a group of individuals that wanted
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:39]  to see the Stuart House restored to the thrones of the British Isles. And they mounted a series
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:45]  of rebellions periodically through the first half of the 18th century. So the initial one
[00:03:45 -> 00:03:52]  was just at the end of the 17th in 1689. Then we had one in 1707, 1708. And then we had
[00:03:52 -> 00:04:01]  a big one in 1715 and an even bigger one in 1745. And the one that I'm looking at at the
[00:04:01 -> 00:04:10]  moment is that one in 1745, because the Stuart adherents started off in Scotland, led by
[00:04:10 -> 00:04:17]  Bonnie Prince Charlie, who was the grandson of James VII and II. And they marched all
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:21]  the way to Derby. They started off in the Western Isles of Scotland, and they managed
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:28]  to march all the way down to Derby. And it was at Derby in December 1745 that they actually
[00:04:28 -> 00:04:35]  decided to turn around and retreat back to Scotland. And it's that decision and that
[00:04:35 -> 00:04:41]  command decision, which I think is interesting me at the moment. And it's interesting me
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:46]  at one level because it's a historical question. And I'm a historian, so I'm interested in
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:51]  historical questions. But it's also interesting because there is an application on that piece
[00:04:51 -> 00:05:00]  of research, which is, in terms of leadership, how do we arrive at significant decisions,
[00:05:00 -> 00:05:06]  be they political, be they military, be they civil? How do we arrive at that type of decision
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:11]  which can have such a consequential impact upon the subsequent events? Because the decision
[00:05:11 -> 00:05:19]  to retreat on the 5th of December 1745 and return to Scotland was absolutely seminal
[00:05:19 -> 00:05:27]  in terms of the ill-fated success of the rebellion, ultimately. And so that has a modern application,
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:28]  which I'm interested in as well.
[00:05:28 -> 00:05:34]  Yeah, it's a wider question, like you say, just about leadership. How are you going to
[00:05:34 -> 00:05:38]  find this out? Because we can't ask anybody.
[00:05:38 -> 00:05:45]  No, that's right, of course. So historians' methods of research are primarily twofold.
[00:05:45 -> 00:05:51]  So there is a body of secondary literature works by historians already on a topic that
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:57]  you would access, and you'd read, and you'd think about. But most importantly for historians,
[00:05:57 -> 00:06:05]  it's the surviving documentary record or archival sources that you would go to to piece together
[00:06:05 -> 00:06:12]  that, in this instance, the decision-making process. So in other words, I'm looking at
[00:06:12 -> 00:06:18]  correspondence, I'm looking at diaries and memoirs, and trying to understand through
[00:06:18 -> 00:06:24]  reading them and triangulating different pieces of evidence how that leadership decision came
[00:06:24 -> 00:06:25]  about.
[00:06:25 -> 00:06:30]  You're looking into this one decision. It's a very specific time in history. What have
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:35]  you found so far? Have you found anything about the reason behind that one decision?
[00:06:35 -> 00:06:42]  Yes, what I've found, or what my analysis has been, is that to date, that decision on
[00:06:42 -> 00:06:50]  the 5th of December in the War Council of the Jacobites in Derby was primarily characterized
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:57]  as being a purely military decision. In other words, historians have said, hitherto, Bonnie
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:02]  Prince Charlie and his fellow generals decided to retreat to Scotland because there were
[00:07:02 -> 00:07:09]  three columns of the British army converging on Derby from the north and from the south
[00:07:09 -> 00:07:15]  and from the southwest. So therefore, militarily, they were never going to be successful in
[00:07:15 -> 00:07:17]  fighting through to London.
[00:07:17 -> 00:07:20]  So this is where the big sort of explosion was going to be, wasn't it?
[00:07:20 -> 00:07:25]  Yeah, that's right. But my argument is that that was but one element, the military element
[00:07:25 -> 00:07:32]  was but one facet of the decision. What we need to do is to broaden it out, to look at
[00:07:32 -> 00:07:37]  other elements of the decision. So there were political considerations within the War
[00:07:37 -> 00:07:44]  Council themselves. So the War Council was divided between Bonnie Prince Charlie's advisers
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:49]  who had come from Ireland and his advisers who had come from Scotland. Those that had
[00:07:49 -> 00:07:55]  come from Scotland were much more inclined to make good the gains that they had achieved
[00:07:55 -> 00:08:02]  in Scotland already by retreating back to Scotland and holding that position. The Irish
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:07]  contingent were much more enthusiastic to go all the way to London because for them
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:09]  that was the bigger prize.
[00:08:09 -> 00:08:11]  So was there a bit of a fallout?
[00:08:11 -> 00:08:16]  Absolutely. Yeah, there was a bit of fraction and internecine fighting within the War Council,
[00:08:16 -> 00:08:23]  which was politically founded. There was the wider context of support for the Jacobites
[00:08:23 -> 00:08:29]  within Great Britain at the time that there was the assumption that because the Jacobites
[00:08:29 -> 00:08:35]  had got to Derby that clearly they had more support than actually they did. And by the
[00:08:35 -> 00:08:42]  time they got to Derby, it became increasingly apparent that people were not turning out
[00:08:42 -> 00:08:45]  for the Jacobites. So they had marched all the way down from Scotland and through the
[00:08:45 -> 00:08:54]  northwest of England, then turned eastwards to Derby. But they hadn't raised many men
[00:08:54 -> 00:08:58]  on their travels. They had been successful in their march, they hadn't been opposed,
[00:08:58 -> 00:09:02]  but they hadn't brought many people along with them. So fundamentally, another element
[00:09:02 -> 00:09:05]  of the decision was their support was thin.
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:07]  Thinner than they expected.
[00:09:07 -> 00:09:13]  Indeed, absolutely. And if they were going to march on to London, then they were going
[00:09:13 -> 00:09:17]  to have to need more support than they had accrued already. And then the third element
[00:09:17 -> 00:09:23]  in broadening out is a diplomatic context. When Bonnie Prince Charlie left the continent
[00:09:23 -> 00:09:32]  of Europe to come across to Scotland in late 1744, there was an assumption that France
[00:09:32 -> 00:09:40]  in particular, but also the Vatican, and to an extent Spain, would provide some succor,
[00:09:40 -> 00:09:46]  some support for the Jacobite rebellion, particularly France. And indeed, Bonnie Prince Charlie's
[00:09:46 -> 00:09:53]  brother Henry was in France at the time in 45, seeking to bring together support. That
[00:09:53 -> 00:09:58]  support never materialized. And by the time they reached Derby in December 45, it was
[00:09:58 -> 00:10:04]  increasingly clear that the international context was not going to come through for
[00:10:04 -> 00:10:10]  them. So that was another element in the decision making. So hopefully the research is beginning
[00:10:10 -> 00:10:17]  to demonstrate that where before a decision was characterized as one of purely military
[00:10:17 -> 00:10:22]  considerations that will never be successful in fighting through, is now one actually,
[00:10:22 -> 00:10:29]  which is much broader and has a number of contributory elements to it.
[00:10:29 -> 00:10:34]  It was interesting you were speaking about earlier, how this can help us in life today
[00:10:34 -> 00:10:40]  in understanding the way that decisions are made and understanding how decisions should
[00:10:40 -> 00:10:46]  be made. Because that's, I suppose, a really important part of our life politically. It's
[00:10:46 -> 00:10:47]  very important, isn't it?
[00:10:47 -> 00:10:53]  Yeah. So yes, I absolutely agree. You're quite right. And I suppose what I'm trying to show
[00:10:53 -> 00:10:58]  in the modern context, so I talked about the applied nature of this work, and the applied
[00:10:58 -> 00:11:04]  nature is current contemporary leadership decision making. I think, first of all, what
[00:11:04 -> 00:11:12]  I would say is that there needs to be a recognition that in any such decision making process,
[00:11:12 -> 00:11:16]  particularly one that is of significant size and scale, there are a number of what we would
[00:11:16 -> 00:11:22]  call heuristics or biases at work. In the Jacobite example, we talked about the political
[00:11:22 -> 00:11:27]  context, well, that was a bias that they had that was feeding through. So likewise, in
[00:11:27 -> 00:11:33]  any contemporary decision, you need to recognize that the parties to that decision have a number
[00:11:33 -> 00:11:38]  of ingrained biases and prejudices that are coming to the fore.
[00:11:38 -> 00:11:42]  And we see this all the time in politics, in lots of different decisions. People often
[00:11:42 -> 00:11:47]  are biased by the way that they've grown up, the way that they've lived their life, the
[00:11:47 -> 00:11:51]  people that they owe money to. Do you know what I mean? There's lots of different things
[00:11:51 -> 00:11:54]  that can affect our decision making, aren't there?
[00:11:54 -> 00:12:00]  Oh, absolutely. You're absolutely correct there, Lewis. And by applying that research,
[00:12:00 -> 00:12:05]  by using the historical example, we can shed light upon the processes of the contemporary
[00:12:05 -> 00:12:12]  world in terms of leadership arriving at decisions and demonstrating that any decision is much
[00:12:12 -> 00:12:19]  more broadly based than how one might like to characterize it. One might like to say,
[00:12:19 -> 00:12:24]  oh, well, that decision was taken because of X and only X. That's unlikely to be the
[00:12:24 -> 00:12:29]  case. And we can use the historical example to illustrate that.
[00:12:29 -> 00:12:35]  How does this help us now? So this understanding, which is really genuinely very interesting,
[00:12:35 -> 00:12:39]  the way that we make decisions, but how does it help us in our lives now to understand
[00:12:39 -> 00:12:41]  that this is the way decisions are made?
[00:12:41 -> 00:12:47]  Well, I mean, that's a very good question. And I think my answer to that was it's important
[00:12:47 -> 00:12:54]  that leaders across the country, across the world, anyone in a leadership position has
[00:12:54 -> 00:13:01]  a better knowledge and understanding of how they arrive at decisions and decision making
[00:13:01 -> 00:13:07]  and command in that context. Now, they might not want to particularly know that. They might
[00:13:07 -> 00:13:14]  not want to know that they bring prejudices and bias to the table. But they do need to
[00:13:14 -> 00:13:15]  understand that.
[00:13:15 -> 00:13:19]  Because I suppose it's a matter of understanding that we've all got them. We've all got prejudices.
[00:13:19 -> 00:13:24]  We've all got biases. But it's a matter of understanding when to lead them to the side
[00:13:24 -> 00:13:26]  or as best we can, when not to.
[00:13:26 -> 00:13:27]  Yeah.
[00:13:27 -> 00:13:32]  Just finally, speaking about leadership, once again, if I were to want to be Prime Minister,
[00:13:32 -> 00:13:36]  what advice would you give me given the research that you've done?
[00:13:36 -> 00:13:43]  Okay. Understand your prejudices, understand your biases and understand people. And ensure
[00:13:43 -> 00:13:50]  that when you are taking a decision in any step, that you have a broader base as possible
[00:13:50 -> 00:13:56]  in terms of knowledge of the issue that you're seeking to take a decision on before you take
[00:13:56 -> 00:13:57]  that decision.
[00:13:57 -> 00:13:59]  I think I might get my name on the ballot paper now.
[00:13:59 -> 00:14:00]  Good luck to you.
[00:14:00 -> 00:14:02]  Thank you very much for talking to me.
[00:14:02 -> 00:14:04]  Thank you very much, Liz. That was great. Thank you.
[00:14:04 -> 00:14:09]  That is Professor Keith Maclay, Provost of Learning and Teaching at the University of
[00:14:09 -> 00:14:13]  Derby and a historian. And that is it for this episode of For a Better Tomorrow, the
[00:14:13 -> 00:14:19]  University of Derby's innovation and research podcast. Now, in other episodes in the series,
[00:14:19 -> 00:14:25]  I've looked at the research, answering questions like why research itself is so important to
[00:14:25 -> 00:14:32]  the University of Derby and how can proteins help combat the onset of Alzheimer's. They're
[00:14:32 -> 00:14:36]  available now, so be sure to check them out wherever you get your podcasts and follow
[00:14:36 -> 00:14:40]  the University at Derby Uni. I'll see you next time. Bye bye.
[00:14:40 -> 00:14:53]  For a Better Tomorrow was presented by me, Lewis Allsop, and produced by myself and Dr.
[00:14:53 -> 00:14:57]  Darhi McMahon in the School of Arts for the University of Derby.
