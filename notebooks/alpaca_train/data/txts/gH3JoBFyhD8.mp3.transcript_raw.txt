 Hi, this is Erin from the Science Ops Center team here at the St. Louis Science Center.  With a special experiment, our YouTube follower 2000Pancake requested an electricity or magnetism  experiment, so here it is.  We're going to make an electromagnet.  So what you'll need is a nail, a battery, a paper clip or a little staple for testing  things, and then some wire.  The wire can be wire that you might find at Radio Shack or you can even use a wire that's  designed to plug things into the back of your computer or your TV as long as it's okay with  your parents.  The only important thing is that it has to be insulated, it has to be something that's  not metal around the outside.  So you take your wire and you wrap it around the nail.  You want to leave a little bit of room, a couple inches off either end, and just start  wrapping it around.  It all has to go the same direction, but you can double it up if you need to and go back  and forth to make your loops.  Then you're going to connect it to a battery.  Now be careful because when you have two wires connected to a battery, you're shorting it  out and it can get really hot.  So just do it for short bits of time and if you want you can tape one side down for  a little bit if you're afraid of getting hot.  I'm just going to hold the two ends together like this and then test it with my paper clip.  Once you've tested it with one nail, you can try some different things.  You can try multiple paper clips and see how many it can pick up or you can try a different  kind of wire.  For example, this is one we made with really skinny wire.  It's super skinny so we can get more loops on there.  You can try different lengths, different kinds of nails, different kinds of paper clips.  So experiment, see which one works best and when you do that, let us know at scienceoffcenter.org.  Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supply needs!
