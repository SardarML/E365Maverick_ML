It is gone time is life  The  15 secrets successful people know about time management the productivity habits of seven billionaires  13 Olympic athletes  29 straight-a students and  239 entrepreneurs  You might not use all of them  But if you use one two three or four of them tell you you're gonna get a lot more out of your day  Any anyone can make a big difference?  Absolutely  We all have the same amount of time every single one of us has the same amount of time  But some of us squander it some of us wasted some of us don't make best use of it  it's my goal my my hope at the end of this episode that you'll be able to see just how much time you have in the  Day, and there's something something in this episode that you'll be able to use to maybe get more out of your day  And that to me is a win  Absolutely a win in my book  Golden nugget number one time is your most valuable and scarcest resource  Hey  1440 is the number that can change your life and that number is the number of minutes  We all have in a single day and while you know, most of the people that I interviewed  They're not all doing the same 15 secrets either. The the common thread was that they always spoke about  minutes in the value of time and when you truly realize  What like just how valuable a single minute is I mean money we can lose it and make it back again our health  We can get sick and get healthy again  Time once it's gone. It is gone time is life  and so, you know in one minute for your health, you know  You can bang out some push-ups or sit-ups or take a cleansing breath for relationships  You can tell someone that you love them or that you're grateful for them in business  It takes a minute to have a breakthrough idea  And once you truly understand that all of a sudden, you know  You're not gonna let people steal your time with all those got a minute meetings or other trivial things  There's a certain number of minutes every single day that I have at my disposal and so much of it is just wasted minutes  So if you start to capitalize on the time that you have you'll realize holy I can get a whole bunch done  So golden nugget number two identify your most important task and do it first the most important task the MIT  Your MIT is you know, what is that project that is gonna double the size of your business?  What is that project that's gonna get you the promotion or max out your bonus at work and then break it down?  It's like what domino can I tip over today?  that's gonna lean on the next one and the next one and then we have to get in that discipline of  scheduling time to work on our MIT  First thing in the morning  Behavioral psychologist Dan Ariely talks about we are at our best for about a two-hour window of time in the morning  You know, we're at our cognitive best. But what most of us do we stroll in with you know to work we open up email  We start working on everybody else's MIT's by answering their emails and all that stuff  Before we respond to text before we listen to voicemails before we do email. We should work on our MIT  Golden nugget number three work from your calendar not a to-do list  Stop using a to-do list, you know, I was asking all of these people self-made billionaires self-made millionaires  What is your number one secret of productivity?  They could have said anything and none of them mentioned a to-do list  I was about halfway through the interviews and finally I started doing the follow-up. I'm like, well, what about your to-do list?  Give me some advice. They laughed at me. They're like to-do list  You know, we work from a calendar and as I did the research it turns out  41% of items that people put on their to-do list are never done at all  It's like a to-do list is is the graveyard of you know  Important but not urgent if you really want to get something done  Pick a day a time and a duration and then live from your calendar  Golden nugget number four to overcome procrastination beat your future self  So we need to think about all right  How's that future evil version of ourself gonna jeopardize our best intentions and you know  Let's say we want to start jogging this week. We want to we want to work out. Well, you know what?  I know that my evil self is gonna hit that snooze alarm. How do I how do I fight back?  I'm gonna I'm gonna put my iPhone to set that alarm put on the other side of the room  So I got to literally get out of bed to shut it off and that evil Kevin's gonna say oh man  I don't know where my workout stuff is. I'll work out tomorrow instead. Well, you know what?  I'm gonna beat that future version by putting my sneakers right at the end of my bed  In fact, I'm gonna go to sleep in my shorts and t-shirt  So I just need to put my sneakers on and I'm dressed nice, you know  so we just need to think about all the ways that we're gonna procrastinate all those excuses were to come up with and try to  Beat them in the present moment  Golden nugget number five there will always be more to do  Back when I was young a young and dumb entrepreneur, you know  I was the guy who was just eight hours a day wasn't enough  So I'd work 16 or 25 days a week wasn't enough  I'd work seven the girlfriend or eventually the wife would be like hey at six o'clock  Dinner's cold when you coming home leave in the office in five minutes, then it's an hour later  I'm still in the office and you know  One of the things that I learned from interviewing all these people is  They have this sense in their bones like there will always be more to do  Andy Grove wrote he was the founder and CEO of Intel and he said, you know  My day ends when I'm tired and ready to go home. Not when I'm done because I am never done a  Manager's work is never done. There's always more to be done more that should be done always more than can be done  Maybe you know, maybe we've decided that we're gonna work a 10-hour day or a 12-hour day or a 6-hour day  Whatever you decide be intentional about it and then realize you've allocated other minutes for your health  Which is gym time you've allocated other minutes for your relationship including date night or with time with your kids  Golden nugget number six always carry a notebook  Everybody I spoke to talked about carrying a notebook, you know  Richard Branson has written about it over and over again. He says the single most important possession is his little notebook  That's how he built, you know, the Virgin brand, you know, there's all these  People that I interviewed that just swear by this power of of jotting down little notes  Whether it's journaling or notes from meetings or words of wisdom from the books they read, but it just really changes their life  Yeah  And one of the things that David Allen always says that our minds are best used for for processing different types of information  For processing different ideas not to hold on to information  you'd be surprised when you start carrying around a notebook with you just how much information comes into your mind that you want to  Capture now when you start capturing that information you realize holy crap  I've been holding on to so many good like pieces of information and it's just been gone  Like I just lose it or I hold on to it and it just ruins the ability to allow your mind to free itself up  To process new information, which is the best state for your mind to be in  Golden nugget number seven  Control your inbox to be honest many of us use our email inbox  jet and text messages and other social media apps as a form of procrastination as a form of a  Little reward it releases dopamine. It's kind of like pulling that handle on a slot machines  They're gonna be something good and all of these companies out there and other people in our lives  They want our attention and that's fine, but it can get in the way of our productivity. So the bottom line is  Shut off the notifications on your phone on everything  It's okay to go to email or messages and all of that  But do it when you want to do it not because someone else is  Calling you kind of like Pavlov's dog, you know ringing a bell and I'm reaching for my phone. I  Process email like anything else three times a day morning noon and night now again  The number is not so important, right?  I mean, you know  I know people who only process it once a week or once a day and others people tell me hey  I'm a stockbroker whatever. I need to get back to people all the time fine  Process that every 30 minutes or 15 minutes. The idea is to be intentional about it  Shut off the notification. So if you're out there and you haven't shut off your email notifications, what are you waiting for?  I've done that a long time ago. I shut it off because it's just distraction  Golden nugget number eight schedule and attend meetings as a last resort  Now we can't all you know  Be like Mark Cuban and just say no to our boss and other people with meetings  We can say no much more often. We can say no to a lot of meetings  We could say no to meetings before noon  Like let's keep our deep work in the morning then our collaborative work in the afternoon  And if you have to say yes to a meeting  Say no to long meetings  Richard Branson again says there's few meetings that need to last more than five or ten minutes  And so that's just the idea  Let's say no as often as possible at least one day a week say no and then try to say no to long meetings  Absolutely, not actually, you know what that breaks us into the next golden nugget golden nugget number nine say no to  Everything that doesn't support your immediate goals  They're they're not being rude  But the most highly successful people  They know what their values are their goals are and they fill their calendar with things that'll get there and that doesn't leave time for  A lot of other other things, you know, we're raised from being really young to like hey, you know  You you want to be liked so you want to help people you're told it's nice to help people. You don't want to be rude  What's helpful to me is when I realized that every every time I say yes to something  I'm actually saying no to another thing or many things. I  Got myself into so much trouble man, because I like to be liked and so I would say yes to people all the time  Even though I knew by saying yes, it would screw up my schedule  I'd have to push other things back in the back of my head. I was like, you're not gonna do this anymore  You're not gonna go to the gym your whole schedules thrown off. Well, of course  Getting good at saying no and doing it in a very polite way in a delicate way is  Something that a lot of you out there have to do  Golden nugget number ten follow the powerful Pareto principle  and Pareto principle is more commonly known as the 80-20 rule and it's this idea that  most of the results in almost any activity 80% of the results comes from about  20% of the activity so it's just really  Pausing slowing down and looking at with all the work that you're doing to build your business to get your work done  You know, what are the handful of tasks that are getting you most of your results just focus on those things  Golden nugget number 11 focus on your unique strengths and passion  We really need to remember the power of delegation, you know, I'm a perfectionist  So nobody can do anything as good as I can  You know, I've got to do everything to do it, right and the reality Ryan is that might be true  but we have to realize again think about that 80-20 rule this feeds into this that yes if I delegate it to  Someone on my team, maybe it's not gonna be perfect  But if it's 80% to perfect I need to be okay with that and let it go because now that just freed up all of  my time  Golden nugget number 12 batch your work with recurring themes. So this one, you know, you read in the book innovative entrepreneurs  They really assign different themes to their office days that employees can really concentrate on one specific type of work  Well known sort of consultant to consultants Dan Sullivan, you know  He talks about entrepreneurs should have focus days buffer days and free days and the focus days  You know, those are your game days  Those are those are the days where you are doing your most important activities  Usually it's sales or revenue related but whatever your strengths are a buffer day  That's the day to catch up on phone calls and emails and sign paperwork and you know, all the other  Administrative stuff we have to do and then free days are the days where you do not work  And what you're doing is you're resting and recharging which all the Olympic athletes really talked to me about that  Golden nugget number 13 if you can do a task in less than five minutes do it immediately  So this really comes down to the touch it once principle  I'm I go to an extreme on this one. I walked to get the mail out of the mailbox every day  Well, most people you come inside and there's the two piles  There's the junk pile and then the bills and then later we go through the junk again  And then we go through the bills again on my walk back up to the garage  I am sorting that junk and I'm dropping it right in the recycle bin before I even get into my house  Those bills they go into the bill pile, which again I process on Friday afternoons  I don't even open the envelopes until I'm ready to do them  You know, I don't I don't care about what my electric bill or cable bill is  I'm just gonna leave it sit there until I'm ready to to process it  So, you know email you open an email when you're ready to process it in that moment. Just learn to touch everything once  Golden nugget number 14 routinely use early mornings to strengthen your mind your body and your spirit  Because you know, I'm asking people give me your number one productivity tip. So I'm expecting to hear about  task lists and calendars and  priorities  So many people said my number one productivity tip is what I do in the first hour of my day  And they're not talking about getting work done. They're talking about their mind and body  Most of the people that I interviewed these high performers  They weren't waking up feeling stressed rushing to the office and diving into emails  Day at first hour that first 30 minutes. They were investing in themselves for the long game  Last but certainly not least golden nugget number 15  Productivity is about energy and focus not time  You know, we all have the same  1,440 minutes a day. We can't get more of that. It's not about managing the time  So the idea is first of all take care of our bodies light cardio lots of water get good deep sleep  In addition to that the most productive people they actually take more breaks  So we're designed to kind of like sprint and rest sprint and rest  And so again to each of their own, you know, a lot of people like this Pomodoro technique, you know  You just sprint for 25 minutes then pop up and walk around get some air get some water  The idea is to spend more time on  Single tasking all out focused attention, you know these working jam sessions then a little break and then get back to it  Go to cut the crap podcast.com  Also, don't forget to connect with me on LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Instagram all that stuff  You see what I'm doing and see what I'm up to throughout the week  You  You
