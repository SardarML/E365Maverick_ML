 Invest maybe in good cameras at home, not the crappy laptop.  Am I allowed to say crappy? I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say crappy.  The most important part is enabling hybrid work.  To ensure that people who are working from home, are working from elsewhere,  can still participate and contribute is really, really crucial.  We have new technologies that everybody can take advantage of,  including the employee experience that enables people to be able to work from home.  Bringing new features into Teams that enable the entire workforce to be able to work together.  I come from a SharePoint background, and that's great for collaboration around documents.  It's not great for communication in terms of conversations, chats,  and that's where Teams brings that together.  In the office, make sure you have proper tooling, proper team room systems in place  that you can actually facilitate a hybrid meeting.  I still see often that people who are dialed in are not as participating in a conversation  as the people who are in the room at the office, maybe.  Make sure that people are given the opportunity just to do that kind of knowledge exchange-based stuff,  the kind of things we used to do around the coffee machine.  More bringing people together to accomplish a specific thing based on the skills that they need,  communicating out the successes or failures from that,  and then disbanding and going on to form the next thing.  It's really important for me to make sure that you don't overwhelm the people.  So whatever new is coming, whatever you want to introduce in your organization,  make sure it works within the culture you have, and make sure that you don't overwhelm people.  We're excited about all the new stuff, but not everybody necessarily is.  So just make sure that you're taking it in stride, you're listening to your end users,  and you really introduce what's important for them.  Microsoft Mechanics  www.microsoft.com
