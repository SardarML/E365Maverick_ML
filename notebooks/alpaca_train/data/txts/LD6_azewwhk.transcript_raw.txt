 This video is the first in a two-part series that looks at how a free particle moves in  the region outside an uncharged rotating black hole described by the Kerr metric.  The first, this first video derives the equations of the geodesics for the time t and azimuthal  angle phi coordinates.  It uses the Lagrangian method.  Now we can find the equations of the geodesics of free particles in the Kerr geometry using  the Euler-Lagrange equations and that will be the focus of this and the next video.  Now our aim is to find the form of the equations for the t dot, r dot, theta dot and phi dot  coordinates.  So we're describing this path in terms of the coordinates t, r, theta and phi.  t will be scaled to be ct and those coordinates will be parameterized in terms of an affine  parameter lambda.  For a particle with mass that parameter lambda would be the proper time but for a massless  particle we can't use proper time so we use a generalized affine parameter lambda.  The situation is we're going to have a rotating source mass.  This oblates phoroidal shape, dilated, bulging in the equatorial direction so dilated away  from the axis of rotation in the equatorial plane, in the equatorial plane direction.  And as I said it will be parameterized in terms of lambda.  Tangent to these geodesics is the 4-velocity of the particle and throughout these two videos  we'll work with the 4-velocity and the 4-momentum.  Now both the 4-velocity and the 4-momentum are tangent to the geodesics at all points.  So the 4-momentum vector and the 4-velocity vector are tangent.  In terms of the 4-velocity we have ct dot, r dot, theta dot, phi dot as the coordinates  and the magnitude of this vector for a particle with mass will be minus c squared.  Now the magnitude is the 4-velocity vector dotted with itself, the scalar or inner product  of the vector gives us minus c squared and that will be the total derivative dx mu, the  coordinates with respect to the parameter lambda.  So x dot mu, the dot will stand for dx mu d lambda, so it's differentiating the coordinates  with respect to lambda.  So each dot will be differentiating with respect to lambda, so two dots will be the second  derivative with respect to lambda.  Coming back to the 4-momentum of the particle, its magnitude, the 4-momentum vector is tangent  to the geodesics followed by the particle, the free particle.  And that is equal to that magnitude of the 4-momentum vector with itself, the inner product,  the scalar product, is p dot p will be minus m squared c squared.  The minus m squared c squared for the 4-momentum inner product and for the 4-velocity inner  product is minus c squared and the reason it's minus because on this channel I always  use the metric minus 1 plus plus plus, so I use an overall positive metric with the  zero component having a negative, being negative.  Other textbooks, other sources will also use the opposite metric where you have plus minus  minus minus.  Okay, so now our form is defined, our aim is to find the form of the equations for the  t dot r dot theta and phi dot coordinates, okay, which gives us the 4-velocity of the  particle and we can also use to get the 4-momentum as you'll see when we go on.  So our rotating source mass creates a space time around it, the metric, the curve metric,  this is the line element but within it is the metric but anyway it's often called the  metric but it's actually the line element, so ds squared is this object here, so it's  the line element or space time interval, it's this object here.  Now the curve geometry is not spherically symmetric like the Schwarzschild case due  to the frame dragging effect and the dilation in the equatorial plane due to rotation.  So in the Schwarzschild case we had a spherical shape, this one is oblate spheroidal because  of the rotation, so it bulges in the direction of the equatorial plane, okay, it dilates  away from the rotation axis.  So for those two reasons there you have a geometry that's not spherically symmetric.  Now that has some implications, so that means that purely radial paths for test particles  are not possible, meaning that the total angular momentum of these particles is not conserved.  But in the Schwarzschild case we could have particles that came in on purely radial trajectories  because this was a sphere, it was symmetrical in all ways.  It also meant that in the Schwarzschild case you could have motion confined to a single  plane and that plane could be rotated about the centre of the sphere there in any way  you liked.  The high degree of spherical symmetry meant that radial paths were possible but in this  case we don't have spherical symmetry.  You have the start, the source mass is not a sphere, it bulges in the equatorial plane  so it's dilated away from the, flattened in a direction away from the rotation axis.  And you have the frame dragging effect also which means that angular momentum cannot be  conserved, the total angular momentum cannot be conserved and no purely radial paths are  possible.  Okay.  We'll just come back to that, we'll pursue that a little bit more.  So no particle can travel on a purely radial path due to the dragging of the inertial frames  effect and so the particle's trajectory is affected such that its angular velocity is  its phi component momentum, for momentum over its time component or gt phi on gtt is equal  to the angular velocity which is a function of r and theta.  So a particle of mass m must as it moves in towards the rotating source mass it must rotate  with the source mass.  Now all of that, this equation here is all part of the Kerr metric video series so please  go have a look at that but I'm just quoting that result from here to show you that with  the frame dragging any particle coming in must rotate as it moves towards the source  must rotate with the source and okay must co-rotate with the source you can't rotate  against it and so that twists paths out of the purely radial into other other directions.  So a free particle travels along geodesics just reminding everyone of that free particle.  Now by fixing r and theta notice the angular velocity here can be held constant if r and  theta are fixed can have now by fixing r and theta the free particle can have constant  angular momentum by moving along some geodesic in the phi direction.  So as long as it's moving in the phi direction okay that's this way around the anticlockwise  way as long as it's moving in the phi direction it can have constant angular momentum for  that component.  So I'll just build on that shortly we'll just come here I'll deal with that in a minute  but the Kerr geometry is stationary and axisymmetric so a stationary spacetime is one for which  all the components of the metric geomini are independent of t this means the spacetime  outside the mass does not change over time so the partial derivative of the metric with  respect to time component is zero and that implies that in this direction in the direction  of the time coordinate we have a Killing vector K which is K T E T or for physicists  vector basis form here or the differential operator for those with more of a differential  geometry leaning both meaning the same thing anyway.  An axially symmetric spacetime is one for which the components of the metric geomini  are independent of the angle involved which in this case is phi so this means the component  of the angular momentum P phi in the direction the rotation axis is conserved so the spacetime  outside the mass does not change when moving in that phi direction okay so that component  of angular momentum is conserved but the total angular momentum also involves the theta component  and the other coordinates and that's not conserved but the purely angular momentum  component P phi is conserved okay as long as you fix R and theta.  So the partial derivative of the metric with respect to phi is zero so there's another  Killing vector in the direction the phi direction so component K phi basis vector E phi or K  phi and partial derivative of operator D phi okay so we wish to find the equations  of the geodesics followed by a free particle of mass M whose coordinates are given by X  mu equals X mu of lambda parameter lambda for a particle of mass best to use the proper  time but here I'm going to keep it general so that we can refer to photons and massless  particles in general now X mu of lambda is Ct of lambda R of lambda theta of lambda  phi of lambda so they're all parameterized in terms of this parameter lambda now these  geodesics of tangent vectors U mu is the X mu to lambda is X dot mu so that's the notation  being used now for a free particle we can use the Euler Lagrange equations to derive  the form of the geodesic for some Lagrangian L is T minus V and for a free particle the  Lagrangian is simply equal to the kinetic energy term there's no potential this is particle  has no net forces acting on it so it's it's not acting within any potential there's no  net forces on this so it's a free particle in the Newtonian case a free particle just  continues moving in a straight line remains at rest or moves at a constant speed or constant  velocity okay unless acted upon by some force so it has no net force acting on it you'll  remain at rest or in a state of constant motion so our free particle here Lagrangian is just  equal to the kinetic energy now Lagrangian for our free particle is the form L as a function  of X mu X mu dot and lambda and it takes the form of half m g mu nu X dot mu X dot  mu now the half there is for good reason you'll see as we go along there's actually necessary  to be there some papers and textbooks put a two out front and I've seen some cases left  out but it is actually necessary and you'll see why as we go along it is necessary to  have that form of half m g mu nu and so on okay so there's some some papers and textbooks  just put a two out front but I'll just leave the half in front it's a familiar form we  used to so our Lagrangian then if we expand all this out becomes L as m on two times this  is the GTT term GT phi term the cross term the R term the GRR G theta theta and G phi  phi term okay so written all out with these coordinates okay now the Euler Lagrange equation  given by the total derivative DD lambda of this object here which is the partial derivative  of the Lagrangian with respect to the X dot coordinate minus TL DX mu is zero or the partial  derivative of the Lagrangian with the X mu coordinate okay so starting with the first  coordinate X zero is T and so X dot of zero is T dot just notice too with the coordinates  I use CT and CT dot I'm just just here I only want to refer I'm just referring to time here  but you'll see the CT dot will appear and so on okay so DD lambda of DL DT dot minus DL DT is DD  lambda m on two minus two times this we took the partial derivative of the Lagrangian with respect  to T dot and so we only have one T dot here now so we've got C squared times T dot so that partial  derivative and then there was another T dot where the cross term is was and hence we've come out  with this okay now the Lagrangian was not a function of T at all remember we talked about  that beginning of the video and so that term there is just zero this is very nice now because we have  DD lambda this object here is equal to zero and that suggests the first integral straight away  but before I do that I'm just going to divide through by two divide this whole thing the right  sides by two so that cancels a two there okay and I'm just left with GTT C squared T dot minus GT  Phi dividing through by two okay is equal to zero and that tells us straight away there's a first  integral okay our first integral then all of this is equal to a constant okay so we integrating both  sides it means the derivative here is gone we're left with the original argument in here and it's  equal to a constant now I'm wondering why I said negative constant and I'll be getting to that  shortly okay now I can just summarize this a little bit more this is GTT here so I'll write  that there M on 2 times GTT CT dot and then extra factor of C and then over here I've got plus GT  Phi times the M on 2 Phi dot here and an extra factor of C and for the moment I'm just going to  call that minus E and they'll become apparent shortly why that is you're wondering what on  earth is E let's go have a look all right now first we note that the co-varying component  momentum PT is MUT so that's the co-varying component UT M on 2 GTT UT plus M on 2 GT Phi U  Phi M on 2 GTT CT dot plus M on 2 GT Phi Phi dot okay great so far we've got that that expands out  okay now if an observer with a 4-velocity U encounters a particle with 4-momentum P then  he she measures the energy of that particle to be E is minus the 4-momentum vector dotted or  the inner product with or the scalar product dot product with a 4-velocity U okay so the  observer has the 4-velocity they encounter at some point a particle with 4-momentum P okay  and then that person will measure the energy E to be this okay now the 4-momentum the covariant  form minus E on C PR P theta P Phi all right so I'll just keep that's that's our vector and what  we're going to do now observer at rest far from the source mass will have a 4-velocity U mu okay  so a distant observer sufficiently far tending towards infinity if you want but far from the  source basically we'll have a 4-velocity they'll have no spatial components so that's 0 0 0 and  the 4-velocity will just be C 0 0 0 now so there's our 4-velocity here is our 4-momentum components  here well when we take the scalar product of these two vectors or the inner product of these two  vectors what we're going to have the only components going to show up is a time component at the  beginning that's that minus a on C we already have a minus sign for that so we have minus  PT okay minus and then PT is minus a on C so there's two negatives there they cancel times  this C factor here we get a which is just the energy so what we found is the energy okay so  this is the this is the total energy of the particle and it will be conserved along the  geodesic followed by the particle okay because that deals with a time component there's a  killing vector in the time direction so energy be conserved throughout the all along the geodesic  so PT the covariant component of the momentum the covariant T component of the momentum sorry  times C is this object here which looks a bit familiar because that's what we found on the  previous page okay now these metric terms here are negative negative and so the left-hand side  would be negative and so it's necessary for this to be a minus a that's why on the previous page  previous slide sorry we had a negative a here and by doing that it as you can see it works out up  here because energy should be a positive quantity and so to do that we need to make this a negative  constant from from the previous slide it must be because if you look over here that's negative  GTT GT by the cross term is negative so the whole left-hand side of this is negative and we just  left it equal to a plus C that wouldn't make sense that be suggesting that the energy is a negative  quantity which it can't be and that's why I'm remaking this video actually because it's a  remake of the previous I'm replacing the old one all right now for the fourth coordinate X theta  is Phi so X dot 3 X dot 3 sorry third coordinate is Phi dot and DD lambda DL D Phi dot minus DL  D Phi L the Lagrangian is DD lambda and DL D Phi dot is this object here I can't show you  Lagrangian at the moment it's on the previous slide but we go in here this was a cross term  there was a Phi dot here we've differentiated with respect to that so that's gone and up here  there was a Phi dot squared hence the 2 has come out here okay now the Lagrangian was not a function  of Phi on its own so that term is 0 on the end here and all that's equal to 0 now what we have  here is DD lambda of this in the brackets here in the parentheses is equal to 0 now what I'm  going to do is divide through again by 2 to get rid of this factor here which came from the  differentiation up here and the 4 there so when I do that I get this which is the cross term GT Phi  G Phi T and this 2 here disappears so it becomes this is the metric term G Phi Phi okay and when  we a first integral of that is this object here equal to a constant and so we can now summarize  this is M on 2 times G Phi T times CT dot okay this one here is M on 2 G Phi Phi times Phi dot  so G Phi Phi here times Phi dot and that's equal to a constant constant H now this component the  particles for momentum is conserved along geodesics and there's another killing vector  in the direction of the Phi coordinate and so this is a conserved quantity along the geodesic  so particle following along the geodesic but only this component of full momentum is conserved the  total for momentum involves the other angular coordinate and the variables T and R and that  is not conserved the total angular momentum is not conserved remember there are no purely radial  paths in there these particles for momentum will change angular sorry this particles angular  momentum will change due to the inertial frame dragging effect okay so P Phi is MU Phi M on 2  G Phi T UT plus M on 2 G Phi Phi U Phi the metric here you can see these terms TT sums out and we're  left with U Phi Phi and a Phi here sum out we're left with U Phi lowered okay so PM U Phi now you  see why the halves were necessary for the Lagrange in the beginning it was necessary to put in the  halves there this makes sense M on 2 G Phi T CT dot so on is equal to constant H this component  of angular momentum this component is conserved along geodesics okay so we have two equations  now here they are all right now we can write this in matrix form because the next thing we'd like  to do is why not solve for CT dot and Phi dot the coordinates the first derivative of those coordinates  to help us find the fall velocity okay so we can express CT dot and Phi dot in terms of E and H  and the metric terms so let's write out the matrix here CT dot Phi dot and I'm just going to  compactify that into a single object a11 a12 a21 and a22 times that that's the metric that's the  matrix sorry matrix sorry that's the matrix times the vector CT dot Phi dot is minus EH  okay where the solutions of the form CT dot Phi dot is M inverse the inverse of this matrix here  multiplied with this vector minus EH now the determinant of M here the determinant of this  is a11 times a22 minus a12 a21 okay and when we do that using these terms here we'll have  M on 2 all squared times a factor of C and we will have this object here  now  we've seen this object before part of it anyway now the inverse  M inverse is 1 on the determinant times the adjoint of M and so 1 on the determinant is this  and the adjoint is this simply swapping these two terms along the diagonal and then the negative of  these two all right so filling all that out let's substitute in when we do all that put all these  terms in when we do that we get this 4 on CM squared and then the half there we can divide  we'll multiply 3 by 4 get rid of that we'll just have 2 a factor of 2 out front and then these  objects here okay factors of C and C here and CM here the M2 cancelled this one of the M's down  here so the solutions are CT dot phi dot is M inverse minus EH this object here times this  and writing them out line by line CT dot will be this object times that first row  here we go and phi dot will be this object here times the second row to give us this  all right next step now just note that from a previous video on the inverse metric for the  Kerr geometry in the metric in the Kerr metric series we found this object before to be this  and delta of course is this and so we can rewrite this as in this form here which would just be  handy in the next video and so on so writing out our solutions before we get CT dot is this object  here which is this okay because that 2 on CM all of this here just becomes minus 2 on CM delta  sine squared theta and then we'll just multiply 3 by sine squared theta so that'll simplify  that bit more minus 2 on CM delta times that and then phi dot writing that out  okay minus 2 on CM delta sine squared theta all of that there  okay and then again I will just leave that one as is actually there's  full stop later there now so far we have found the following components of the tangent vector  to a generalized geodesic where u mu is dx mu d lambda is CT dot and then we've yet to find  these two which we'll do in the next video and phi dot so we've got these two the zero term and  the third one or first and fourth and then next video we'll find the form of the equations of  motion for the other two coordinates r dot theta dot and they will be a bit more involved
