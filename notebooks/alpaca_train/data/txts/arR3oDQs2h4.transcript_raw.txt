 Hello! Welcome to Abbey's Phonics. Today we are going to be learning a new sound.  It is a digraph which means there are two letters that together they make one  sound and this digraph can actually make two sounds but we are going to only  learn one of them today. The letters in this sound are O and W or you might  know them as O and W. So when you see these two letters together they make the  O sound and when we say this sound you need to make your lips into the shape of  a circle and go like this O. Are you ready to practice? My turn, your turn.  O. O. O. O. O. O. O. Fantastic I love how you made the O sound. Let's see if we can  think of some words with this sound in. Can you think of any? What about when the  grass gets really long in our gardens and we have to go outside and we have to mow!  Are you ready? Let's see if we can hunt for the O sound. M-O, mow. Your turn. M-O, mow.  I love how you used all of your sounds. Let's think of another word with the O sound in.  Snails are very slow. Let's see if we can hunt for the O sound. S-O, slow. Your turn.  S-O, slow. Brilliant! The next word is something to do with flowers. Flowers need lots of water  so that they can grow. G-R-O, grow. G-R-O, grow. Well done! The next word is something that's  white and fluffy and very cold. That's it! Snow. S-O, snow. Your turn. S-O, snow.  Good job! The last word is something that we do when it's our birthday and we have a  cake with lots of candles on. We have to blow! Are you ready to use our sounds? B-L-O, blow.  Your turn. B-L-O, blow.  B-L-O, blow. Super! I love how you have used the O sound. Make sure you continue to practice this  one and then you can go on to learn all of the other sounds.
