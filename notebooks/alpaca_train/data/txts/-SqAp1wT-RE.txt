[00:00:00 -> 00:00:07]  So having taken a QLED approach to the opening statement and having explored
[00:00:07 -> 00:00:17]  the patient's thoughts, worries, hopes and the psychosocial impact, often the
[00:00:17 -> 00:00:24]  patient will have disclosed a situation that has been difficult for them,
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:34]  upsetting, painful, distressing. This is an opportunity to show sympathy or preferably
[00:00:35 -> 00:00:44]  empathy. Sympathy is the expression of sorrow for a patient's situation,
[00:00:45 -> 00:00:52]  for example, I'm really sorry to hear about your dad and his death.
[00:00:52 -> 00:01:00]  Sympathy does have some value in a consultation, it is showing that you're listening,
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:06]  it's showing you that you're a sympathetic person and therefore it can contribute
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:10]  to building or maintaining rapport.
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:19]  The way in which you do it is important, it's very important for the patient to actually
[00:01:19 -> 00:01:24]  finish what they're saying when they're describing the distressing situation.
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:31]  You've got to wait for that natural pause where you can come out with your sympathetic statement
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:40]  and most importantly, having done so, you must stop and allow the patient to acknowledge your
[00:01:40 -> 00:01:45]  sympathy. One of the things that I often hear when they're listening to recordings
[00:01:46 -> 00:01:54]  where trainees have realised that they need to show sympathy but under the pressure of time,
[00:01:54 -> 00:02:02]  it becomes gabbled and uncaring. So you'll hear something like, oh doctor and then dad died,
[00:02:02 -> 00:02:10]  it was such a terrible time. The patient starts crying and the GP then overtalks the crying
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:16]  patient, oh I'm very sorry to hear about your dad, so now let's just talk about your low back
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:25]  pain and how that's been affecting you. Of course this sounds uncaring, it's very much formulaic,
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:33]  it's not actually contributing anything to the consultation and may actually damage rapport.
[00:02:34 -> 00:02:43]  Empathy is actually more powerful than sympathy and it's used in the similar situations,
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:52]  but empathy is about you expressing your insight into the patient's situation
[00:02:52 -> 00:03:01]  and the impact it's having. So an example might be, gosh with your dad dying,
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:09]  I can really appreciate that's had a massive impact, not only for you but for your family.
[00:03:11 -> 00:03:17]  Again followed by the pause, allowing the patient to acknowledge that empathetic statement.
[00:03:18 -> 00:03:25]  What empathy is doing is showing that you really are listening to the patient, that you understand
[00:03:26 -> 00:03:36]  their situation and very powerfully contributes to the development and the maintenance of rapport.
[00:03:37 -> 00:03:43]  It's through that understanding or that perception of your understanding that
[00:03:43 -> 00:03:49]  is very much going to contribute to achieving a shared decision making.
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:58]  So we've mentioned rapport, so what does this really mean? It's about achieving a comfortable
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:06]  relationship with a patient within a consultation, such that the patient may feel able to disclose
[00:04:06 -> 00:04:12]  something that is painful, embarrassing, something that's difficult to talk about,
[00:04:13 -> 00:04:22]  that they wouldn't normally have mentioned. So how do you achieve it? Well you've got to think
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:30]  of it in terms of verbal and non-verbal approaches. In terms of the non-verbal approaches,
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:39]  it really begins as the patient walks through the door, the eye contact, the smile, the welcome,
[00:04:40 -> 00:04:47]  the open body posture, showing that you're actively listening to a patient,
[00:04:47 -> 00:04:53]  your facial expression conveying that you're interested in them and what's unfolding.
[00:04:55 -> 00:05:03]  Verbally, in terms of establishing rapport, it focuses about being interested in them and their
[00:05:04 -> 00:05:10]  situation and that often relates of course to that exploration of their thoughts,
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:17]  worries, hopes and psychosocial impact. It's about really listening to what they're saying,
[00:05:17 -> 00:05:28]  so cue handling becomes very important. It's about conveying your understanding of their situation
[00:05:28 -> 00:05:35]  and this is why empathy is so important. Of course, you've got to be taking a positive
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:44]  approach, such that the patient feels that you're on their side. Another thing to consider
[00:05:44 -> 00:05:50]  is that in terms of maintaining rapport, it's important not to surprise a patient.
[00:05:50 -> 00:06:01]  So always remember to signpost, explain why you're asking, explain why you're examining
[00:06:02 -> 00:06:09]  and through a patient feeling that you're interested in them, listening to them,
[00:06:10 -> 00:06:17]  understanding them and are out there to help them, are on their side, you're very much going to have
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:21]  that comfortable relationship that is rapport.
