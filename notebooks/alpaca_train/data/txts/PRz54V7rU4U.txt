[00:00:00 -> 00:00:08]  a way of life is under attack the patients are literally gasping
[00:00:09 -> 00:00:11]  It's us versus them
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:14]  Ford has veiled threats to use nuclear weapons
[00:00:14 -> 00:00:16]  They say he was using ankle beads to kill
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:18]  How do you say it?
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:22]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:34]  Liv, look at this
[00:00:34 -> 00:00:36]  Can you believe it?
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:38]  That is outrageous
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:42]  Quick, comment how stupid and awful he is
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:44]  People need to be reminded
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:46]  Okay
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:50]  Wait, what if this just gives him more attention?
[00:00:50 -> 00:00:52]  Who cares? He can't just get away with it
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:54]  True
[00:00:54 -> 00:00:56]  I just can't believe anyone is this ignorant
[00:00:56 -> 00:00:58]  Okay, so comment, let us know
[00:00:58 -> 00:01:02]  In fact, maybe do a quote tweet so your followers see it too
[00:01:02 -> 00:01:04]  So today I want to talk about rage
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:08]  Because doesn't it feel like everyone is going a little mad lately?
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:10]  Especially online
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:12]  I swear, every day some new thing comes up
[00:01:12 -> 00:01:14]  That might start out completely innocuous
[00:01:14 -> 00:01:18]  But will inevitably devolve into some politicized nightmare
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:20]  Of left versus right
[00:01:20 -> 00:01:22]  Trends and counter trends
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:26]  Where everyone is just screaming at each other through the digital void
[00:01:26 -> 00:01:28]  It's also miserable and hostile
[00:01:28 -> 00:01:30]  And yet, so weirdly addictive
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:34]  I've lost count of how many times I've got sucked into some online debate
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:36]  Even though I didn't even want to
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:40]  I even had to get one of these stupid safes to keep my phone in
[00:01:40 -> 00:01:44]  Because the online world is so ever-present and tempting
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:48]  It's almost like there's some insidious force acting through it
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:52]  Trying to get its hooks into my brain so I can go online and do its bidding
[00:01:52 -> 00:01:54]  You cannot hide
[00:01:54 -> 00:01:56]  And my personal issues aside
[00:01:56 -> 00:01:58]  I wanted to talk about this because
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:00]  Well frankly, this is getting really scary
[00:02:00 -> 00:02:04]  Because not only are we seeing more and more radicalization
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:06]  And civil unrest here at home
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:10]  But this is increasingly starting to affect our chances of solving
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:13]  These really big global coordination problems
[00:02:13 -> 00:02:17]  Like climate change and pandemics and arms races
[00:02:17 -> 00:02:19]  Which require us to come together to solve
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:22]  And instead we're getting torn more and more apart
[00:02:22 -> 00:02:25]  So what the hell is going on?
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:29]  Are we acting this way because everything really is falling apart
[00:02:29 -> 00:02:32]  Or is it more that our perception of the world is getting twisted
[00:02:32 -> 00:02:34]  Which is making us crazy
[00:02:34 -> 00:02:37]  And then sort of turning this all into a big self-fulfilling prophecy
[00:02:37 -> 00:02:39]  Well as always, the answer is far from simple
[00:02:39 -> 00:02:42]  Because it's certainly true that there are plenty of individuals out there
[00:02:42 -> 00:02:44]  Who are directly profiting from all this drama
[00:02:44 -> 00:02:48]  But the thing is, there's something even deeper at play here
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:53]  A force far more reckless than any one individual company
[00:02:53 -> 00:02:58]  A force so powerful it can infect an entire industry
[00:02:58 -> 00:03:01]  And turn that industry from one of our greatest tools
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:03]  Into one of our greatest threats
[00:03:14 -> 00:03:16]  Whether it's the Matrix or the Terminator
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:19]  At this point we're all pretty familiar with the trope of
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:22]  Humans naively building a powerful machine to serve them
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:25]  But then the machine takes over and makes them serve it
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:28]  You have 20 seconds to comply
[00:03:28 -> 00:03:30]  Movies have been telling this story for years
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:33]  In fact, it dates all the way back to 1927
[00:03:33 -> 00:03:35]  In the silent film called Metropolis
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:40]  Metropolis tells the story of this futuristic, seemingly utopian city
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:42]  That seems great on the surface
[00:03:42 -> 00:03:44]  Until we learn that deep underground
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:47]  There's a huge machine which demands the blood, sweat and tears
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:50]  Of poor workers in order to keep everything running
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:52]  Pretty dark stuff for the time
[00:03:52 -> 00:03:54]  And remarkably prophetic
[00:03:54 -> 00:03:56]  Given that it was written nearly 100 years ago
[00:03:56 -> 00:03:59]  And that today we are increasingly at the mercy
[00:03:59 -> 00:04:02]  Of a giant machine of our own creation
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:06]  Except that instead of cogs, ours is made of bits
[00:04:06 -> 00:04:10]  And instead of feeding on flesh, it feeds on our attention
[00:04:11 -> 00:04:14]  That's right folks, I'm talking about our media industry
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:18]  Which of course up close is made up of lots of individual people
[00:04:18 -> 00:04:20]  But from a zoomed out view
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:24]  Essentially functions as this giant digitised attention processing machine
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:28]  That our species built in order to spread its news information
[00:04:28 -> 00:04:30]  More efficiently around the globe
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:32]  And back in the pre-internet days
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:35]  The machine was really just a small number of companies
[00:04:35 -> 00:04:37]  That kind of controlled all the news flow
[00:04:37 -> 00:04:39]  In a very centralised power structure
[00:04:39 -> 00:04:42]  And of course nowadays we have social media too
[00:04:42 -> 00:04:44]  As well as those old legacy companies
[00:04:44 -> 00:04:46]  And so it's become this curious combination
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:48]  Of both top-down broadcasts
[00:04:48 -> 00:04:51]  And bottom-up user-generated content
[00:04:51 -> 00:04:53]  Both kind of feeding into each other
[00:04:53 -> 00:04:55]  While everyone competes in a giant game
[00:04:55 -> 00:04:57]  Of who can win the most attention
[00:04:58 -> 00:05:01]  But this doesn't inherently have to be a bad thing, right?
[00:05:01 -> 00:05:05]  Like machines have made our lives so much better over the years
[00:05:05 -> 00:05:10]  As has capitalism, which is ultimately driven by this competitive process
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:13]  So in theory, having a highly data-driven
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:15]  Competitive media ecosystem
[00:05:15 -> 00:05:17]  Should allow the cream to rise to the top
[00:05:17 -> 00:05:20]  So that only the most high-quality information
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:22]  Is what ends up getting spread
[00:05:22 -> 00:05:24]  And yet, here we are
[00:05:24 -> 00:05:26]  So where the hell is it all going wrong?
[00:05:26 -> 00:05:29]  Again, those Metropolis writers were strangely insightful
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:33]  Because in that scene where the underground machine is first revealed
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:35]  The film's protagonist has a sudden vision
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:37]  That there is something even deeper
[00:05:37 -> 00:05:39]  And more malevolent controlling it
[00:05:39 -> 00:05:42]  Almost like something demonic has taken hold of it
[00:05:42 -> 00:05:45]  A monster that consumes its victims as a sacrifice
[00:05:45 -> 00:05:47]  In exchange for power
[00:05:47 -> 00:05:50]  And the name of that monster is Moloch
[00:05:55 -> 00:05:58]  Now the legend of Moloch originally comes from a Bible story
[00:05:58 -> 00:06:03]  About this war-obsessed cult who are so desperate for victory
[00:06:03 -> 00:06:06]  They sacrifice their literal children to it
[00:06:06 -> 00:06:08]  In exchange for military power
[00:06:08 -> 00:06:09]  Awful stuff
[00:06:09 -> 00:06:14]  But these days, it's better known as the god of unhealthy competition
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:16]  In other words, the force of bad incentives
[00:06:16 -> 00:06:19]  Where players in a game end up sacrificing
[00:06:19 -> 00:06:21]  More and more of their other values
[00:06:21 -> 00:06:23]  In order to get a short-term advantage
[00:06:23 -> 00:06:26]  Which forces all their competitors to do the same thing
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:28]  But then everyone ends up worse off than before
[00:06:28 -> 00:06:31]  So like when businesses cut corners on environmental protections
[00:06:31 -> 00:06:33]  To boost profits
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:35]  Or like when athletes give in to illegal doping
[00:06:35 -> 00:06:37]  Because they feel like all their competitors are doing it anyway
[00:06:37 -> 00:06:42]  Or when countries pour more and more of their GDP into military defence
[00:06:42 -> 00:06:44]  Because otherwise they'll be left vulnerable to their enemies
[00:06:44 -> 00:06:46]  And if you saw my video The Beauty Wars
[00:06:46 -> 00:06:49]  You'll remember how I covered myself in face filters
[00:06:49 -> 00:06:52]  To explain how these same Moloch-y forces
[00:06:52 -> 00:06:55]  Are driving this epidemic of body dysmorphia
[00:06:55 -> 00:06:57]  On various social media platforms
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:00]  But seeing as today we're talking about the whole media industry itself
[00:07:00 -> 00:07:02]  Allow me to introduce you to our new star
[00:07:02 -> 00:07:04]  The Media Moloch
[00:07:08 -> 00:07:13]  Good afternoon and welcome to Look At This News
[00:07:13 -> 00:07:16]  Now we've got a lot of stories lined up for you today
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:18]  Although first, let me just say
[00:07:18 -> 00:07:19]  Live
[00:07:19 -> 00:07:22]  Just because a bunch of teenagers are too dumb to realise
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:25]  That staring at Kardashianified versions of themselves all day long
[00:07:25 -> 00:07:27]  Is going to be bad for them
[00:07:27 -> 00:07:30]  Doesn't mean the same thing applies to all the good folks out there
[00:07:30 -> 00:07:33]  Who are just trying to keep themselves educated on world events
[00:07:33 -> 00:07:35]  They are just being responsible
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:38]  And my media company is just keeping them informed
[00:07:38 -> 00:07:40]  Well, perhaps that would be true
[00:07:40 -> 00:07:42]  If you guys painted an accurate picture of the world
[00:07:42 -> 00:07:44]  But that's not your goal, is it Moloch?
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:47]  Otherwise you wouldn't be putting such an inflammatory spin on every damn story
[00:07:47 -> 00:07:50]  So you're clearly optimising for something else
[00:07:50 -> 00:07:52]  The world is falling apart out there
[00:07:52 -> 00:07:55]  And you're saying that we're overblowing it?
[00:07:55 -> 00:07:57]  Sounds like you're the evil one
[00:07:57 -> 00:08:02]  Yes, obviously there are countless awful things happening every single day
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:04]  As has always been the case throughout history
[00:08:04 -> 00:08:07]  But there are so many positive things happening all the time too
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:10]  Random acts of kindness, disease eradication
[00:08:10 -> 00:08:12]  Where are all your stories about those?
[00:08:12 -> 00:08:15]  Like, I can go scroll through any major news outlet
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:17]  Across the political spectrum
[00:08:17 -> 00:08:21]  And the ratio of negative to positive stories is just absurd
[00:08:21 -> 00:08:24]  Like, why not just show a little more balance?
[00:08:24 -> 00:08:25]  Well, we all know why
[00:08:25 -> 00:08:27]  Because bad news sells better
[00:08:27 -> 00:08:30]  And the media have been capitalising on the negativity bias
[00:08:30 -> 00:08:32]  Well, since the dawn of the printing press
[00:08:32 -> 00:08:35]  In fact, here's a study that measures the tone of world events
[00:08:35 -> 00:08:38]  As they've been reported by Wikipedia
[00:08:38 -> 00:08:41]  You can see the very clearly rough times during the major world wars
[00:08:41 -> 00:08:44]  But aside of that, the vibe has trended pretty positively
[00:08:44 -> 00:08:46]  Since the end of World War II
[00:08:46 -> 00:08:50]  But according to the media, things have gotten more negative over that time
[00:08:50 -> 00:08:52]  So someone is clearly getting it wrong
[00:08:52 -> 00:08:55]  And if I had to guess whose reporting is more accurate
[00:08:55 -> 00:08:58]  Media companies, whose primary goal is to win eyeballs
[00:08:58 -> 00:09:00]  To keep their shareholders happy
[00:09:00 -> 00:09:03]  Versus the hive mind of thousands of Wikipedia historians
[00:09:03 -> 00:09:05]  Well, I know who I'm betting on
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:09]  Okay, so we focus on the negative stuff a little more than we should
[00:09:09 -> 00:09:12]  But no one cares about good news
[00:09:12 -> 00:09:14]  And look how many shares all my stories are getting
[00:09:14 -> 00:09:17]  I'm clearly just giving the people what they want
[00:09:17 -> 00:09:19]  Yeah, but are you actually?
[00:09:19 -> 00:09:23]  Because, like, we know people can get sucked into addiction or into cults
[00:09:23 -> 00:09:25]  You know, down social media rabbit holes
[00:09:25 -> 00:09:29]  And the trouble is, we tend to assume it only ever happens to other people
[00:09:29 -> 00:09:32]  It's really hard to spot when we're the ones being manipulated
[00:09:32 -> 00:09:34]  But we really are
[00:09:34 -> 00:09:36]  And it's not just by sketchy social media algorithms
[00:09:36 -> 00:09:38]  Trying to get us hooked on their feeds either
[00:09:38 -> 00:09:41]  The legacy media are absolutely at it too
[00:09:41 -> 00:09:44]  Like on Google, the New York Times' project Feels, for starters
[00:09:44 -> 00:09:46]  Which uses advanced data science techniques
[00:09:46 -> 00:09:48]  To predict emotional responses to their articles
[00:09:48 -> 00:09:52]  So that their advertisers can better serve ads according to people's moods
[00:09:52 -> 00:09:55]  And then, of course, there's the awkward fact
[00:09:55 -> 00:09:58]  That news media directly profits from political tension
[00:09:58 -> 00:10:01]  Like, no one boosted the profits of both the right wing
[00:10:01 -> 00:10:04]  And the left wing news outlets more than Trump
[00:10:04 -> 00:10:06]  Even though half of them claim they hated him
[00:10:06 -> 00:10:08]  So no wonder polarisation is getting worse
[00:10:08 -> 00:10:11]  Your attention game is getting more competitive than ever
[00:10:11 -> 00:10:14]  And our anger is the cash cow keeping half your companies alive
[00:10:14 -> 00:10:18]  But your species have so many human emotions
[00:10:18 -> 00:10:21]  Why is it always angry tribalism you fall into?
[00:10:21 -> 00:10:24]  Yeah, well, we do normally have quite a nice wide range of emotions
[00:10:24 -> 00:10:27]  The thing is, we don't just read our news anymore
[00:10:27 -> 00:10:29]  We interact with it
[00:10:29 -> 00:10:32]  And we've built these incredibly powerful
[00:10:32 -> 00:10:34]  But also really dumb algorithms
[00:10:34 -> 00:10:37]  That are simply designed to just maximise engagement no matter what
[00:10:37 -> 00:10:40]  And it seems like anger is like rocket fuel for that
[00:10:40 -> 00:10:42]  Because it's not only a negative emotion
[00:10:42 -> 00:10:45]  It's also a very active one that triggers us into action
[00:10:45 -> 00:10:47]  You know, to go and defend our tribe
[00:10:47 -> 00:10:50]  And so it gets amplified way beyond how people would naturally behave
[00:10:50 -> 00:10:52]  Yes, but we need all this delicious anger
[00:10:52 -> 00:10:55]  We've got inequality and climate change
[00:10:55 -> 00:10:59]  Pandemics, lying, self-serving politicians
[00:10:59 -> 00:11:01]  Doesn't it just make you furious?
[00:11:01 -> 00:11:03]  Of course it does
[00:11:03 -> 00:11:06]  But these are insanely complex coordination problems
[00:11:06 -> 00:11:09]  That are already at the limits of our collective intelligence
[00:11:09 -> 00:11:11]  So they need us to be calm and rational
[00:11:11 -> 00:11:13]  And work together to solve them
[00:11:13 -> 00:11:16]  And instead we're getting whipped into this rabid frenzy
[00:11:16 -> 00:11:18]  By both arms of the media machine
[00:11:18 -> 00:11:20]  We've got algorithms whose crappy design
[00:11:20 -> 00:11:22]  Act like some kind of heat-seeking missile
[00:11:22 -> 00:11:24]  For the most divisive, insane opinions
[00:11:24 -> 00:11:26]  And then we've got an increasingly desperate
[00:11:26 -> 00:11:28]  And click-baity legacy media
[00:11:28 -> 00:11:30]  Whose journalists now source more and more of their stories
[00:11:30 -> 00:11:33]  From social media in a kind of feedback loop from hell
[00:11:33 -> 00:11:35]  And meanwhile you, through your machine
[00:11:35 -> 00:11:37]  Grow ever more powerful by the day
[00:11:37 -> 00:11:39]  As you perversely use us to go out and document
[00:11:39 -> 00:11:41]  The worst events on earth
[00:11:41 -> 00:11:43]  And then mainline them straight back into our limbic systems
[00:11:43 -> 00:11:45]  In 4K 24-7
[00:11:45 -> 00:11:47]  Essentially reducing our glorious species
[00:11:47 -> 00:11:50]  Into a mindless factory farm of rage-porn junkies
[00:11:50 -> 00:11:53]  For apparently no reason but maximising third-party advertising dollars
[00:11:53 -> 00:11:55]  Until we all fucking kill each other!
[00:12:06 -> 00:12:08]  So, there we go
[00:12:08 -> 00:12:10]  First thing I want to say is
[00:12:10 -> 00:12:12]  I don't have some kind of vendetta
[00:12:12 -> 00:12:14]  Against all media people
[00:12:14 -> 00:12:16]  Or all journalists
[00:12:16 -> 00:12:18]  In fact, it's kind of a quirk of the English language
[00:12:18 -> 00:12:20]  That we use the same word to describe someone
[00:12:20 -> 00:12:22]  Who literally risks their life
[00:12:22 -> 00:12:24]  Reporting from a war zone
[00:12:24 -> 00:12:26]  As a click-bait peddler
[00:12:26 -> 00:12:28]  Who's just optimising for whatever
[00:12:28 -> 00:12:30]  The most profitable spin of the day is
[00:12:30 -> 00:12:32]  But even then, those guys
[00:12:32 -> 00:12:34]  Are often forced to write that way
[00:12:34 -> 00:12:36]  By their editors
[00:12:36 -> 00:12:38]  And their editors are told what narratives to push
[00:12:38 -> 00:12:40]  By their bosses
[00:12:40 -> 00:12:42]  Who are all beholden to their shareholders
[00:12:42 -> 00:12:44]  All trapped in Moloch's web
[00:12:44 -> 00:12:47]  And while that doesn't absolve any of them
[00:12:47 -> 00:12:49]  From their individual responsibility
[00:12:49 -> 00:12:51]  We have to remember that
[00:12:51 -> 00:12:53]  It is the real enemy here
[00:12:53 -> 00:12:55]  Not any individual member of the media
[00:12:55 -> 00:12:57]  And certainly not one another
[00:12:57 -> 00:12:59]  Although now you're probably thinking
[00:12:59 -> 00:13:01]  Ah, so Moloch is capitalism
[00:13:01 -> 00:13:03]  No, it's certainly something
[00:13:03 -> 00:13:05]  That can act through capitalism
[00:13:05 -> 00:13:07]  But it's much more fundamental
[00:13:07 -> 00:13:09]  Than any kind of economic structure
[00:13:09 -> 00:13:11]  Because it's a force of game theory
[00:13:11 -> 00:13:13]  Another way you can think of it
[00:13:13 -> 00:13:15]  Is as a sort of personification
[00:13:15 -> 00:13:17]  Of that mindless force
[00:13:17 -> 00:13:19]  Of disharmony
[00:13:19 -> 00:13:21]  That causes a cell to turn cancerous
[00:13:21 -> 00:13:23]  It's the mindset of
[00:13:23 -> 00:13:25]  Winning for winning's sake
[00:13:25 -> 00:13:27]  At the cost of everything else
[00:13:27 -> 00:13:29]  So then, how do we get Moloch out of our media?
[00:13:29 -> 00:13:31]  Well, there's no easy answer
[00:13:31 -> 00:13:33]  To that question, unfortunately
[00:13:33 -> 00:13:35]  Otherwise, we probably would have done it already
[00:13:35 -> 00:13:37]  But there is some hope
[00:13:37 -> 00:13:39]  Because it needs two sort of key ingredients
[00:13:39 -> 00:13:41]  In order to thrive
[00:13:41 -> 00:13:43]  Firstly, it needs a poorly designed
[00:13:43 -> 00:13:45]  Competitive system
[00:13:45 -> 00:13:47]  And then secondly, it needs
[00:13:47 -> 00:13:49]  A minimum number of individuals within that system
[00:13:49 -> 00:13:51]  Who are unable to resist
[00:13:51 -> 00:13:53]  Its bad incentives
[00:13:53 -> 00:13:55]  Now with the first one, well luckily right now
[00:13:55 -> 00:13:57]  There's some opportunity to redesign social media
[00:13:57 -> 00:13:59]  Algorithms away from divisiveness
[00:13:59 -> 00:14:01]  And rage, and more towards
[00:14:01 -> 00:14:03]  Better sense-making and information
[00:14:03 -> 00:14:05]  And just generally making them more fun
[00:14:05 -> 00:14:07]  And as for the second one
[00:14:07 -> 00:14:09]  Well, that's on all of us, right?
[00:14:09 -> 00:14:11]  Because our consumption habits
[00:14:11 -> 00:14:13]  Directly shape the type of content
[00:14:13 -> 00:14:15]  That gets made in the first place
[00:14:15 -> 00:14:17]  And one way I've personally found helpful
[00:14:17 -> 00:14:19]  Is to start muting, or at least
[00:14:19 -> 00:14:21]  Ignoring anyone
[00:14:21 -> 00:14:23]  Particularly any politicians
[00:14:23 -> 00:14:25]  Who build the majority of their personal brand
[00:14:25 -> 00:14:27]  Around attacking the other side
[00:14:27 -> 00:14:29]  You know, pointing out what's wrong with the bad guys
[00:14:29 -> 00:14:31]  Without offering any more productive
[00:14:31 -> 00:14:33]  Better solutions
[00:14:33 -> 00:14:35]  Because if someone's whole thing is about just
[00:14:35 -> 00:14:37]  Tearing others down, then it's just
[00:14:37 -> 00:14:39]  More repetition of the Moloch mindset
[00:14:39 -> 00:14:41]  You know, this zero-sum-ness that is so destructive
[00:14:41 -> 00:14:43]  Also, I really love this Perception Gap website
[00:14:43 -> 00:14:45]  Which runs surveys and polls
[00:14:45 -> 00:14:47]  To measure what Democrats and Republicans
[00:14:47 -> 00:14:49]  Actually think about an issue
[00:14:49 -> 00:14:51]  But then also what they think the other side
[00:14:51 -> 00:14:53]  Think about that same issue
[00:14:53 -> 00:14:55]  And lo and behold, there is a big gap
[00:14:55 -> 00:14:57]  In what those two things are
[00:14:57 -> 00:14:59]  In other words, the average person's views
[00:14:59 -> 00:15:01]  On both sides are much closer
[00:15:01 -> 00:15:03]  Than what the media machine has led everyone to believe
[00:15:03 -> 00:15:05]  And then of course
[00:15:05 -> 00:15:07]  There's the tried and tested technique
[00:15:07 -> 00:15:09]  Of steelmanning the other side
[00:15:09 -> 00:15:11]  Steelmanning the other side
[00:15:11 -> 00:15:13]  Is the latest breakthrough in cognitive technology
[00:15:13 -> 00:15:15]  To help those suffering
[00:15:15 -> 00:15:17]  From algorithmically amplified
[00:15:17 -> 00:15:19]  Rage and hatred
[00:15:19 -> 00:15:21]  Listen to your doctor
[00:15:21 -> 00:15:23]  And if any of you guys
[00:15:23 -> 00:15:25]  Have any techniques you've personally found helpful
[00:15:25 -> 00:15:27]  At reducing your own online rage
[00:15:27 -> 00:15:29]  Please share them below in the comments
