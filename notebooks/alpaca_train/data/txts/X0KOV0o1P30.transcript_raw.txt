 rules of thumb that I'd like you to take away from this. First, don't have debt  rise faster than income because your debt burdens will eventually crush you.  Second, don't have income rise faster than productivity because you'll  eventually become uncompetitive. And third, do all that you can to raise your  productivity because in the long run that's what matters most. This is simple  advice for you and it's simple advice for policy makers. You might be surprised  but most people, including most policy makers, don't pay enough attention to  this. This template has worked for me and I hope it will work for you.
