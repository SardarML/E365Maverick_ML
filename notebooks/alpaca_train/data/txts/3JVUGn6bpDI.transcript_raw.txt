Alaka na ng pimple ko.  So anyway.  He's doing his report there.  While I'm going to study here.  That's what I always do.  I always start with the codals.  Whenever you study you start with the codals.  Then the book.  And then you go on to your cases.  My cases are online right now.  All my cases are online now.  I use goodnotes.  I like my pdfs.

Like the whole imposter syndrome.  You won't feel like you're smart enough to be here.  You start to double think if I'm really worthy to be in law school.  I struggled with that my whole 4 years.  It was always reflecting.  And then after reflecting making another decision.  It's like love.  Siguro I can warn you.  That you will for sure.  Well not for sure.  But most likely.  There will be times.  When you question.  Whether it's worth it.  Whether you're cut out.  Whether you'll forever be an imposter.  Don't beat yourself up too much.  For repeating that.  You're just persons built like that.  You just have to go through that experience.  And process it.  And make that commitment again.  Hey guys. Finally done with class.  So.  We're going to have dinner.  But he's still sleeping.  He'll wake up.  Let's eat.  Blah blah.  And so we're gonna order.  What do you want?  What do you want?  I don't know.  I don't know.  What do you want?  I don't know.  Here we go again.  You babe.  What do you want?  I don't know.  I'll just say it.  And then you answer it.  Huh? What?  You want to answer it too.  No. I swear. I won't say anything.  What do you want?  Give me your phone.  I'll do it.  Okay.  You love me?  Nice.  So while he's ordering.  The daily life.  They grind.  The daily grind.  That's what they always say in law school.  To appreciate daily grind.  Everyday. It's gonna be hard.  So.  Yeah. And after class.  Study again. And then the next day.  It's the same thing.  But you just have to take it one day at a time.  Right?  That's right.  So we're just going to eat.  And then I'll rest first.  Because I'm tired.  My head hurts.  Everytime there's online class.  And I just stare at the monitor.  It really hurts.  This is so expensive.  Who is this?  So.  We'll see you guys later.  When we get our food.  Bye.  Since we're waiting for the food.  And I'm bored.  I will TikTok.  Okay guys.  So our food is here.  We're gonna eat now.  Hi baby cookie.  We're gonna eat now.  We have Frankie.  Okay guys.  We're going to eat now.  Okay guys.  We're going to eat now.  Okay bye.  Okay guys.  We're finished.  Taking a break.  We watched a movie.  So now.  Study na.  Study na?  Yeah.  We're going to study now.  So.  Let's study.  Bye bye.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Study na baby.  Hello.  Hi guys.  So today we'll be studying for CRIM.  I study for CRIM.  I start with the codals.  So underline.  And then highlight the codals.  Green.  Specifically for the general rule.  Orange for the exceptions.  Pink for the titles.  Yellow for enumeration.  Underline for important details.  So we start with the codal as always.  And then you read the book.  So you can understand it.  And the third is when you read the case.  So you have a full grasp of everything.  For CRIM kasi it's important for the cases and then the people.  So what I do is.  I draw stick figures.  I draw a storyboard.  For me to remember the cases.  So that's what I do for CRIM.  And since CRIM is super hard with memorization.  Especially with the elements.  What I do is.  I make flashcards online.  I use Quizlet.  To put all the enumerations and everything.  And after that.  I test myself.  And additionally.  To make sure I memorize everything talaga.  For the provisions.  The articles.  I put them on my wall.  So I remember all the articles.  All the elements.  Kasi for me CRIM talaga is the hardest.  When it comes to the provisions.  Every literal word matters.  And for CRIM you only take it first year.  And then you take it again I think fourth year.  So for the bar.  Usually CRIM is the hardest.  So by now.  You have to put it in your hearts.  So I'll study CRIM na.  And then.  He's studying.  What are you studying?  Pediatrics.  Write hypochondrium.  What is a hypochondrium?  Sabi niya internal myolysis.  Ano yung tinamaan sa kanya?  Left or right?  Ano?  Yung infection niya.  Hindi ko na maalala.  Three pages ago na yun.  May divisions.  May partitions na abdominal area.  Ayan yung hypochondrium.  We have the left.  We have the right.  Patay ka talaga diyan.  Depends.  Yung tumagot sa laksa mo na.  Yung motoraxe mo yun.  Yung buhay yan.  Pwede ka naman mabuhay  ng isang lang.  Ng isa lang.  O dalawa.  Dalawa lang?  Oh my god.  This slow student.  While  undergoing medical treatment,  the victim took out the drainage  from his wound and as a result,  he died.  Docu's claimed as a defense that  had not the disease taken out the drainage,  he would not have died.  Pwede patatanggalin yung drainage.  I mean, ba't patatanggal  ng patient yung drainage?  Ba't patatanggalin yung drainage?  Baka siguro yung nabagsa.  Nakikita niya lumalabas sa drainage.  Ayan yung kinabata niya.  Infection.  Feeling ko infection or  baka pwede yung  peritonitis.  Ayan, infection.  Okay.  Wanted.  Ano yung tarpauling?  That's nice.  Okay, guys. Time check.  What time is it?  I don't know.  We just finished studying.  It's the end of the day for us.
