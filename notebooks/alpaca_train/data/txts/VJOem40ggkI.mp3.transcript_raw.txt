 In part one I made the spindle and frame of the attachment and explained a bit  about the theory of gear hobbing. If you haven't seen part one this will probably  make more sense if you go back and watch that first. The spindle is driven by a  stepper motor via a toothed belt and pulleys. The large pulley needs to be  keyed to the spindle.  You  need to make a nut for the end of the spindle.
