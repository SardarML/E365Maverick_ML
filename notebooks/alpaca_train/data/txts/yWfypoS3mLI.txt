[00:00:00 -> 00:00:12]  G'day and welcome back to a Wimbledon video. This is for legal studies. It's a legal studies
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:20]  teacher reads the news. Looking today at how we can incorporate a contemporary issue into
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:25]  the preliminary course and specifically I'm looking at part three here, the law in practice.
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:31]  This is a unit that's often kind of integrated in to the other two units. So you'll see here
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:35]  the law and practice unit can be integrated to part one or two or treated as a separate unit.
[00:00:35 -> 00:00:42]  I often like to separate them out and look at something kind of in a kind of complete
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:49]  picture of, for example, law reform. We'll do a bit of law reform and we'll do lockout laws.
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:53]  And so we've already done law reform as the unit part two and then part three we see it
[00:00:54 -> 00:01:00]  as a whole unit and we look at lockout laws as that. But often what happens in legal studies
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:05]  I find is that an issue comes to the table and we'll look at it in a class. And so this is an
[00:01:05 -> 00:01:10]  example where you might do like a little micro unit. You might look at a lesson or two lessons
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:16]  at an issue that is occurring as we speak. And this happened the other day when the Sydney
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:26]  trains decided to not run. So it's the 21st of February 2022 and commuters get to the station
[00:01:26 -> 00:01:31]  early or find out from the news that all of a sudden the trains aren't running. Now this causes
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:38]  absolute chaos because of the day that it was. It was the first day that they had eased restrictions
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:42]  of COVID in office buildings. So they're hoping a whole bunch of people would come into the CBD.
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:47]  It was the first day of international travellers coming in from overseas. So a whole bunch of
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:52]  transport required there. People trying to get to the airport. It was also the first day of uni going
[00:01:52 -> 00:01:59]  back and school as well. A whole bunch of people obviously going to school. So it really was kind
[00:01:59 -> 00:02:07]  of a combination of a whole bunch of things. And what we're seeing is the main transport system
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:13]  of New South Wales, specifically Sydney, just not running. And looking at these first couple of
[00:02:13 -> 00:02:21]  photos we see all of this. The station is closed. All train services have been suspended. Customers
[00:02:21 -> 00:02:25]  urged to avoid travel where possible. Use alternative mode of transport and allow extra
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:30]  travel time on other modes of transport. Now something like this has happened before. So
[00:02:30 -> 00:02:36]  why was so much chaos caused this time? The answer is people didn't know it was going to happen.
[00:02:37 -> 00:02:41]  So it's all well and good saying use alternative mode of transport. But if you rock up at the
[00:02:41 -> 00:02:47]  station and you had no idea you needed to use alternative modes of transport, then you're in a
[00:02:47 -> 00:02:55]  bit of a bother. It was raining. It was not a great day for it. And so here you see people stranded,
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:04]  closed, waiting for buses, these kind of things coming up. And you'll note due to industrial action
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:13]  due to industrial action. There it is. So what's happening here? What are we what are we talking
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:20]  about? What is the issue? Well if we're looking at it from a syllabus point of view, this is a
[00:03:20 -> 00:03:25]  challenge. It's a contemporary issue that has occurred and we want to have a think about it
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:29]  in relation to what are the themes and challenges that can be incorporated into this topic.
[00:03:29 -> 00:03:35]  So for example the responsiveness of the legal system in dealing with issues and we'll see where
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:39]  that comes from. And the effectiveness of legal and non-legal mechanisms in achieving justice.
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:43]  Now that sounds a bit flawed, achieving justice. What I'm basically talking about here is the idea
[00:03:43 -> 00:03:48]  that the legal system is supposed to work in a certain way so that the society can function.
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:55]  And that hasn't happened in this case. So if we're looking at it, we're thinking about here's a good
[00:03:55 -> 00:03:59]  example where we can quickly have a go at evaluating the effectiveness of the legal response
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:06]  to this issue. And the issue is industrial action. The issue is disagreement between those
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:14]  running the trains and between the workers. And initially throughout the day what we had
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:21]  was the Prime Minister and the Premier basically blaming the union, the Rail and Train Bus Union,
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:29]  RTBU, and basically saying that they had decided to do action and city trains had no choice.
[00:04:29 -> 00:04:36]  Because of this action that was undertaken they had to stop the trains. Now how much of that was
[00:04:36 -> 00:04:43]  accurate? That's the question that we want to ask ourselves. And we hear from Seema Crystal here,
[00:04:43 -> 00:04:50]  she's a Professor of Labor Law at, where is she from? Deputy Head of School and Deputy Dean of
[00:04:50 -> 00:04:58]  the University of Sydney Law School. And she's here to basically give her opinion on this claim
[00:04:58 -> 00:05:02]  that it was the fault of the union for the industrial action. Let's have a read of what
[00:05:02 -> 00:05:08]  she's going to say here. On Monday morning Sydney woke up to public transport chaos. Train networks
[00:05:08 -> 00:05:12]  closed down and a war of words between the government, city trains, and the unions over
[00:05:12 -> 00:05:18]  the blame for this purported strike action. During the day it became clear the chaos stemmed not from
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:24]  strike action but from a management decision to shut down the train network because of its
[00:05:24 -> 00:05:29]  concerns that planned protected industrial action by the union would make the train network unsafe
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:36]  to run. Okay, fair enough. We're still in this, it's industrial action. We're still in this idea
[00:05:36 -> 00:05:40]  and just because the decision was made by management that makes it sound like they didn't
[00:05:40 -> 00:05:49]  have a choice. She disagrees. Yet in January 2018 Dominic PerretÃ©, as then New South Wales Minister
[00:05:49 -> 00:05:55]  for Industrial Relations, sought and obtained an order under section 424 of the Fair Work Act
[00:05:55 -> 00:06:02]  in the Fair Work Commission suspending proposed protected industrial action by the same union
[00:06:02 -> 00:06:06]  citing the desire to avoid the very same chaos that just ended on Monday.
[00:06:07 -> 00:06:12]  That proposed protected industrial action involving an overtime ban and 24-hour work
[00:06:12 -> 00:06:19]  stoppage was suspended on the basis that it posed a threat to the welfare, life, health, and safety of
[00:06:19 -> 00:06:26]  the population of Sydney and threatened to damage the economy. In other words, the Premier back when
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:32]  he was in charge of industrial relations said this strike action you're planning is too dangerous
[00:06:32 -> 00:06:37]  and therefore he went to the Fair Work Commission and this is why it's one of the mechanisms we have
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:43]  and basically said to the judge we need to ban this and he was
[00:06:45 -> 00:06:50]  awarded the decision. In his decision Senior Deputy President Jonathan Hamburger relied on
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:54]  evidence presented by the New South Wales Government that the proposed action threatened
[00:06:54 -> 00:06:58]  the welfare of New South Wales commuters including affecting students, those attending hospital, etc
[00:06:59 -> 00:07:05]  and it would cost 90 million dollars. Now just four years later it appears that rather than
[00:07:05 -> 00:07:10]  urgently seeking similar orders under section 424 of the Fair Work Act suspending the proposed
[00:07:10 -> 00:07:15]  industrial action, management and the New South Wales Government opted to shut down the entire
[00:07:15 -> 00:07:21]  transport network. So Shea's asking you to ask yourself now why didn't they do the
[00:07:21 -> 00:07:28]  same thing again? If it was such a threat why shut it down with no notice whatsoever
[00:07:29 -> 00:07:33]  and not take the action that you've already successfully taken years ago?
[00:07:34 -> 00:07:39]  If as been claimed loudly by the media the proposed protected industrial action posed such a threat
[00:07:39 -> 00:07:43]  to the safety of commuters on the Sydney Rail network that it necessitated shutting down the
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:48]  network entirely, why weren't these claims put to the test before the Commission on Sunday night
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:54]  in the urgent hearing listed at the request of Sydney Trains? So they literally had the same
[00:07:54 -> 00:08:01]  hearing on the night before and did not put those claims that were successful last time to the test.
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:07]  The rules Shea says around protected industrial action under the Fair Work Act are complex.
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:11]  In essence the provisions allow for a level of industrial rough and tumble in the form of
[00:08:11 -> 00:08:18]  protected industrial action. For employees this can span a range of conduct from refusing to wear
[00:08:18 -> 00:08:24]  work uniforms or overtime or other bans right through to a total refusal to work or a strike
[00:08:24 -> 00:08:29]  in the traditional sense. For management this includes the right to respond to such action
[00:08:29 -> 00:08:34]  by employees through a lockout of their workers. In other words closing all the doors and saying
[00:08:34 -> 00:08:42]  you're not let in, we're not paying you. All of this takes place in the context of bargaining
[00:08:42 -> 00:08:48]  for a collective agreement to govern working conditions for up to four years, which is what
[00:08:48 -> 00:08:55]  they're in the middle of. The ability of workers to take this action is highly constrained only
[00:08:55 -> 00:09:00]  after a current agreement has expired, only after a strike ballot has approved the action and notice
[00:09:00 -> 00:09:04]  requirements have been met and always with the possibility that the action might otherwise be
[00:09:04 -> 00:09:09]  brought to an end through suspension or termination as happened. So note that what she's saying is here
[00:09:10 -> 00:09:16]  you can't just call a strike the night before, that's not how it works, it's highly constrained.
[00:09:17 -> 00:09:23]  Significantly the union in this matter had learned well the lessons of 2018 when they were cancelled.
[00:09:23 -> 00:09:29]  The action proposed was carefully calibrated to avoid the kind of threat to welfare, health, safety
[00:09:29 -> 00:09:34]  or life that would require the commission to make an order suspending it. The inability of management
[00:09:34 -> 00:09:39]  clearly to articulate this threat and to seek an order on Sunday suspending the action on this
[00:09:39 -> 00:09:46]  basis speaks volumes about the credibility of the claim itself and casts a serious cloud
[00:09:46 -> 00:09:50]  over the necessity of the management's decision to shut down the network.
[00:09:51 -> 00:09:56]  But now the management's withdrawn its work commission claim, what happens next? So note that
[00:09:56 -> 00:10:01]  they had to claim in for the work in the commission, fair work commission and they
[00:10:01 -> 00:10:07]  have withdrawn it since. The union's right to take protected industrial action is not suspended
[00:10:07 -> 00:10:13]  and it insists the proposed action is safe. If it's genuinely not safe as claimed management
[00:10:13 -> 00:10:17]  seek a suspension order under section 424 sending the parties back to the bargaining table.
[00:10:17 -> 00:10:21]  Otherwise the union action will continue in accordance with the scheme of the act
[00:10:21 -> 00:10:26]  and if management choose to shut down the network again it should own the decision for what it
[00:10:26 -> 00:10:32]  genuinely is, and this is Shea's opinion, a lockout in support of its bargaining claims,
[00:10:32 -> 00:10:40]  not an employee strike. To say otherwise is political spin. Okay so we've got this issue here
[00:10:42 -> 00:10:48]  and Shea McChrystal knows all about the labour laws and how they work and it's very very clear here
[00:10:49 -> 00:10:54]  that what has happened is actually a lockout not a strike. Why? Because the strike could not have
[00:10:54 -> 00:11:02]  occurred due to the highly constrained kind of laws around that and at the same time
[00:11:02 -> 00:11:07]  if it was as dangerous as claimed why didn't they put in the same action that they did four
[00:11:07 -> 00:11:12]  years earlier and successfully stopped the industrial action. So that's kind of what we're
[00:11:12 -> 00:11:19]  looking at here. Then we have a secondary issue which I'm not going to read out but basically
[00:11:20 -> 00:11:24]  the premier was furious that he didn't know until the morning and what has ended up happening was
[00:11:24 -> 00:11:30]  we've got an internal dossier collected of all the things that staff knew and this is basically
[00:11:30 -> 00:11:35]  this question of who knew what when. Transport Minister David Elliott, unbelievably, came under
[00:11:35 -> 00:11:43]  fire because he received a text message at 10.53 I believe it was on Sunday saying that if there
[00:11:43 -> 00:11:50]  was disruption there'd be huge disruption. This is on top of news which has since come out that
[00:11:51 -> 00:11:55]  studies were done to find out how much it would cost and how much disruption there would be
[00:11:55 -> 00:12:07]  in the weeks before this. Then David Elliott went to bed with an inkling there was going to be
[00:12:07 -> 00:12:12]  potential widespread disruption. Went to bed before any decision was made and only learned
[00:12:12 -> 00:12:17]  the network had shut down when he woke up on Monday morning. Remember he is the minister in charge
[00:12:18 -> 00:12:21]  so the decision has been made without him. The decision has been made by the head of
[00:12:23 -> 00:12:29]  City Trains. He said yeah yeah I'll back this guy to make his decision but he was literally in bed
[00:12:29 -> 00:12:34]  and didn't know until he woke up the next morning. So it's this question of competency
[00:12:36 -> 00:12:43]  and this question of who knew what when and why is that important because if these guys are in
[00:12:44 -> 00:12:49]  charge of the network and if it's actually a shut down and it's their responsibility
[00:12:50 -> 00:12:56]  then there's gross incompetence in the running of the network and Australian citizens most
[00:12:56 -> 00:13:03]  certainly Sydney siders should be absolutely ropable. Absolutely ropable that this has occurred
[00:13:05 -> 00:13:11]  and so what you can do and I've done this with my class here this is him getting grilled on them
[00:13:14 -> 00:13:19]  basically said to my class have a read through some of these articles then I want you to write
[00:13:19 -> 00:13:26]  out an evaluative paragraph. I want you to pick one of these as a criteria and evaluate the
[00:13:26 -> 00:13:31]  effectiveness of the legal system in responding to this issue of an industrial dispute between the
[00:13:31 -> 00:13:39]  employers the RTBU and Sydney Trains and I created and I've shown this before I created a scaffold
[00:13:39 -> 00:13:45]  where they basically say this is the issue this is the the problem that we've got and
[00:13:46 -> 00:13:54]  and this is the criteria that we're using so some of them used responsiveness based on Dave Elliott
[00:13:54 -> 00:13:59]  not responding well enough and to Sydney Trains not doing it others use meeting society's needs.
[00:14:00 -> 00:14:06]  So this concept of if we're going to have huge disruption of a transport system that hundreds
[00:14:06 -> 00:14:10]  of thousands of Australians use to get to work well then they need to have enough time to make
[00:14:10 -> 00:14:23]  as was claimed make where are we alternative modes of transport and extra travel time so
[00:14:23 -> 00:14:27]  and then they wrote those out sent them to me I had a look made some suggestions gave them some
[00:14:27 -> 00:14:34]  feedback etc. So here's an example where students can in real time read an article and then have a
[00:14:34 -> 00:14:43]  go at putting law into practice and thinking through who's at fault here how should it have
[00:14:43 -> 00:14:49]  happened how do we evaluate the effectiveness and the ineffectiveness of responses to this
[00:14:49 -> 00:14:54]  and then we can go into much greater detail if they so desire thinking through this process
[00:14:54 -> 00:14:58]  the Fair Work Act and industrial action etc. All right so hopefully that's a helpful
[00:14:59 -> 00:15:06]  a little example of what you can do in legal studies using information that comes out in real
[00:15:06 -> 00:15:14]  time as kids are experiencing this they're seeing that legal studies is a subject that deals in
[00:15:14 -> 00:15:20]  real time and deals with issues that are happening as we speak one of its greatest things going for
[00:15:20 -> 00:15:26]  and something that engages students greatly.
