[00:00:00 -> 00:00:10]  All right, in this video, we're going to be providing just a kind of brief walkthrough
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:15]  of this concept of business ethics and talk briefly through some of the different things
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:19]  that influence business ethics within an organization.
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:22]  So to start us off, what is business ethics?
[00:00:22 -> 00:00:26]  The best way that I can describe business ethics is it simply represents the what we
[00:00:26 -> 00:00:31]  would call principles and standards that determine acceptable conduct in business.
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:36]  And these principles and standards are really important because in a business setting, we
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:40]  need to be able to understand what are the essential rules of the game, so to speak,
[00:00:40 -> 00:00:44]  and what is going to be acceptable versus unacceptable behavior.
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:48]  Now when we think about business ethics, a lot of times we think about our own individual
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:49]  ethics, right?
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:53]  We think about our own individual beliefs about what is right and what is wrong.
[00:00:53 -> 00:01:00]  In this, while there is some degree of consistency between person to person, right, we have established
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:07]  laws around things that we view as a society that is something that is particularly unethical,
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:13]  there can be varying degrees of what is considered to be okay from person to person.
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:18]  Now the challenge is within a business context is you have a significant motivation for making
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:24]  sure that your employees act in an ethical manner because there are huge downsides associated
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:27]  with engaging in unethical behavior.
[00:01:27 -> 00:01:33]  And we've seen huge examples of this, for example, Wells Fargo opening fake accounts
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:37]  or incentivizing folks to open fake accounts for a variety of different reasons, but as
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:42]  a way to kind of attain certain monetary type bonuses.
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:48]  So when we're thinking about what impacts business ethics, we usually think about three
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:54]  things, three specific factors that are going to have an influence on business ethics.
[00:01:54 -> 00:01:58]  Now what I do want to emphasize is individually, each one of these isn't going to entirely
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:04]  sway a particular decision and affect the extent to which people engage in good ethical
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:09]  behavior, but these are the three factors that are going to have an impact on the decisions
[00:02:09 -> 00:02:11]  that we make within an organization.
[00:02:11 -> 00:02:15]  Now the first one and one that we've kind of already explored to an extent is going
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:22]  to be the individual standards and values or individuals, standards and values.
[00:02:22 -> 00:02:28]  And we as individuals, we bring with us our own past history in a variety of different
[00:02:28 -> 00:02:33]  things that shape the extent to which we think certain things are acceptable or unacceptable.
[00:02:33 -> 00:02:39]  And that can be everything from our upbringing in the kind of family context in which we
