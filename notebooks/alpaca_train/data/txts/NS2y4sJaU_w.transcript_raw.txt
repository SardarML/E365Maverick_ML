more people so like I said we're gonna talk about the  real reason that most people don't really know why they're getting denied  for a business loan maybe some of you guys notice maybe some of you guys don't  I'm assuming you don't so let's go ahead and take a look right here so as you can  see here this is a list or I'm sorry this is a graph showing you credit  sources most small businesses apply to for credit right as you can see most  small businesses are applying for credit at large banks second is small banks and  then we have non bank lender percentage so this is different places that you can  go that might have different options for funding this could be fintechs this could  be you know different options that are not banks also you can see here a very  small percentage of people go to credit unions and some go to CDF I CDF eyes are  community development finance or financial institutions they usually have  funding or funds set aside allocated to give to people that might be in  underserved communities as far as you know Bennett business funding goes so  that's what CDF eyes most people don't even know about them or they don't  search for them actively so of course they're gonna have a smaller number but  you can see here where most businesses are going to try to seek out funding for  their businesses and the reason why I'm pointing this out first is because this  is actually the biggest problem and as we can see right here sources of  business credit by approval rate so this is gonna show us where businesses are  actually gonna have a higher chance of getting approved we can see that the  number one place is non bank lenders so the third largest order out of the most  common places to go this is the lowest you know these aren't as common most  people don't go there but this is the place that most business owners are not  going but they also have the highest chance of approval with them on getting  some type of funding as you can see here the second lowest percentage of  approvals come from large banks but that's where everybody is going when  they're trying to get funding so the biggest mistake is people are going to  the wrong place to try to get funding because they do not have the best chance  of seeing approvals by going to the large banks and you know third to that  is the small banks and in actually CDF eyes which only 5% of people go to they  have a 70% approval rate so you can see that most people start off wrong because  they're not going to the right place to actually get the funds and that's  something that you can switch up simply by going to the right place and then you  can actually get a higher chance of approval and you see a 82% approval rate  versus 58% so that's a little bit more than half of people that are getting  approved at large banks the place where most people go now we're gonna look at  something else here because it's gonna be important to understand as well why  you're trying to go about trying to get funding for your business so these are  the reasons for denial of business based off percentage so we can see here that  the number one reason people get denied for business credit is going to be a low  credit score this shouldn't be a surprise to you guys but a low credit  score is 36% all of these are pretty much close but the largest percentage is  going to be a low credit score so that's gonna play a big part your personal  credit especially in the beginning phases when you're trying to get certain  types of credit and then even once you move on to getting bigger types of  credit once you've been more experienced in your business you can actually it  it's affecting a lot of people in getting funding you can see there's a  tie for second place and that is dealing with having too much debt already and I  can say that some of this debt can be from some credit accounts that might  report to your personal credit it could be from you know just having a lot of  bad debts on your credit report it can be a few different things but the second  option that's also tied for number two is insufficient collateral so people  that don't have anything asset wise that they can use as collateral to try  to get funding for the business these are the three biggest and the sec well  the third biggest thing is going to be insufficient credit history so again  there goes that credit playing a factor in you not being able to actually get  what you need and even your debt to income ratio that's something that is  tied to your credit as well so it all pretty much deals with your credit on the  major part of why people are getting denied because these are just different  aspects of your credit from your score to not having a long history or a good  history and basically just having too much debt out there so all these things  mostly your credit is going to be affecting you you can see there's 5% of  the things and also 23% is weak business performance so you don't have a lot of  revenue coming in for your business which means that the stronger you can  get your business to perform a lot of people want to try to get funding before  they even get their business performing and you need business performance  revenue coming in to be able to pay the loan back or the line of credit back so  this is something that you should also be paying attention to because a lot of  businesses do look I'm sorry a lot of funders or lenders do look at your  revenue that you're already bringing in from your business so these are  important things to look at when you try to get funding for your business so keep  all of that in mind now just so that you know the best sources of funding to  try to get for your small business is also going to be important you can see  here that a line of credit is 41% here that's gonna be one of the best ones and  then 30% as far as business loans you know going to the SBA not as you know  high percentage wise and equipment loans personal loans mortgages stuff like that  isn't as popular as far as what people are actually getting for business  funding so lines of credit are gonna be a good place to start and second from  that would be business loans now I told you guys that I would give you guys some  options on finding the best business loans and being able to compare those  business loans and I'm gonna have a link to that place in the description and  that place is actually super money so we're gonna be looking here at how they  have this comparison of business loans and how you can actually search based  off of where you believe you are so you can see here and again the link to this  is in the description you can actually look at these different places right  that are offering funding and you can see in comparison the loan amounts that  they offer you can see here a finance factory anywhere from 25,000 to 350,000  business loans that count five thousand and three million national funding five  oh yeah five hundred thousand dollars it looks like maybe the minimum that they  do smartbiz.com 30k to 5 million and you can see the interest rates that they  have 0 to 7 percent 5 to 26 percent 6 to 9.7 percent so if you want that to be a  factor that you want to pay attention to which you should then you can look here  and see what that is and compare them amongst the different places as well as  how long you can take out the loan for the long term and you can see if there's  no prepayment fees no origination fees which there are a lot of loans that have  origination fees but you're going to see all that you need to make a good  decision and even when you click on these companies you're able to get more  details about how they kind of operate financially and you can visit the sites  as well but this is a good tool for comparison now you can also see here  depending on where your credit score is you can actually move the slider here  let's say we have like a 603 right so now it eliminated a few of the options  that were there and we can see we got a blue vine here we can see what they  offer we got square here some of the same options are still present but we  changed that based off of our credit score to narrow it down to something  that will actually work for us so we can really see what our options are also if  you're a military veteran non-veteran you can put that there as well you can  put what your business revenue is you know let's say we make in about a  hundred seventy thousand a year that also narrowed down to a few different  options and now we see some other options popping up here as it starts to  narrow down based off of our actual situation how many years in business do  we have let's say we have one year in business okay that also changes things  as well so we can make sure that we are tailoring what we're looking at to our  situation so we don't have to look through all these different places we  can come right here to super money and you can do this comparison and see  what's gonna fit for you and you can get more information about the company after  you do that and you know like I'm gonna click on this one right here you can see  is

super money site and they actually do a lot of other comparisons for other types  of loan and financing options that are out there so you know super money has a  lot to offer but if you're trying to
