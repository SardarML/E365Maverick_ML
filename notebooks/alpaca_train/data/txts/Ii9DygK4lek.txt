[00:00:00 -> 00:00:13]  Howdy doody, my name is Suzy and today I'm going to share with you how to make some coffee
[00:00:13 -> 00:00:18]  filter long stem roses and rose buds.
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:24]  And this video is really a sequel to my other video where I made coffee filter roses and
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:25]  hydrangeas.
[00:00:26 -> 00:00:32]  There was such a great response and so many people that really enjoyed it that you inspired
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:42]  me to make this video and just add on these long stem roses and the little rose buds.
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:49]  So there you go, you inspire me, I inspire you, it's a beautiful relationship.
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:57]  So today, basically for starting, you're going to need some coffee filters, you're going
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:05]  to need some food colouring, some water, some paper towel, you will need some floral wire
[00:01:05 -> 00:01:12]  and you can get this at the dollar store, and some floral tape, which is a wax coated
[00:01:12 -> 00:01:17]  green tape for your stems, that too you can find at the dollar store.
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:25]  A little paint brush, a couple of long skewers or toothpicks for stirring, some very thin
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:30]  gauged wire, again I bought this at the dollar store and this is what we're going to use
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:33]  to make the leaves.
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:38]  Some really nice cutting scissors and a pen.
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:45]  And for additional tools which make things very handy is wire snippers and some needle
[00:01:45 -> 00:01:51]  nose pliers and this is, it's not essential but it makes life a lot easier.
[00:01:51 -> 00:01:59]  Now in the first video I made these roses which I have here and they look beautiful
[00:01:59 -> 00:02:07]  but really I wanted just to add a little bit more interest to my bouquet so I started off
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:16]  making these long stem roses because really I just wanted to add a variety of sizes of
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:26]  roses just to make the bouquet more interesting and that was really the beginning of doing
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:30]  these long stem roses and rose buds.
[00:02:30 -> 00:02:32]  So I'm just going to show you.
[00:02:32 -> 00:02:41]  So just by adding those additional long stem roses to the bouquet, it creates variation
[00:02:41 -> 00:02:46]  and I think it makes them even more beautiful and the other thing that you can use besides
[00:02:46 -> 00:02:55]  just having them as long stem roses like I've got here, and that looks fantastic, is that
[00:02:55 -> 00:03:02]  I've used a mixture of the long stem roses and the large roses in a very short bouquet
[00:03:02 -> 00:03:11]  and this is just dry floral foam that I've got in a little jar and created a short bouquet
[00:03:11 -> 00:03:16]  which is beautiful for the center of your table because it's short and you can see people
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:18]  on the other side.
[00:03:18 -> 00:03:21]  So the first thing that we are going to do, or the first thing that I'm going to show
[00:03:21 -> 00:03:28]  you which may be a repeat for some people but in any event it's a good refresher, is
[00:03:28 -> 00:03:34]  you're going to dye your coffee filters and you're dyeing it basically in water and food
[00:03:34 -> 00:03:35]  colouring.
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:45]  So we're going to try and you want to dye about 4 sheets at a time and the reason that
[00:03:45 -> 00:03:51]  you want to dye about 4 or 5 sheets at a time is you want to make sure that the colour goes
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:57]  all the way through but when you go to dry them, which we are going to dry these on a
[00:03:57 -> 00:04:05]  cookie sheet at 225 degrees for 15 minutes, they will dry perfectly that way.
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:10]  If you pile layer too many it will take longer to dry, that's all, but it's not the end of
[00:04:10 -> 00:04:11]  the world.
[00:04:11 -> 00:04:20]  So something that I've noticed which makes the flowers even more realistic is having
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:24]  a darker tone in the centre of the rose.
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:33]  So in this example I used a darker colour of the same pink for the centre and then lighter
[00:04:33 -> 00:04:34]  colours.
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:42]  And the way to set your colours for your roses, we want to add some water, we want tons, because
[00:04:42 -> 00:04:46]  it dilutes the colour and then you have to use a lot of food colouring.
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:52]  So let's say for instance I want to make a berry, I want to make an old fashioned pink
[00:04:53 -> 00:05:03]  so I'm just going to put a drop of the yellow and a drop of red.
[00:05:03 -> 00:05:12]  And actually I'm going to just take my drop just by using my skewer, the red is powerful
[00:05:12 -> 00:05:17]  and it will change the colour quite quickly.
[00:05:17 -> 00:05:23]  Okay so that looks a little bit too yellow and I want it a little bit pinker, so I'll
[00:05:23 -> 00:05:37]  just put just a touch, a tip, okay so that seems to have darkened it a bit and really
[00:05:37 -> 00:05:43]  the variation is going to come, I mean you can make this darker but if you're going to
[00:05:43 -> 00:05:51]  do whatever you want to do, oh gloves is a good idea, I think everybody has gloves
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:57]  these days, gloves are a good idea because the food colouring will stay with you for
[00:05:57 -> 00:05:58]  a couple of days.
[00:05:58 -> 00:06:09]  So basically you just want to just immerse your sheets in water and then I've got this
[00:06:09 -> 00:06:14]  very pale, it's almost like an old fashioned pink.
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:20]  Just going to put it on my cookie sheet and of course if you want to change the colour
[00:06:20 -> 00:06:29]  you can just add a little bit more, a little bit less, I'm going to put the full drop of
[00:06:29 -> 00:06:33]  red to see what that imparts.
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:46]  That's very very bright, this is the time that you want to play, what is this, oh that's
[00:06:46 -> 00:06:58]  very dark, I am curious to see what that looks like though, very nice.
[00:06:58 -> 00:07:05]  So I added a little bit of brown and you see how it's deepened the colour.
[00:07:05 -> 00:07:12]  So basically you're going to have to play with your colours because I certainly can't
[00:07:12 -> 00:07:18]  show you every single colour but essentially this is what I wanted to get, a darker and
[00:07:18 -> 00:07:20]  a lighter.
[00:07:20 -> 00:07:29]  Now if I like this colour for instance but I thought uh oh it's too dark then all I do
[00:07:29 -> 00:07:34]  is just add a little bit of water to dilute it.
[00:07:34 -> 00:07:43]  So I can add a little bit of water and try it out with one coffee filter at a time, let's
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:52]  see if that's lighter than the last one, I suspect it will be.
[00:07:52 -> 00:07:57]  So I like this colour and you can see the variation.
[00:07:57 -> 00:08:09]  So I'm going to take my coffee filters, for one long stem rose you're going to want one
[00:08:09 -> 00:08:16]  filter that is dark in colour, so your darker centre, and then you're going to want two
[00:08:16 -> 00:08:20]  filters for the petals on the outside.
[00:08:20 -> 00:08:27]  So it only takes 2-3 petals for each rose but if you're making a bunch of roses then
[00:08:27 -> 00:08:34]  yeah you want to just make a whole bunch of coffee filters, you can always use them in
[00:08:34 -> 00:08:38]  another project at any time.
[00:08:38 -> 00:08:41]  So I'm just going to make a few more.
[00:08:41 -> 00:08:56]  Now one thing that was really interesting was that I got this rose which goes from darker
[00:08:56 -> 00:09:02]  to lighter, so the tips of the petals are darker then it becomes a two toned rose if
[00:09:02 -> 00:09:03]  you can see that.
[00:09:03 -> 00:09:11]  I've done one in the pink, I've done one in the yellow, so these are two tones, and
[00:09:11 -> 00:09:17]  in order to get those tones you're going to dye your coffee filters, you're going to get
[00:09:17 -> 00:09:24]  your coffee filters, 4 coffee filters or 2 coffee filters, whatever, and these are the
[00:09:24 -> 00:09:30]  coffee filters that you've previously dyed and they're dried.
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:40]  And then just fold it onto itself and create a little funnel like this, and then you're
[00:09:40 -> 00:09:50]  going to dip this into a concentrated colour, in this case I did the yellow, with the pink
[00:09:50 -> 00:09:57]  I did a darker red, but I'll show you.
[00:09:57 -> 00:10:01]  You see how it's absorbing the colour?
[00:10:01 -> 00:10:08]  So then when you open it up, you're going to get the colour in the middle, now this
[00:10:08 -> 00:10:17]  isn't concentrated enough, and if it's not concentrated enough for you, so this is like
[00:10:17 -> 00:10:25]  a drop of the yellow, and I'm just going to add a little bit of water to it, and then
[00:10:25 -> 00:10:34]  you just want to just very loosely add some colour to the centre.
[00:10:34 -> 00:10:39]  And dry this again, as it dries it spreads and you get this.
[00:10:39 -> 00:10:44]  And the reason that you want that is because when we cut the petals, all the tips of the
[00:10:44 -> 00:10:53]  petals, as in this case, will have the darker colour and then fade into the lighter colour
[00:10:53 -> 00:10:57]  of the coffee filter that you originally dyed.
[00:10:57 -> 00:11:04]  So those are the two tips on dyeing, use whatever colours you like, make extra filters in case
[00:11:04 -> 00:11:10]  your rose doesn't turn out the first time around, so you've got extras.
[00:11:10 -> 00:11:16]  Now when it comes to your leaves, which I've got some here and they're dried, you're going
[00:11:16 -> 00:11:23]  to have your patterns cut out, but you're going to cut them out of some coffee filters
[00:11:23 -> 00:11:27]  that you've previously dyed in a green.
[00:11:27 -> 00:11:30]  The green turns out to be very very light.
[00:11:30 -> 00:11:34]  So what you're going to do is you're going to take these filters, you're going to cut
[00:11:34 -> 00:11:41]  out your pattern, just like I have here, and then you are going to make a small concentrated
[00:11:41 -> 00:11:50]  amount of the green that you like, and yellow, a little bit of yellow, a little bit of red,
[00:11:50 -> 00:11:57]  a little bit of green, gives you a very nice olive colour, which are the colour of these
[00:11:57 -> 00:11:58]  leaves.
[00:11:58 -> 00:12:03]  And if you don't add the red, then you can get a very bright green colour like this.
[00:12:03 -> 00:12:13]  So it's really green here, but I've got yellow and blue, which is going to make green, and
[00:12:13 -> 00:12:20]  you can see, look at that, it's a very very dark green, but I want it a little bit, I
[00:12:20 -> 00:12:24]  want it actually a little bit more yellowish, it's too bluish.
[00:12:24 -> 00:12:31]  So I'm going to just add a touch of orange, yes, that's a beautiful colour.
[00:12:31 -> 00:12:38]  So this is very concentrated, and you're just going to want to add like half a teaspoon
[00:12:38 -> 00:12:45]  of water at a time, oop, I think that was a teaspoon, okay, so a teaspoon, or half a
[00:12:45 -> 00:12:50]  teaspoon of water at a time until you get a colour that you like, but you want to make
[00:12:50 -> 00:12:56]  sure you don't add too much water because you're painting this directly onto the leaves.
[00:12:56 -> 00:13:07]  So I've got my leaves here, and I've previously dyed the coffee filters, and you want to do
[00:13:07 -> 00:13:16]  two leaves at a time, because if you do more than two leaves, and you want to do both sides,
[00:13:16 -> 00:13:23]  if you do more than two leaves at a time, the paint will not go all the way through.
[00:13:23 -> 00:13:26]  So you're just going to take your leaves and you're going to go through and you're
[00:13:26 -> 00:13:36]  going to paint this concentrated green on both sides of the leaves to make sure it's
[00:13:36 -> 00:13:44]  saturated all the way through, and then you're going to put this in the oven at 225 degrees.
[00:13:44 -> 00:13:50]  Now if you're doing all leaves, you've only got two little layers of leaves, so you want
[00:13:50 -> 00:13:54]  to maybe check it after five minutes, because there isn't much paper there to dry.
[00:13:54 -> 00:14:01]  Just keep an eye on it between 5-10 minutes at 225, and then you'll get your dry leaves,
[00:14:01 -> 00:14:06]  which I will show you how to assemble in the next step.
[00:14:06 -> 00:14:13]  So here we are, we're just getting ready to start, and we are going to start off by making
[00:14:13 -> 00:14:18]  the rosebud, and we're going to make two sizes of the rosebud, and the reason I'm making
[00:14:18 -> 00:14:30]  two sizes is the larger rosebuds that I was making are more in scale with the roses that
[00:14:30 -> 00:14:33]  I made from the first video.
[00:14:33 -> 00:14:41]  The smaller rosebuds, which are these ones, they're slightly smaller, they're going to
[00:14:41 -> 00:14:46]  be in a separate vase for just the long stem roses.
[00:14:46 -> 00:14:50]  So it's the exact same process, but I'm just going to show you how to make one slightly
[00:14:50 -> 00:14:55]  bigger than the other, so that you have the option to do either or.
[00:14:55 -> 00:15:00]  So now we've got all our equipment, everything ready to go.
[00:15:00 -> 00:15:11]  We're going to start off with two coffee filters, and this is the rosebud, so you can certainly
[00:15:11 -> 00:15:24]  do it any color that you like, but I'm going to use two filters that are of the same color,
[00:15:24 -> 00:15:38]  and all I'm going to do is I'm going to fold them in half, and then one of them I'm going
[00:15:38 -> 00:15:50]  to fold over just a little pleat like this, about a quarter of an inch, and the second
[00:15:50 -> 00:15:57]  one I'm going to do the same thing, but I'm going to fold it over a quarter of an inch,
[00:15:57 -> 00:16:02]  and I'm going to fold it over twice.
[00:16:02 -> 00:16:12]  So I've folded that over twice, you can see the two folds, and we're going to set these
[00:16:12 -> 00:16:14]  off to the side.
[00:16:14 -> 00:16:19]  Now to start our rosebud, if we're going to make the small rosebud, we're basically going
[00:16:19 -> 00:16:24]  to take some paper towel and scrunch it up into a little ball, and we're going to put
[00:16:24 -> 00:16:26]  it on our stem.
[00:16:26 -> 00:16:32]  So this is the little ball that I started off with for the small rose, and this one
[00:16:32 -> 00:16:34]  is a larger one.
[00:16:34 -> 00:16:42]  So basically the center I'm making one smaller than the other, if you can see the difference
[00:16:42 -> 00:16:47]  in size.
[00:16:47 -> 00:16:55]  So to make this little ball we're going to need one piece of paper towel and our floral
[00:16:55 -> 00:17:05]  wire, and then we're going to take our needle nose, and we're going to turn it at the end
[00:17:05 -> 00:17:10]  and just make a little loop like this.
[00:17:10 -> 00:17:17]  And this little loop is just going to help adhere to the little ball that we're going
[00:17:17 -> 00:17:18]  to make.
[00:17:18 -> 00:17:25]  So we're going to use one whole paper towel, and we're just going to fold it into itself
[00:17:25 -> 00:17:27]  to create our center.
[00:17:27 -> 00:17:40]  And we want it to be slightly egg-shaped, so the shape of a rosebud.
[00:17:40 -> 00:17:46]  So I've basically just squeezed it like this, and then I'm just going to open it up and
[00:17:46 -> 00:17:55]  add some glue in here, in here, in here, and then along the center.
[00:17:55 -> 00:18:04]  And I'm going to put my hook in there, and then I'm just going to twist it and glue it
[00:18:04 -> 00:18:09]  in place.
[00:18:09 -> 00:18:10]  There you go.
[00:18:10 -> 00:18:11]  And that's it.
[00:18:11 -> 00:18:17]  So that's the center of our rosebud that we're starting.
[00:18:17 -> 00:18:25]  Now we're going to take our first piece that we folded over twice, so it's got these two
[00:18:25 -> 00:18:32]  little folds, and then we're going to take it and we're going to just cut off about,
[00:18:32 -> 00:18:34]  I guess, a quarter of it.
[00:18:34 -> 00:18:38]  So we're just going to cut the end off, and we're going to end up with two pieces like
[00:18:38 -> 00:18:39]  this.
[00:18:39 -> 00:18:46]  And then we're just going to take the small piece, and we're going to use it to wrap the
[00:18:46 -> 00:18:52]  butt so it's the same color as the petals are going to be.
[00:18:52 -> 00:18:59]  And I usually just take the paper and form it without the glue, just so you've got a
[00:18:59 -> 00:19:02]  bit of a shape to start off with.
[00:19:02 -> 00:19:12]  And then just open it up and glue it to our bud, so that's not too difficult.
[00:19:12 -> 00:19:23]  So we're just gluing it down and squishing it, and then we always want to squish it on
[00:19:23 -> 00:19:27]  the bottom so that you're getting a bud going like this.
[00:19:27 -> 00:19:31]  No big deal, just something simple like that.
[00:19:31 -> 00:19:40]  Now with this other piece that we have left over, we're going to create a little funnel.
[00:19:40 -> 00:19:49]  So we want to create a little funnel that you can just insert your finger and create
[00:19:49 -> 00:19:54]  this little funnel like this.
[00:19:54 -> 00:20:00]  And we're going to fit our bud into the little funnel.
[00:20:00 -> 00:20:07]  And you want it to be about that tight and this big.
[00:20:07 -> 00:20:17]  So now that we've got it, what I'm going to do, I'm going to just glue the side so as
[00:20:17 -> 00:20:20]  not to lose the little curl.
[00:20:20 -> 00:20:29]  And then as it's open on the bottom this way, I'm just going to go in with dabs of glue
[00:20:29 -> 00:20:36]  and just squish it together and turn it in the same direction.
[00:20:36 -> 00:20:39]  See how the seam is going this way?
[00:20:39 -> 00:20:45]  Just turn it in the same direction and then you get that swirl effect.
[00:20:45 -> 00:20:53]  You could leave it like this as a little tiny bud, but I think it's nice that we're going
[00:20:53 -> 00:20:54]  to create a funnel.
[00:20:54 -> 00:21:02]  With this funnel, we're going to take our piece of paper and there's our fold, and we're
[00:21:02 -> 00:21:06]  just going to put it in the opposite direction and fold it in the opposite direction.
[00:21:06 -> 00:21:17]  Just exposing some of that tip and you see it creates another little layer to our bud.
[00:21:17 -> 00:21:26]  And then I just turn it, creating this shape, and then I open it up and that's when I add
[00:21:26 -> 00:21:34]  the glue on the inside, inside the little flower, and you just pop your glue in, turn
[00:21:34 -> 00:21:43]  it until it's glued.
[00:21:43 -> 00:21:46]  So now you've got your little rosebud.
[00:21:46 -> 00:21:48]  You see the shape?
[00:21:48 -> 00:22:05]  Now from here, we're going to add our little outside stem leaves, like we've got here.
[00:22:05 -> 00:22:12]  So they're like this, and we're going to add the stem leaves so that it's going to cover
[00:22:12 -> 00:22:17]  a little bit of the stem, but not all the way around because we're going to add two
[00:22:17 -> 00:22:20]  more to create five, so this is three.
[00:22:20 -> 00:22:30]  So it's like this, and then you just want to add glue here, glue here, and just tack
[00:22:30 -> 00:22:40]  it into place, leaving a space for the other two petals that we're going to add, or one
[00:22:40 -> 00:22:45]  petal that I like, five, it's an odd number.
[00:22:45 -> 00:22:54]  So I just took that, and you slice off two, and then we're just going to add these two
[00:22:54 -> 00:23:04]  to the stem at the bottom, like so, there we go.
[00:23:10 -> 00:23:21]  Glue, and we're going to come in and we're going to pinch it into place so that all the
[00:23:21 -> 00:23:28]  leaves are covering the little bud, like so.
[00:23:28 -> 00:23:34]  And to the leaves, you just want to give them, fold them, and it just makes it look a little
[00:23:34 -> 00:23:36]  bit more realistic.
[00:23:36 -> 00:23:45]  Just fold the little leaves right down the middle, it gives them a little definition.
[00:23:45 -> 00:23:55]  And then the tip, you want to, and I've got a little bowl of water here, you want to keep
[00:23:55 -> 00:24:03]  your fingers moist, and you're just going to give it a little twist and create this
[00:24:03 -> 00:24:11]  little tip that is pointy.
[00:24:11 -> 00:24:16]  And it holds, it kind of holds the shape of the little petals, but it also makes it look
[00:24:16 -> 00:24:21]  a little bit more realistic, as in life.
[00:24:21 -> 00:24:29]  And then at this point, what I do is I take a look at the bud, and I'm going to tack my
[00:24:29 -> 00:24:39]  little petals all the way around the way that I would like them, and I just tack them
[00:24:39 -> 00:24:49]  just halfway through on the rows, one little dot, that's all it takes, one little dot,
[00:24:49 -> 00:25:00]  and then that way I can kind of position them in a way that I want to see the petals covered.
[00:25:00 -> 00:25:10]  This little guy is a little too far over, as you can see, but that's okay.
[00:25:10 -> 00:25:20]  We'll just tack it down over a little, and there we go.
[00:25:20 -> 00:25:25]  So these are all tacked down.
[00:25:25 -> 00:25:34]  You can curl them out a little bit, or leave them closed, however you like.
[00:25:34 -> 00:25:43]  And then at this point, we're just going to take our tape, and this is floral tape,
[00:25:43 -> 00:25:48]  which is waxy.
[00:25:48 -> 00:25:54]  It's waxy and it has a little stretch.
[00:25:54 -> 00:26:02]  And we're just going to start at the very top of the bottom of the flower, and you want
[00:26:02 -> 00:26:10]  to give it a good tug to start it, so that it's pretty tight, and then you're just going
[00:26:10 -> 00:26:16]  to, and you want to keep your stems, the straighter your stems, the easier it's going to be.
[00:26:16 -> 00:26:21]  And then you're just going to pull and turn.
[00:26:21 -> 00:26:30]  So I'm twisting and I'm pulling the tape at the same time, and the wax actually creates
[00:26:31 -> 00:26:37]  well, it's a little bit sticky and it adheres to the wire.
[00:26:37 -> 00:26:45]  Now I've got, that doesn't look so good, there's a little gap here, and I can just take a little
[00:26:45 -> 00:26:55]  extra piece, like this, and I'm going to add it to here to cover up that little gap, because
[00:26:55 -> 00:26:59]  I don't like it.
[00:26:59 -> 00:27:04]  So it's very versatile, the tape, you see?
[00:27:04 -> 00:27:13]  So now you've got this covered wire, I already know that my rosebud is too long, so I'm just
[00:27:13 -> 00:27:19]  going to just nip it off the bottom, I don't want it that long.
[00:27:19 -> 00:27:24]  So that's the bud, which I think looks really beautiful.
[00:27:24 -> 00:27:29]  Now we're not finished with the bud, because we're still going to add leaves to it.
[00:27:29 -> 00:27:32]  So I'm going to show you how to make the leaves.
[00:27:32 -> 00:27:41]  Now for the leaves, you're going to need about 6 inches of this thin gauged wire, which I
[00:27:41 -> 00:27:50]  got at the dollar store, and you're going to need two little wires.
[00:27:50 -> 00:28:05]  So one 6 inch wire, two, so you've got these two little wires, and then I'm just going
[00:28:05 -> 00:28:14]  to take a little bit of my floral tape, you know, a little piece, another little piece,
[00:28:14 -> 00:28:19]  difficult to start because the wire is so thin, but you want to just pinch it and get
[00:28:19 -> 00:28:26]  that started, and then you're just going to cover, not even the whole wire, just the
[00:28:26 -> 00:28:32]  middle of the wire, like that, you just want enough.
[00:28:32 -> 00:28:37]  This is the part that's going to be showing once the flower is done.
[00:28:37 -> 00:28:46]  So we'll do that to the two little pieces of wire, the leaves I was working on have
[00:28:46 -> 00:28:48]  come off on my hands.
[00:28:48 -> 00:29:01]  So then you've got these two little pieces of wire that have metal on the ends, and then
[00:29:01 -> 00:29:07]  you're going to take the two little pieces of wire, you're going to make a cross, and
[00:29:07 -> 00:29:11]  you're going to have a short piece, a long piece, and a long piece, and then you're going
[00:29:11 -> 00:29:22]  to take the two long pieces, twist them together two times, and then you get this pattern which
[00:29:22 -> 00:29:27]  is the way the leaves are on a rose.
[00:29:27 -> 00:29:41]  So now that we've got our little cross, we're going to take six petals, two, four, six,
[00:29:41 -> 00:29:48]  and I really like doing a light and a dark color, it looks very interesting on the leaves
[00:29:48 -> 00:29:53]  where one side is light and the other side is dark, but you do whatever you like.
[00:29:53 -> 00:30:03]  So I've got six petals, three pairs, and then I'm going to take a pair, and it doesn't
[00:30:03 -> 00:30:09]  matter, I've made so many leaves I've lost pairs so they don't match up, but that's okay
[00:30:09 -> 00:30:12]  because we can trim it afterwards.
[00:30:12 -> 00:30:19]  And then I'm just going to fold it in half, and then just do a little accordion like this,
[00:30:19 -> 00:30:26]  and it just gives it a little bit of a more natural look.
[00:30:26 -> 00:30:35]  And then you just open up your little petals, and we're going to put a bead of glue all
[00:30:35 -> 00:30:41]  the way down the middle of the petal, and then we're going to take one of our little
[00:30:41 -> 00:30:47]  sticks, we're going to put it right in the middle of the petal, and then we are going
[00:30:47 -> 00:30:57]  to sandwich our wire between the two petals so you see the petal now becomes flexible
[00:30:57 -> 00:30:58]  and movable.
[00:30:58 -> 00:31:04]  But the sides are not glued, so we're going to follow the outline and glue the two petals
[00:31:04 -> 00:31:05]  together.
[00:31:05 -> 00:31:13]  So I'll glue the center and I'll do the outline at the same time.
[00:31:13 -> 00:31:22]  So then it looks like this, and you've got the little tail on the bottom.
[00:31:22 -> 00:31:29]  So when you're drawing out these leaves, I guess I forgot to show you, you're going to
[00:31:29 -> 00:31:39]  need one coffee filter, so you've got your coffee filter like this, and you're going
[00:31:39 -> 00:31:51]  to fold it once, fold it twice, fold it three times, and you're going to draw out your leaf
[00:31:51 -> 00:31:55]  with the little tail, like that.
[00:31:55 -> 00:32:02]  And that little tail is this little tail, which we are going to twist and glue onto
[00:32:02 -> 00:32:06]  the stem, and it's going to make the leaf pucker.
[00:32:06 -> 00:32:16]  But before we do that, so our leaves don't match up.
[00:32:16 -> 00:32:28]  So all you have to do is I'm going to just come back in, and I'm going to trim the leaves
[00:32:28 -> 00:32:33]  so that they are a perfect match.
[00:32:33 -> 00:32:37]  I'm going to take a little bit of that stem.
[00:32:37 -> 00:32:41]  So now they're a perfect match.
[00:32:41 -> 00:32:47]  And then this little tail, I'm going to glue together right there, and then I'm going to
[00:32:47 -> 00:32:51]  add a little bit on the top.
[00:32:51 -> 00:32:59]  I'm going to pucker the leaf, and then I'm just going to twist the little stem.
[00:32:59 -> 00:33:04]  Oops, it needs a little bit more.
[00:33:04 -> 00:33:11]  I'm always, you're always better off using less glue than too much glue because it gets
[00:33:11 -> 00:33:15]  very hot, and it will burn your hands.
[00:33:15 -> 00:33:23]  So you see, when you twist it, you get a little pucker, and now you can twist that leaf however
[00:33:23 -> 00:33:24]  you want.
[00:33:24 -> 00:33:26]  So now let's do the other two.
[00:33:26 -> 00:33:29]  We're going to do the same thing.
[00:33:29 -> 00:33:43]  We've got our leaves, fold, create a crease, accordion fold, just to give it a little shape,
[00:33:43 -> 00:33:58]  opening, open up your leaves, fold down one side, and then we're going to put a bead of
[00:33:58 -> 00:34:02]  glue from the top all the way down to the bottom.
[00:34:02 -> 00:34:15]  We're going to insert our wire and sandwich it between the two leaves.
[00:34:15 -> 00:34:20]  And the leaves don't match up again, but before I cut them, I'm just going to fold the leaf
[00:34:20 -> 00:34:30]  over like so, put a bead of glue on the outline, sandwich it together.
[00:34:30 -> 00:34:35]  We're going to do the same thing on the other side.
[00:34:35 -> 00:34:43]  Open up the leaf, put a little bead of glue by just following the outline, glue it together
[00:34:43 -> 00:34:45]  so it's like this.
[00:34:45 -> 00:34:53]  And now they're not matching up that great, so we're just going to come in and take your
[00:34:53 -> 00:35:06]  scissors and just trim it so that they match, and you get a perfect leaf.
[00:35:06 -> 00:35:11]  Then we've got that little tail that's left over that's loose, just going to put a bead
[00:35:11 -> 00:35:18]  of glue in between it and a little bit of glue on the top, and we're just going to pinch
[00:35:18 -> 00:35:24]  it so that you've got this little pucker, and then we're going to just turn it around
[00:35:24 -> 00:35:31]  and glue it right into the branch, so it just becomes part of the little branch.
[00:35:31 -> 00:35:43]  Then our last one, a little bit, and it's nice that you're actually cutting each leaf
[00:35:44 -> 00:35:50]  because then each leaf becomes a little bit different, which I think helps and makes it
[00:35:50 -> 00:35:52]  more interesting.
[00:35:52 -> 00:36:03]  So that's the basic shape that we want, and so now we've got our little rosebud.
[00:36:03 -> 00:36:10]  You'll probably end up with a whole bunch of these little glue hairs or whatever.
[00:36:11 -> 00:36:16]  You want to put it, well, you can put it wherever you like, but you want to keep it fairly close
[00:36:16 -> 00:36:27]  to the top because when you insert your roses into the vase, as I have here, it's a fuller
[00:36:27 -> 00:36:30]  look in your vase.
[00:36:30 -> 00:36:41]  So I think that's tall enough, and then you just add your two pieces of wire together.
[00:36:41 -> 00:36:49]  You can twist it around just so that it holds in place, like so.
[00:36:49 -> 00:36:57]  Then you want a little piece of tape, just about that much.
[00:36:58 -> 00:37:05]  If you see the curtains moving, that's my dog Chester looking outside.
[00:37:05 -> 00:37:09]  I think he's trying to tell me something.
[00:37:09 -> 00:37:23]  And then you're just going to add the tape over the two wires, and then that's it.
[00:37:23 -> 00:37:27]  There you go.
[00:37:27 -> 00:37:30]  That is your rosebud.
[00:37:30 -> 00:37:32]  That's a small rosebud.
[00:37:32 -> 00:37:39]  So we can add that to our vase, and you see how quite effective it becomes, and it's just
[00:37:39 -> 00:37:45]  like a different size of rose.
[00:37:45 -> 00:37:53]  Now for the larger rosebud, we're actually going to do the exact same thing, except that
[00:37:53 -> 00:38:02]  we're just going to use a little bit more...we're going to use three filters instead of two,
[00:38:02 -> 00:38:07]  and we're going to make our base a little bit bigger.
[00:38:07 -> 00:38:16]  So I'm going to grab the larger rosebud, we're going to need one and a half pieces
[00:38:16 -> 00:38:29]  of your paper towel, and that just takes it one size up.
[00:38:29 -> 00:38:37]  So one and a half, scrunch it up, create your ball, but also keeping in mind that you want
[00:38:37 -> 00:38:54]  to create this rosebud shape, or an oval shape to start off with, so like so, and just
[00:38:54 -> 00:38:59]  funneling it down so you've got a little tail that you can add this wire to.
[00:38:59 -> 00:39:16]  We're starting off with a slightly larger center, you can use three or two, the rosebud
[00:39:16 -> 00:39:19]  is going to be larger because you've made the center larger.
[00:39:19 -> 00:39:30]  So we're going to start off like we did before, we're going to fold our coffee filter in half,
[00:39:30 -> 00:39:42]  then create this little quarter inch fold, create another quarter inch fold, like that.
[00:39:42 -> 00:39:53]  You're going to cut off about a quarter of it, because we need this to wrap our bud in
[00:39:53 -> 00:40:02]  so that you can't see the color, and if you just wrap it like this, and then add your
[00:40:02 -> 00:40:10]  glue, I find it makes it a lot easier, just add glue to the inside, you just want to cover
[00:40:10 -> 00:40:14]  it so it's the same color, and then you're going to do the same thing, we're going to
[00:40:14 -> 00:40:28]  create a little funnel hole, like so, you see, like that, a very small hole, and you
[00:40:28 -> 00:40:39]  will also want to make sure that it is upright with the flower, so you want to make sure
[00:40:39 -> 00:40:47]  that it's up like this, so now I've got my first little wrap, there we go, so now you've
[00:40:47 -> 00:40:54]  got this, it's all nicely glued, and we're going to do the same thing that we did with
[00:40:54 -> 00:41:04]  the smaller rose, but this time we're going to still create the same funnel, and we're
[00:41:04 -> 00:41:14]  going to fold it in half, and this time we're just going to fold it back onto itself once,
[00:41:14 -> 00:41:19]  then you're going to create your little funnel just to start it off with your finger, you
[00:41:19 -> 00:41:32]  want it to be opposite, right, so that you've got this swirling effect, and make sure that
[00:41:32 -> 00:41:49]  as you're gluing, you are funneling the bottom, or you want to narrow the bottom so that it
[00:41:49 -> 00:41:57]  blends nicely into your wire, that's two, and you can leave it like that if you like
[00:41:57 -> 00:42:06]  the size, but I'll show you the difference in size right now, it's already larger because
[00:42:06 -> 00:42:12]  we've started with the larger center, and it will be more to scale of the other flowers,
[00:42:12 -> 00:42:24]  but I'm going to do a third petal, so we're going to do the same thing, fold it back once,
[00:42:24 -> 00:42:33]  and then we want to create a fold on the opposite side, so we're creating another funnel,
[00:42:33 -> 00:42:40]  this time it's a little bit wider, in the same direction as your swirl, and then hold
[00:42:40 -> 00:42:47]  it in place, and then of course open this up and start gluing, there we go, ok so this
[00:42:47 -> 00:43:00]  is our rosebud, and you can definitely see that it is larger in size than this rosebud,
[00:43:00 -> 00:43:05]  and then we're going to do the exact same thing as we did with the small rosebud, we're
[00:43:05 -> 00:43:15]  going to grab some leaves, this at the bottom, and kind of try and blend it into the stem,
[00:43:15 -> 00:43:23]  it'll make it look nicer, and finish off this part, now this doesn't seem to be lining
[00:43:23 -> 00:43:31]  up as well, so actually, you know what, I'm going to take these two, because you want
[00:43:31 -> 00:43:37]  it to make it look symmetrical, there's a little gap there, so I'm going to just glue
[00:43:37 -> 00:43:54]  one here, and I'm going to glue another petal, so I can glue these petals very close to this
[00:43:54 -> 00:44:02]  bud, so it looks like a whole bud, or I can do what I was doing before, and crimp and
[00:44:02 -> 00:44:10]  push them out so that they're slightly open, just create a little crease in the middle,
[00:44:10 -> 00:44:14]  and then we're going to dip our fingers in a little bit of water, and just twirl these
[00:44:14 -> 00:44:30]  little guys at the end, look at them, so they just have a little spike, adorable no?
[00:44:30 -> 00:44:38]  I am going to tack these on to the side, look how beautiful that is, very nice, and then
[00:44:38 -> 00:44:51]  you want to get a good grip on it to start, and sometimes, if I'm having a hard time,
[00:44:51 -> 00:45:02]  there goes the ghost again, he's getting restless, whoops, hold on, and then I'm going
[00:45:02 -> 00:45:09]  to do the same thing I did before, to get this shape, and then I'm going to take my
[00:45:09 -> 00:45:16]  two leaves and add it on, and then I'm going to come in and I'm going to add this maybe
[00:45:16 -> 00:45:26]  a little bit further down, large, and our small, so you can see the size difference
[00:45:26 -> 00:45:32]  between the two, and like I said, the only reason I'm making the larger one is because
[00:45:32 -> 00:45:39]  I think it's more in scale with the roses that I made, maybe you made, in the previous
[00:45:39 -> 00:45:48]  video, but nevertheless, it looks beautiful with large buds and small buds, so next we
[00:45:48 -> 00:45:57]  are going to make our actual rose, and it's the exact same method as I just showed you,
[00:45:57 -> 00:46:02]  it's the same method for a larger or smaller bud, and it's the same thing for the rose,
[00:46:02 -> 00:46:11]  so we're going to make a smaller rose, which is going to be this size, and we are also
[00:46:11 -> 00:46:20]  going to make a larger rose, which is going to be this size, so I don't know if you can
[00:46:20 -> 00:46:27]  tell one is larger than the other, but it is, so they're made exactly the same way,
[00:46:27 -> 00:46:32]  it's just you're going to start off with one core which is larger than the other, so we're
[00:46:32 -> 00:46:39]  going to start off making our small rose, and we're going to use our paper towel, one
[00:46:39 -> 00:46:50]  piece of paper towel, adhere to our floral wire, and from here, I'll put this away, so
[00:46:50 -> 00:46:56]  I think you'll see less activity with the curtains now that doggie has been walked,
[00:46:56 -> 00:47:06]  so getting back to our small rose, long stem rose, so we basically scrunched up one paper
[00:47:06 -> 00:47:14]  towel and turned it into this little oval shape, and then we're going to take two coffee
[00:47:14 -> 00:47:20]  filters, and I'm going to use the ones that I've got the deeper colour in the middle,
[00:47:20 -> 00:47:29]  and you'll see how that works, and we're going to fold it over once, and then we're
[00:47:29 -> 00:47:43]  going to fold it over again, and then we're going to fold it over again, we're going to
[00:47:43 -> 00:47:50]  get 16 petals all together, and then all we're going to do is we're going to separate
[00:47:50 -> 00:48:05]  all the petals by cutting down the middle straight through, so now we've got all our
[00:48:05 -> 00:48:13]  separate petals, and this is actually going to be the top of our petal, and this is going
[00:48:13 -> 00:48:24]  to be the bottom of our petal, and then I want you just to take half of the bunch, and
[00:48:24 -> 00:48:35]  we're going to create a pleat so that our petal becomes cupped, and you see how the
[00:48:35 -> 00:48:47]  little pleat is on an angle, that basically is giving us the shape for our long stem rose,
[00:48:47 -> 00:48:52]  so then we're going to take the other half, we're going to do the same thing, we're going
[00:48:52 -> 00:49:04]  to make a pleat, it's like a little V, and all the petals are cupped, so now we're just
[00:49:04 -> 00:49:15]  going to separate all the little petals, and then we're going to put a dab of glue on the
[00:49:15 -> 00:49:26]  inside and on the outside in order to glue that together, so just a dot on the inside of that
[00:49:26 -> 00:49:38]  pleat, a dot on the other side of the pleat, and we press it together, and it's this little cup.
[00:49:38 -> 00:49:53]  Do this to all the petals except for two, so two of the petals are going to go towards covering
[00:49:53 -> 00:50:10]  the center of the rose, which is the paper towel, and the other petals, which is going to leave us
[00:50:10 -> 00:50:17]  with 14 petals, we're going to use around that little bud.
[00:50:17 -> 00:50:44]  Ok, so we've got all our little cupped petals here, and now we've got these two flat triangles,
[00:50:44 -> 00:51:12]  and we're just going to add some glue to the triangle, and we're going to cover the center with one,
[00:51:12 -> 00:51:23]  and cover it with the second petal. We're going to take our petal, which is cupped, and we're going to just insert it,
[00:51:23 -> 00:51:38]  so we want the petal, or the point, to be that far above, and so we're going to hold it like this,
[00:51:39 -> 00:51:49]  we're going to add glue here, and we're going to add glue here, and we're going to fold the petal around itself,
[00:51:49 -> 00:51:59]  so we've got this, and we're going to do that with three petals, so we're going to work in three,
[00:51:59 -> 00:52:13]  so I'm going to overlap slightly, do the same thing, come in with a bit of glue, wrap it around itself,
[00:52:13 -> 00:52:29]  now we've got that, and then I'm going to take the third petal, and wrap it around there, add some glue,
[00:52:29 -> 00:52:47]  and then just glue it onto itself, like this, so we've got this, and we're going to continue going all the way around,
[00:52:47 -> 00:52:57]  and I find it easier to place my petal, so I look for the gap, in this case it's here, I place my petal on top,
[00:52:58 -> 00:53:05]  making sure the points are slightly lined up, and then I turn it over, in place, and then glue it,
[00:53:05 -> 00:53:18]  and I just find that it's easier to get it, all the petals will work more evenly, so here's my next gap,
[00:53:19 -> 00:53:32]  I know it's going to look good here, petals are all the same, I turn it around, and glue it, in place,
[00:53:32 -> 00:53:43]  and try squeezing the end so it doesn't bulk up too much, and take a look at your flower,
[00:53:43 -> 00:53:54]  and just see where there's a petal missing, that looks good there, turn it around, add your bit of glue,
[00:53:59 -> 00:54:11]  you want the shape to be consistent, and you want all the petal lengths to be equal, so just keeping that in mind.
[00:54:14 -> 00:54:19]  Then you end up with something like this.
[00:54:23 -> 00:54:32]  We're going to add our stem leaves, and this is a larger flower, so we're definitely going to need 5 of these,
[00:54:32 -> 00:54:49]  so 3, and then I cut off 2 extra, and I forgot to mention, but we're making our stem leaves,
[00:54:49 -> 00:54:57]  and we're going to get 4 stem leaves out of 1 coffee filter, which we're going to dye this green,
[00:54:57 -> 00:55:06]  and we're going to fold it once, and we're going to fold it over again, and then we're going to draw this simple design.
[00:55:10 -> 00:55:21]  Draw our outline, which is this design, and we're going to cut it out, so we're going to get 4 stem leaves per filter,
[00:55:21 -> 00:55:28]  so depending on how many flowers you're making, I just make a whole bunch, and then I can use them as I go along.
[00:55:29 -> 00:55:44]  So we're going to add for our other 2 leaves, which we're going to attach, and again it seems to, yeah, I'm going to cut them,
[00:55:44 -> 00:55:56]  and I'm going to attach them one by one, because I think I can get a better orientation on the flowers,
[00:55:56 -> 00:56:05]  and make them a little bit spaced out better around the flower, so I've got a little bit of a gap here,
[00:56:05 -> 00:56:15]  and I'm going to add my final one here, so then we've got this, and just as we did with our rosebud,
[00:56:15 -> 00:56:24]  we want to just take each one of our stem leaves, and just crease it down the middle, a little fold,
[00:56:25 -> 00:56:34]  and then the ends, dip our finger in a little bit of water, and just twirl it, a little leaf, and tuck it in place,
[00:56:36 -> 00:56:39]  halfway, so then it looks like this.
[00:56:40 -> 00:56:54]  And now, just measure out a strip around the base of the rose, and we're going to turn it,
[00:56:54 -> 00:57:05]  and we're going to turn, we're going to pull with the left, and twirl with the right, pull and twirl, pull and twirl.
[00:57:05 -> 00:57:12]  Now we have this, and now comes the magic.
[00:57:12 -> 00:57:21]  So I'm going to demonstrate on a petal.
[00:57:22 -> 00:57:25]  So all we're going to do, we're going to start from the outside.
[00:57:25 -> 00:57:30]  We've got all these loose petals, we're going to start from the outside, and we're going to,
[00:57:30 -> 00:57:37]  and pretend this is an outside petal, we're going to just make our fingers moist,
[00:57:37 -> 00:57:45]  and we're going to twirl the tip, and we're going to roll it up,
[00:57:45 -> 00:57:56]  just like you would roll up the rim on a coffee filter, or roll up the rim on a cup.
[00:57:56 -> 00:58:01]  And you can see the effect that that twirling has.
[00:58:01 -> 00:58:08]  You can twirl both sides, you can untwirl it as well.
[00:58:08 -> 00:58:15]  But see how that creates a petal that's very realistic.
[00:58:15 -> 00:58:22]  So I'm going to start off with the outside petals, it works better if your hands are damp,
[00:58:22 -> 00:58:33]  and I'm going to twirl, and the very outer petals, I'm actually going to try and twirl all the way down the side.
[00:58:33 -> 00:58:38]  So I'm going to twirl the top, and I'm going to twirl the side,
[00:58:38 -> 00:58:43]  and then I'm going to move on to the next petal,
[00:58:43 -> 00:58:49]  and I'm going to twirl that down, move on to the next petal,
[00:58:49 -> 00:58:52]  and I'm going to twirl it off to the side.
[00:58:52 -> 00:58:58]  You don't have to twirl it directly down, which you can,
[00:58:58 -> 00:59:09]  but it makes it more interesting if you roll it up, and alternate, roll up one side,
[00:59:09 -> 00:59:17]  then on the next petal, roll it up in the opposite direction.
[00:59:17 -> 00:59:22]  And keep doing that all the way around.
[00:59:22 -> 00:59:35]  And this really turns these petals into very realistic rose petals.
[00:59:35 -> 00:59:40]  You see how it's turning out?
[00:59:40 -> 00:59:44]  You do have to get those fingers damp.
[00:59:44 -> 00:59:47]  And there you go.
[00:59:47 -> 00:59:49]  There's a single rose.
[00:59:49 -> 01:00:09]  Now this rose, I didn't add the little twirl in the middle, so it creates a different effect.
[01:00:09 -> 01:00:13]  And let me show you when you add that in the middle.
[01:00:13 -> 01:00:21]  My other petals here, I'll do a yellow.
[01:00:21 -> 01:00:32]  And I've got my starter, and I'm going to take a petal, and I'm going to cover it.
[01:00:32 -> 01:00:36]  So I've covered up with a petal.
[01:00:36 -> 01:00:40]  Now I've covered it with two petals.
[01:00:40 -> 01:00:50]  And now to create a funnel effect, I'm going to take another coffee filter.
[01:00:50 -> 01:00:54]  I'm going to fold it in half.
[01:00:54 -> 01:01:01]  I'm going to fold it over a quarter, just like we did with our rosebud.
[01:01:01 -> 01:01:05]  So you've got a quarter inch little fold.
[01:01:05 -> 01:01:09]  And I'm going to create my funnel.
[01:01:09 -> 01:01:22]  So I've got my funnel, and I'm going to fit my rosebud into that.
[01:01:22 -> 01:01:27]  And we're going to do the same thing as we did with the other rose.
[01:01:27 -> 01:01:34]  We're going to take our petal, we're going to put it over it.
[01:01:34 -> 01:01:40]  We want our petal to be longer.
[01:01:40 -> 01:01:46]  And then we're going to glue it.
[01:01:46 -> 01:01:59]  I'm going to take the next petal, slightly overlap, turn it over, and place.
[01:01:59 -> 01:02:01]  There we go.
[01:02:01 -> 01:02:04]  So it looks like this.
[01:02:04 -> 01:02:11]  And it's longer than our little cone that we made.
[01:02:11 -> 01:02:16]  So now we're going to do the same thing as we did with the other flowers.
[01:02:16 -> 01:02:26]  We're going to take our three leaves, glue it a little bit further down so that it's going to cover the base of this flower.
[01:02:26 -> 01:02:36]  And there we go, all of them is covered.
[01:02:36 -> 01:02:44]  Then we're going to do the same thing, wet our fingers, working from the outside in.
[01:02:44 -> 01:02:55]  And I always start rolling down the sides of the first outer petals so that you've got this effect.
[01:02:55 -> 01:02:58]  And I will alternate sides.
[01:02:58 -> 01:03:02]  How much you dampen your hands, you can't seem to get a hold of it.
[01:03:02 -> 01:03:06]  And that's, I think, the dye, the food colouring.
[01:03:06 -> 01:03:09]  So it's time to wash your hands with soap and come back.
[01:03:09 -> 01:03:12]  That's much better, I'll have a better grip.
[01:03:12 -> 01:03:15]  Moisten your fingers.
[01:03:15 -> 01:03:17]  So there you go.
[01:03:17 -> 01:03:27]  So you've got a rose that, just by rolling back the petals, you're now creating another texture.
[01:03:27 -> 01:03:30]  And you've got that little funnel inside.
[01:03:30 -> 01:03:35]  So it creates a little bit of a different shape.
[01:03:35 -> 01:03:41]  So here's the rose with the funnel in the middle, which took the extra filter.
[01:03:41 -> 01:03:44]  Here's the rose without the funnel in the middle.
[01:03:44 -> 01:03:47]  So it makes them slightly different.
[01:03:47 -> 01:03:53]  You have a variety of shaped roses.
[01:03:53 -> 01:03:57]  It makes it more interesting in your vase for certain.
[01:03:57 -> 01:04:02]  And I know that the curling of the leaves may take a little bit of practice,
[01:04:02 -> 01:04:08]  but it really, really gives it such a realistic look.
[01:04:08 -> 01:04:15]  Now the finale is, of course, just adding the leaves to it.
[01:04:15 -> 01:04:20]  Rose that we can add to our bouquet.
[01:04:20 -> 01:04:24]  Now that was the small rose.
[01:04:24 -> 01:04:35]  And for the large rose, it's the exact same thing as we did for the small rose.
[01:04:35 -> 01:04:45]  But the only difference is that in the small rose, we actually folded.
[01:04:45 -> 01:04:47]  We had four folds.
[01:04:47 -> 01:04:50]  In the large rose, three folds.
[01:04:50 -> 01:04:56]  So your petal for the large rose is going to be larger.
[01:04:56 -> 01:05:00]  I'll show you.
[01:05:00 -> 01:05:04]  And you're only going to fold it over twice.
[01:05:04 -> 01:05:09]  So you can see the difference in size of the two.
[01:05:09 -> 01:05:12]  I didn't end up using all of the 18 petals.
[01:05:12 -> 01:05:15]  It just made too thick of a rose.
[01:05:15 -> 01:05:20]  I did end up having three petals left over.
[01:05:20 -> 01:05:22]  And I thought that was a great size.
[01:05:22 -> 01:05:29]  But basically you are going through the exact same steps to make a larger rose.
[01:05:29 -> 01:05:31]  You're just using larger petals.
[01:05:31 -> 01:05:35]  So that's the video on how to make these long stem roses.
[01:05:35 -> 01:05:39]  I think they turned out amazingly beautiful.
[01:05:39 -> 01:05:40]  Look at that.
[01:05:40 -> 01:05:44]  I feel like I'm at the florist with all these flowers.
[01:05:44 -> 01:05:49]  It's fantastic that you can make all this out of coffee filters.
[01:05:49 -> 01:05:50]  It's really amazing.
[01:05:50 -> 01:05:53]  Plus it's a fun project to work on.
[01:05:53 -> 01:05:57]  If you wanted to make the roses look even more realistic,
[01:05:57 -> 01:06:01]  I would add some filler like Baby's Breath or some greenery.
[01:06:01 -> 01:06:04]  And one last tip that I found works really well,
[01:06:04 -> 01:06:09]  I use an air freshener on my roses.
[01:06:09 -> 01:06:11]  Just a light mist.
[01:06:11 -> 01:06:16]  I've got some beautiful tea rose air mist or air freshener
[01:06:16 -> 01:06:19]  that you can lightly mist the roses.
[01:06:19 -> 01:06:23]  And the coffee filter actually retains the scent for quite some time.
[01:06:24 -> 01:06:29]  So you can have the beautiful fragrance of the roses in the room
[01:06:29 -> 01:06:31]  and the beautiful roses to look at.
[01:06:31 -> 01:06:34]  So I hope that you enjoyed this video.
[01:06:34 -> 01:06:37]  Thank you so much for all the people who watched my last video
[01:06:37 -> 01:06:40]  on making roses in Hydrangeas.
[01:06:40 -> 01:06:43]  And all the people who have subscribed.
[01:06:43 -> 01:06:46]  That tells me that you are enjoying what I'm doing
[01:06:46 -> 01:06:48]  and you'd like to see more.
[01:06:48 -> 01:06:49]  I've got lots of ideas.
[01:06:49 -> 01:06:52]  So I hope you try these roses.
[01:06:52 -> 01:06:54]  And if you like them, I hope you share them.
[01:06:54 -> 01:06:55]  Enjoy!
[01:07:22 -> 01:07:23]  Bye!
