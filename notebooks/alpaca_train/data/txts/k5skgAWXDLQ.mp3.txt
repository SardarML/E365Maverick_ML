[00:00:00 -> 00:00:11]  Hello and thanks for watching this Acumatica video on customer contracts.
[00:00:11 -> 00:00:16]  So today we're going to go through the setup, activate, and renewal process of a relatively
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:18]  simple contract.
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:24]  This contract will be for software where we have our setup fee and then our renewal fee.
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:27]  So to get started, let's create a new contract.
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:28]  We'll give it an ID.
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:31]  In Acumatica you can auto-sequence this if you want.
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:36]  We'll give it a contract template.
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:39]  And the contract template will bring in a lot of our settings.
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:44]  So these settings include how long the term is, what the renewal period and the grace
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:49]  period is, who to bill, how to bill them.
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:55]  So let's take a quick look at the contract template and then we'll finish our contract.
[00:00:55 -> 00:01:02]  So the contract template has a certain type, renewable, expiring, and unlimited.
[00:01:02 -> 00:01:07]  Expiring is essentially the period, the duration of the contract.
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:10]  But at the end, you can't renew it.
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:14]  Renewable is similar but you can continue to renew it at the end of the period.
[00:01:14 -> 00:01:17]  Unlimited means the contract has no end date.
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:20]  It just goes on forever.
[00:01:20 -> 00:01:24]  And this may be applicable if you're using the contract to do, for example, a monthly
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:25]  billing.
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:28]  So here's our duration.
[00:01:28 -> 00:01:33]  So it's one year, but we can choose different increments here if we want to.
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:41]  If the contract is refundable, we turn this on here, the refund period within 30 days.
[00:01:41 -> 00:01:45]  Mass renewal allows us to open up a process screen where we can see all of our contracts
[00:01:45 -> 00:01:48]  and renew them from one place.
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:53]  But if you want to handhold this contract, then you may uncheck this.
[00:01:53 -> 00:01:56]  Our renewal period is 30 days before it expires.
[00:01:56 -> 00:02:02]  This means that inside the contract, we can do an actions renew 30 days prior to the expiration.
[00:02:02 -> 00:02:04]  So we have that window.
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:09]  It also means that after the expiration date, we still have 30 days before we can renew
[00:02:09 -> 00:02:11]  the contract.
[00:02:11 -> 00:02:16]  After that 30-day period, the contract will be set to expire and the only thing you could
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:20]  do is create a new contract.
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:24]  These enable items allow us to override the contract template.
[00:02:24 -> 00:02:28]  So the detailed items which are shown here, can I override those?
[00:02:28 -> 00:02:32]  Well, I can if I turn this on.
[00:02:32 -> 00:02:37]  When I generate an invoice from a contract, do I want to automatically release or look
[00:02:37 -> 00:02:38]  at the invoice and release it manually?
[00:02:38 -> 00:02:41]  I'm going to keep that off.
[00:02:41 -> 00:02:46]  This contract template that we're creating right now has an effective date as of January
[00:02:46 -> 00:02:48]  2012.
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:51]  And it's no longer valid after this date.
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:56]  We don't have that turned on, but you can make these templates go active and expire
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:00]  after a certain period of time.
[00:03:00 -> 00:03:08]  Contracts have a setup, an activation, have a billing period, potentially, and a renewal
[00:03:08 -> 00:03:10]  period.
[00:03:10 -> 00:03:16]  And these different areas of the contract go into effect based on the timing of the
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:17]  contract.
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:23]  And one of these settings gives us the ability to continually bill on a regular basis from
[00:03:23 -> 00:03:25]  this contract.
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:30]  So for example, I can have this automatically have a recurring fee monthly of a certain
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:32]  amount if I turn that on.
[00:03:32 -> 00:03:38]  If I don't need that, and in this case, because we're just renewing this software at the end
[00:03:38 -> 00:03:45]  of the year, we're not going to use this setting, we'll set it to on demand.
[00:03:45 -> 00:03:48]  If you are doing recurring billing, who do you bill?
[00:03:48 -> 00:03:49]  Is it the customer?
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:51]  Is it another account altogether?
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:53]  Or is it the parent of the customer?
[00:03:53 -> 00:03:56]  And then when does the billing schedule start?
[00:03:56 -> 00:03:59]  Acumatica has a setup and an activation date.
[00:03:59 -> 00:04:05]  Setup is a setup period of time where it maybe takes you some period of time to provision
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:07]  software for example.
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:12]  But do we want to start the billing at that setup time or after the activation?
[00:04:12 -> 00:04:17]  There's another period of time in the contract called the activation that you can run it.
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:24]  And then this recurring billing can occur at that time instead of this time.
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:30]  When I generate a bill, do I want every line item from details to show up in the invoice
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:32]  or do I just want one summary line item?
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:34]  That's your option here.
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:38]  And this gives us the invoice and line descriptions.
[00:04:38 -> 00:04:41]  So when we generate an invoice, invoices have descriptions.
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:44]  Those descriptions show up inside the invoice form.
[00:04:44 -> 00:04:47]  They also show on the invoice printout.
[00:04:47 -> 00:04:50]  They even show up on the customer statements.
[00:04:50 -> 00:04:51]  So they're pretty useful.
[00:04:51 -> 00:04:55]  And how do you want those descriptions to be formatted?
[00:04:55 -> 00:05:01]  You can click here and pull out any fields from the contract and have them show up on
[00:05:01 -> 00:05:04]  the invoice.
[00:05:04 -> 00:05:06]  Same thing with the line items.
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:13]  If we were doing a case count, for example, in this contract you get five cases per month,
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:18]  then we'd use a non-stock item here.
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:21]  These are the details of the contract.
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:27]  So as we mentioned before, there's a setup, there's a recurring, that's the billing settings,
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:29]  and there's a renewal.
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:36]  In this case, software license 01 is $10,000 and it renews at $10,000.
[00:05:36 -> 00:05:41]  The second line item here, it's setups for $4,000 and then at the renewal we only charge
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:43]  $800.
[00:05:43 -> 00:05:48]  So let's go back into our contract and let's continue to set it up.
[00:05:48 -> 00:05:51]  So we'll pick our customer.
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:54]  We can choose the location.
[00:05:54 -> 00:05:58]  We have a setup date, an activation date, and an expiration date.
[00:05:58 -> 00:06:02]  Again, the setup date could be maybe 10 days before.
[00:06:02 -> 00:06:08]  Maybe it takes a few days for your IT team to get things set up for the customer.
[00:06:08 -> 00:06:11]  But in this case, it's 6-3 and 6-3.
[00:06:11 -> 00:06:16]  The expiration date is calculated based on that year that we defined.
[00:06:16 -> 00:06:22]  Our renewal point and grace period came in from the contract template, as did our billing
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:26]  information and our invoice and line formulas.
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:29]  So here's our details for the contract.
[00:06:29 -> 00:06:34]  These are the two line items, and they have a setup, a recurring amount of zero, and a
[00:06:34 -> 00:06:37]  renewal price.
[00:06:37 -> 00:06:44]  Now if we click on this item code, this is actually a contract item.
[00:06:44 -> 00:06:49]  And we call it a contract item because it's specific for contracts.
[00:06:49 -> 00:06:52]  It's not just, for example, a non-stock item.
[00:06:52 -> 00:06:57]  So some of the things that make this different than a typical non-stock item, first off is
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:01]  what is the quantity that I want to use in contracts?
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:06]  In this case, we always want to use quantity one for this contract item.
[00:07:06 -> 00:07:11]  So maximum, minimum, and this is the default.
[00:07:11 -> 00:07:17]  When we generate an invoice based on the setup, what non-stock item code do we want to use?
[00:07:17 -> 00:07:23]  The reason we have that is our non-stock items carry a few pieces of information that we
[00:07:23 -> 00:07:26]  still need to generate an invoice.
[00:07:26 -> 00:07:33]  We need to know how do we bill it, for example, what GL accounts to use, so our posting class.
[00:07:33 -> 00:07:35]  We need to know, for example, the price.
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:40]  In this case, we're taking the default price over $10,000.
[00:07:40 -> 00:07:42]  And we need to know what GL accounts to use.
[00:07:42 -> 00:07:46]  So if the posting class is pointing back to the item, what's our revenue account here?
[00:07:46 -> 00:07:50]  In this case, it's $40,000.
[00:07:50 -> 00:07:55]  So that's why we have contract items and then non-stock items inside of them.
[00:07:55 -> 00:07:58]  And a better example of that is the renewal item.
[00:07:58 -> 00:08:02]  We may need to use a different renewal item than the setup item.
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:07]  And the reason for that is because perhaps we want to track new sales versus renewal sales.
[00:08:10 -> 00:08:15]  And notice right here, we can use the item codes price, the non-stock items code price,
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:18]  or we can choose a specific amount.
[00:08:19 -> 00:08:22]  So $10,090.
[00:08:22 -> 00:08:29]  And maybe our renewal price will be $10,800.
[00:08:29 -> 00:08:31]  It's going to go up a little bit.
[00:08:31 -> 00:08:34]  Here's our summary of those charges.
[00:08:34 -> 00:08:36]  Our recurring billing is none.
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:39]  So therefore, all of this is grayed out.
[00:08:39 -> 00:08:41]  So let's save this.
[00:08:41 -> 00:08:43]  Let's go back.
[00:08:44 -> 00:08:50]  And what you can see here is these are still grayed out because these items were added before.
[00:08:50 -> 00:08:55]  But if I go here and I delete this and I add this line item again,
[00:08:59 -> 00:09:04]  I can now edit these numbers because these numbers were defined in the contract item.
[00:09:07 -> 00:09:12]  I can't edit this because this one pulls from the non-stock item itself.
[00:09:13 -> 00:09:17]  And because we allow enable override in our contract template,
[00:09:17 -> 00:09:20]  this allows us to make changes to this on the fly.
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:23]  So this way, we can negotiate our pricing with the customer
[00:09:23 -> 00:09:27]  and make changes when we get to creating the contract.
[00:09:27 -> 00:09:30]  You can also use promo codes here.
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:35]  So you can have certain discounts set up and then use them here
[00:09:35 -> 00:09:41]  if the customer is maybe taking advantage of a certain discount that you're running, promo.
[00:09:41 -> 00:09:45]  Recurring summary would show up here if we were using the billing settings.
[00:09:45 -> 00:09:47]  We're not.
[00:09:47 -> 00:09:52]  Our contract history gives us the ability to keep track of what's happened with this contract.
[00:09:52 -> 00:09:55]  It was created on this date by this user.
[00:09:56 -> 00:10:01]  And then if we go in here and we set up and activate this contract,
[00:10:01 -> 00:10:04]  we'll do so on this 6-3 date.
[00:10:05 -> 00:10:08]  Now you can see this extra event that's occurred.
[00:10:08 -> 00:10:11]  So we can keep track of what's going on here.
[00:10:11 -> 00:10:17]  If we go over to AR history, we can see the invoice that was generated from our contract.
[00:10:17 -> 00:10:19]  Let's take a look at it.
[00:10:19 -> 00:10:24]  Because we're showing detail, we can see the two contract items.
[00:10:24 -> 00:10:28]  We can see the setup fee of $800.
[00:10:28 -> 00:10:33]  This particular customer is getting a number of different line discounts
[00:10:33 -> 00:10:36]  that they're eligible for automatically.
[00:10:36 -> 00:10:40]  Now when we're ready to renew this, we can come to Actions and click Renew,
[00:10:40 -> 00:10:42]  or we can go to Contract.
[00:10:42 -> 00:10:45]  Under Processes, we can do our Renew Contracts.
[00:10:45 -> 00:10:50]  Any contracts that are eligible through that 60-day period we talked about,
[00:10:50 -> 00:10:52]  the grace period and the renewal period,
[00:10:52 -> 00:10:54]  they'll all show up here.
[00:10:54 -> 00:10:59]  You can choose and move this date forward or backwards to do all your renewals.
[00:10:59 -> 00:11:03]  And this gives you a quick idea of how to use Acumatica
[00:11:03 -> 00:11:08]  to bill a contract and then renew it at a given period.
[00:11:08 -> 00:11:13]  Could be monthly, could be quarterly, could be yearly in this case is what we did.
[00:11:13 -> 00:11:15]  We're generating all our invoices.
[00:11:15 -> 00:11:20]  We're keeping track of who's doing the work with the contracts.
[00:11:20 -> 00:11:23]  And this allows us to ensure we don't miss any invoices
[00:11:23 -> 00:11:26]  that are supposed to go out the door for our customers.
[00:11:26 -> 00:11:29]  And an opportunity to upgrade the customer.
[00:11:29 -> 00:11:33]  So in our next video, we'll talk about how we can use contracts
[00:11:33 -> 00:11:38]  to generate invoices based on billable activities
[00:11:38 -> 00:11:42]  using our support case management system.
[00:11:42 -> 00:11:44]  But that's it for now.
[00:11:44 -> 00:11:48]  If you have any questions, our contact information is at the end of the video.
[00:11:48 -> 00:11:50]  Thanks so much for watching.
