[00:00:00 -> 00:00:29]  ðŸŽµ
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:32]  Here's a scenario for you.
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:35]  You just spent this wonderful Sunday at the local aquarium,
[00:00:35 -> 00:00:39]  and you saw a bunch of exotic fish, and you got to see their behavior.
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:42]  And your daughter gets so excited on the way home,
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:46]  she tells you about the aquarium she has in her school.
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:52]  Now, later that night, there's a segment on divers getting up close and personal with sharks.
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:55]  This shark is munching down on the bait bag right now.
[00:00:55 -> 00:00:57]  And your son gets so excited, he goes,
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:04]  and your son gets so excited, he goes online and follows the conversation live.
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:11]  The fact is, an awful lot of science learning goes on outside of the classroom.
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:16]  It goes on in libraries and museums and nature centers and after-school groups,
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:21]  and sometimes in conversations around the dinner table.
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:25]  We're really expanding our idea about where people can learn science
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:29]  and how they can kind of put their knowledge of science together across their lives,
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:33]  putting together what they learn in school with what they learn outside of school.
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:37]  We've come to understand that proficiency in one aspect of science
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:43]  is very closely related to proficiency in another, like strands of a rope.
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:46]  The strands of scientific proficiency are intertwined.
[00:01:46 -> 00:01:48]  The strands support each other,
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:53]  so that progress along one strand promotes progress along another.
[00:01:53 -> 00:01:59]  The six strands allow me to find a road map on the experiences I want to provide
[00:01:59 -> 00:02:01]  or experiences I want to have for myself.
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:06]  So it's this nice lens for broadening how we think about what it means to learn science
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:11]  and the kinds of experiences we provide to people to learn science.
[00:02:13 -> 00:02:15]  Interest, motivation, excitement.
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:20]  That part of the strand is probably the easy one to recognize.
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:25]  If you get an amateur astronomer out there in a starry night
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:28]  to not only observe through the telescope,
[00:02:28 -> 00:02:31]  but then share that with people at a star party,
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:35]  excitedly speaking about how wonderful it is to see the moons of Jupiter
[00:02:35 -> 00:02:37]  through that telescope and say,
[00:02:37 -> 00:02:39]  look, this is not just an image of Jupiter.
[00:02:39 -> 00:02:41]  This is Jupiter.
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:45]  Strand 2, Understanding Scientific Knowledge,
[00:02:45 -> 00:02:48]  really emphasizes a deeper understanding,
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:50]  understanding the relationships between ideas
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:53]  and being able to provide more sophisticated explanations.
[00:02:53 -> 00:02:55]  So it's not just the factoid answer,
[00:02:55 -> 00:02:59]  it's really explanations about that answer.
[00:02:59 -> 00:03:03]  So if you learn something about a dinosaur and you use something about evolution,
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:07]  you might come to understand how it is that the dinosaur could be related to birds.
[00:03:10 -> 00:03:14]  While this strand includes what is usually categorized as content,
[00:03:15 -> 00:03:20]  it focuses on concepts and the links between them rather than on discrete facts.
[00:03:20 -> 00:03:25]  And it also includes the ability to use that knowledge in a person's own life.
[00:03:27 -> 00:03:30]  The point of being able to reason from evidence
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:33]  is the notion that science is changing all the time.
[00:03:33 -> 00:03:37]  The nature of science lies in the fact that it looks at evidence
[00:03:37 -> 00:03:41]  and it corrects itself, it builds on things that are solid,
[00:03:41 -> 00:03:43]  new ideas are being created,
[00:03:43 -> 00:03:47]  and what people should do when they're proficient in science
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:51]  and competent in science is understand that reasoning,
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:55]  making logical arguments based on evidence, is helpful.
[00:03:55 -> 00:03:59]  And many informal environments give people the opportunity to test,
[00:03:59 -> 00:04:02]  to explore, to examine, to manipulate,
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:05]  to get a feel for the physical and natural world.
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:09]  And it's that sort of experience that allows the visitor
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:12]  to actually engage in scientific reasoning.
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:16]  We can learn new things about the world
[00:04:16 -> 00:04:20]  and it might mean we need to update our explanations of the world.
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:24]  Often historical examples can be a really good way of helping people
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:28]  to understand how scientific knowledge emerges over time
[00:04:28 -> 00:04:31]  and is reshaped as new evidence comes in.
[00:04:33 -> 00:04:37]  There are many, many opportunities, both informal as well as mostly informal settings,
[00:04:37 -> 00:04:39]  that allow people to take part
[00:04:39 -> 00:04:42]  and thereby become much more knowledgeable
[00:04:42 -> 00:04:46]  about the way in which having scientific tools and language
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:49]  helps communicate and do work.
[00:04:49 -> 00:04:52]  In terms of language, we don't just mean the wacky terms
[00:04:52 -> 00:04:54]  that scientists come up with.
[00:04:54 -> 00:04:56]  It's also the way you frame an argument.
[00:04:56 -> 00:04:59]  The strength of your argument rests on the strength of your evidence
[00:04:59 -> 00:05:02]  and how well your explanation fits the data.
[00:05:02 -> 00:05:04]  By engaging in scientific activities,
[00:05:04 -> 00:05:08]  people actually gain greater facility with the language of science.
[00:05:08 -> 00:05:14]  Terms like hypothesis and control group and experiment and data analysis
[00:05:14 -> 00:05:16]  start to feel more familiar
[00:05:16 -> 00:05:21]  and non-scientists can gain entry into the culture of the scientific community.
[00:05:24 -> 00:05:27]  Again, it's this idea that science is for everyone,
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:29]  that we don't want to exclude anybody
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:32]  and that to give people an opportunity to be part of science
[00:05:32 -> 00:05:34]  in as much as they want and as little as they want,
[00:05:34 -> 00:05:36]  based on their own preference
[00:05:36 -> 00:05:39]  rather than based on prejudice or fear
[00:05:39 -> 00:05:42]  or a sense of lack of empowerment.
[00:05:42 -> 00:05:45]  The question between formal learning and informal learning is
[00:05:45 -> 00:05:49]  to what degree does formal learning provide you with a foundation
[00:05:49 -> 00:05:52]  that allows you to continue an individual lifelong learning path
[00:05:52 -> 00:05:57]  that is then lifelong, as they say, life-wide and life-deep.
[00:05:57 -> 00:06:01]  You don't, in every science learning experience at every moment,
[00:06:01 -> 00:06:04]  have to highlight all six strands.
[00:06:04 -> 00:06:08]  They can sort of come in and out and trade off across your experiences.
[00:06:08 -> 00:06:11]  It's looking over the whole arc of time.
[00:06:11 -> 00:06:15]  Informal environments have often been recognized
[00:06:15 -> 00:06:18]  as critically important in developing positive,
[00:06:18 -> 00:06:22]  science-specific interests, attitudes, and identities.
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:27]  Designers and educators can realize those goals for people of all ages
[00:06:27 -> 00:06:31]  by portraying science as a social, lived experience
[00:06:31 -> 00:06:33]  relevant to people's lives.
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:38]  The fact is, learning science outside the school is fun,
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:40]  it's exciting, it's engaging,
[00:06:40 -> 00:06:43]  and we now know that all of those qualities
[00:06:43 -> 00:06:46]  are essential to effective science learning.
