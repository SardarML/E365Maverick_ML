 Microeconomics versus macroeconomics. The study of economics is divided into two major branches  microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics comes from the Greek word  mikros meaning small. Microeconomics deals with the behavior of individual actors in the economy  it can mean one consumer, one household, one firm or even one industry. Some questions we aim to answer in  microeconomics are if price of cars go up what happens to consumer demand? If income levels of  people increase how will demand for meat change? So microeconomics deals with the individual parts of the economy  when you hear microeconomics think small. Macroeconomics comes from the Greek word  makros meaning big. In macroeconomics we are interested in the economy as a whole  for example the country's unemployment rate, changes in prices of goods or inflation  national income which is often referred as GDP. Some questions we try to answer in macroeconomics are  what happens if money supply increase? What causes the economy to grow over time?  So in a nutshell macroeconomics studies the economy as a whole. When you hear macroeconomics think big  and you know what? Microeconomics and macroeconomics are interrelated. To understand macroeconomics  we got to understand microeconomics. For instance a typical question we ask in macroeconomics is  when interest rates go down how will GDP change? To answer this question we need to first understand microeconomics  how will a consumer respond to an interest rate drop? Will a consumer start saving less?  How will a firm respond to an interest rate drop? Will a firm start investing more?  Once we understand the behaviours of individual agents we can then understand the economy as a whole.
