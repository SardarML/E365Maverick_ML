[00:00:00 -> 00:00:07]  There are many reasons people seek out a speech coach, but all of them usually fall into three
[00:00:07 -> 00:00:14]  broad categories, clarity, confidence, and credibility.
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:21]  Every client that walks into my office is concerned with at least one of those issues,
[00:00:21 -> 00:00:28]  and every improvement we seek is aimed at reinforcing those three critical traits.
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:37]  Clarity is often considered with regard to content, structuring your thoughts in a logical
[00:00:37 -> 00:00:44]  manner and choosing the right words. But good communication requires more than just language.
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:50]  It takes more than just your mouth and your brains.
[00:00:50 -> 00:00:57]  To communicate well, you must do more than just say the words. You must make sure your
[00:00:58 -> 00:01:05]  listeners get the message. It's easy to overlook that final phase of the process when you
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:14]  have the advantage of knowing what you're about to say before you've said it.
[00:01:14 -> 00:01:21]  Don't assume you're being clear just because you've said the words. Here are some common
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:28]  obstacles to clarity. Addressing these issues will ensure you have the communication skills
[00:01:28 -> 00:01:35]  to be consistently and easily understood.
[00:01:35 -> 00:01:42]  Fast rate is one of the most common causes of unclear speech. Vowel sounds get shortened
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:49]  and words become a jumble of consonants. Slowing the speed of your speech gives you time to
[00:01:51 -> 00:01:58]  form sounds accurately and gives your listeners time to absorb what you've said.
[00:02:00 -> 00:02:07]  Learning to breathe deeply while speaking is one of the most effective strategies for
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:10]  slowing down naturally.
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:17]  Mumbling often goes hand in hand with fast speech. When you speak quickly, your mouth
[00:02:18 -> 00:02:25]  doesn't have time to open very far, so speech sounds get distorted being squeezed through
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:28]  your teeth.
[00:02:28 -> 00:02:35]  Practicing jaw and tongue relaxation creates more openness in your mouth and encourages
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:42]  more precision in the formation of vowels and consonants.
[00:02:42 -> 00:02:49]  A quiet voice often contributes to a lack of clarity. When you're not putting enough
[00:02:49 -> 00:02:56]  sound into the room, your listeners have nothing to work with. Using more breath, feeling sound
[00:02:58 -> 00:03:05]  vibrations in your body, and inviting your voice to fill the room will generate more
[00:03:06 -> 00:03:10]  power without straining.
[00:03:10 -> 00:03:17]  Remember, your voice will seem louder to you than it sounds to your listeners. Get used
[00:03:18 -> 00:03:20]  to it.
[00:03:20 -> 00:03:27]  An accent can make it difficult for others to understand you, especially if it's combined
[00:03:27 -> 00:03:32]  with a quiet voice or fast speech.
[00:03:32 -> 00:03:39]  Learning to master a few strategically selected language skills can produce dramatic improvements
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:47]  in clarity. But before you invest in accent training, make sure you're speaking slowly
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:57]  and projecting well. In many cases, that's all that's required to get the clarity you
[00:03:57 -> 00:04:00]  need.
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:07]  Failure to speak clearly is not a minor inconvenience. It has serious implications for your personal
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:14]  image and your professional success.
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:21]  When people struggle to understand you, they eventually ignore you. Addressing the common
[00:04:23 -> 00:04:30]  underlying causes enables you to communicate fluently and distinctly.
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:38]  Enhancing clarity not only strengthens your communication skills, it improves your image
[00:04:38 -> 00:04:44]  and makes others more responsive to your message.
