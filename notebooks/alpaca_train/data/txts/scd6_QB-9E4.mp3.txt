[00:00:00 -> 00:00:03]  Hello everyone and welcome to our channel.
[00:00:13 -> 00:00:20]  For this video, we will discuss the significance of this study. We will focus first on the
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:27]  concept of significance, the criteria of significance, and we will give you writing
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:32]  tips and examples for you to be able to write your significance of this study.
[00:00:35 -> 00:00:43]  First, research significance is determined by our statement of the problem and its general and
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:51]  specific contributions to the field of knowledge. Let's have first the key terms. If we say
[00:00:51 -> 00:00:58]  significance, it suggests the importance or the contribution and the benefit that is to be
[00:00:58 -> 00:01:06]  derived from our study. If we say study, this pertains to our research investigation which
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:14]  is the critical examination or investigation using scientific analysis of any subject matter.
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:21]  And we will have the significance of this study. This pertains to the reason, to the
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:29]  justification that shares the contributions of our research work towards a body of knowledge.
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:38]  Now, significance of this study could either be general significance or specific significance.
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:45]  If it is general significance, it's about how our study will contribute to the whole society.
[00:01:45 -> 00:01:51]  And if we say specific significance, this pertains to the enumerated individuals,
[00:01:51 -> 00:01:58]  corporate bodies, government, and agencies and how they will benefit from our study.
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:06]  Let's have the criteria of general significance. We have eight general significance of our study.
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:16]  In this part, we may classify how our study will contribute. Either our study will contribute
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:22]  to knowledge of an enduring practice if our study provides knowledge about an enduring
[00:02:22 -> 00:02:28]  educational practice or it's a new research problem that has not been investigated in the
[00:02:28 -> 00:02:35]  field. Our study could also provide the significance about theory testing if it
[00:02:35 -> 00:02:41]  tests theories in different situation or population or if it verifies an existing theory.
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:50]  Next, our study could have its significance coming from generalizability, especially for
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:58]  quantitative researches having the following instances like testing if results is generalizable
[00:02:58 -> 00:03:06]  to different population or practices, enhanced generalizability of result, replicating studies,
[00:03:06 -> 00:03:13]  and involving other variables. Our study could also extend the understanding, especially if
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:19]  our study is a qualitative one. If our study provides an understanding of the phenomena
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:25]  or if our study provides an image or configuration of reasonable expectation,
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:33]  it is an extension of understanding. Our study could also provide methodological advancement
[00:03:33 -> 00:03:40]  as its significance. Either our study increases the validity and reliability of an instrument,
[00:03:41 -> 00:03:49]  uses a method different from the usual methods used in the previous studies, or either our study
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:55]  will be able to develop an analytical methodological technique and elaborate on
[00:03:55 -> 00:04:03]  its usefulness in conducting a research. And of course, our study could also be significant
[00:04:03 -> 00:04:13]  for current issues or social issues of immediate concern. And second to the last, our study could be
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:22]  beneficial in terms of evaluating practice or policy. Either our study will evaluate a specific
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:29]  practice or policy for decision makers at a given site or for external groups, either it will
[00:04:29 -> 00:04:37]  determine the worth of a practice or policy, or our study may supply information for immediate use
[00:04:37 -> 00:04:45]  in site decision making. And last but not the least, our study could be very significant
[00:04:45 -> 00:04:52]  if it is about exploration of a new field of study, whereas we will be investigating
[00:04:52 -> 00:04:59]  new areas of inquiry or we will examine phenomena that have not been studied previously.
[00:05:00 -> 00:05:07]  Again, we have eight general significance of our study could be knowledge of an enduring
[00:05:07 -> 00:05:13]  practice, theory testing, generalizability, extensions of understanding, methodological
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:20]  advancement, current issues, evaluation of practice or policy, and exploration of a field.
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:28]  In introducing your significance of this study, you may focus in any of the following if
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:37]  it is applicable to your study. Make sure that you were able to mention and explicate
[00:05:37 -> 00:05:45]  those general significance of your study. Here is the critical substance in explaining
[00:05:45 -> 00:05:50]  this study's significance. So you should explain the need for the research and its
[00:05:50 -> 00:05:56]  specific contribution. You should also justify the importance and the impact of your study.
[00:05:57 -> 00:06:03]  Make sure that the study significance is aligned with the research problem and the gap you are
[00:06:03 -> 00:06:12]  addressing. Make sure your beneficiaries and benefits are specified and these beneficiaries
[00:06:12 -> 00:06:20]  and benefits are arranged in a hierarchical order. Make sure you state how to improve the
[00:06:20 -> 00:06:26]  quality of life and well-being of people. Your research work may be significant for
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:32]  educational institutions, policy makers, administrators, teachers, parents, students,
[00:06:32 -> 00:06:38]  researchers, and national and international stakeholders, just to name a few.
[00:06:39 -> 00:06:44]  But of course, you can add others as long as it's applicable to your study.
[00:06:46 -> 00:06:52]  Now, how to write the significance of your study? First, you may provide an introductory paragraph
[00:06:52 -> 00:06:59]  telling the general benefit from this study being conducted. Then, specify the benefits and the
[00:06:59 -> 00:07:06]  beneficiaries and how they will benefit from your study. And then, you may write in italic case
[00:07:06 -> 00:07:11]  identifying the individuals or group of individuals as beneficiaries. And in epiparagraph
[00:07:11 -> 00:07:18]  form, you tell the ways the mentioned individuals will be able to benefit from either tangible
[00:07:18 -> 00:07:26]  or intangible research product coming from the result of your study. And for the last part of
[00:07:26 -> 00:07:32]  your study significance, make sure that you restate the overall research significance focusing
[00:07:32 -> 00:07:39]  on the research gap. We already have a discussion about the research gap and I hope
[00:07:39 -> 00:07:45]  you watch it for you to review types of research gap that your study might be addressing.
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:54]  And please take note that efforts must be made to critically explain or describe the specific
[00:07:54 -> 00:08:01]  benefits of this study to each of the identified or listed beneficiary. You may explain
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:06]  how they will be able to benefit from your study.
[00:08:08 -> 00:08:17]  And once again, we hope you learned something about research significance. Happy researching!
