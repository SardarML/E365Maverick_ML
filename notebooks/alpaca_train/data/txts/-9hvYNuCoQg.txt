[00:00:00 -> 00:00:04]  Have you ever wondered, what is phonetics? Have you ever wished that you could pronounce
[00:00:04 -> 00:00:10]  the English phonetic alphabet more clearly and confidently? Well, in this video, these
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:18]  are exactly the things I'm going to help you to do.
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:23]  So phonetics is essentially the study and classification of speech sounds. And we have
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:28]  something called the International Phonetic Alphabet Chart, which is an internationally
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:33]  recognised set of phonetic symbols that was developed in the late 19th century. And we
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:39]  use them to be very specific about the pronunciation of a word in whichever language we're working
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:44]  on. And some people find them to be the most accurate and the most reliable way to work
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:48]  on their pronunciation, because you can go to a good dictionary, like the Oxford Dictionary
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:54]  or Cambridge Dictionary, which are both online, and you can see the phonetic symbols and it'll
[00:00:54 -> 00:00:59]  tell you how to pronounce that part of that word. So they're a really great resource.
[00:00:59 -> 00:01:04]  And what I thought would might be useful, even though the internet is filled with videos
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:08]  about this sort of stuff, is just to sort of contain it all in one video and give you
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:13]  those phonetic symbols and make the sound so that you can practice and get more confident
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:17]  with them. And then you can go to a dictionary and if you see that symbol, you know which
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:21]  sound to use. So here they are.
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:26]  So we're going to look at the consonant sounds. And when we're talking about sounds in isolation,
[00:01:26 -> 00:01:31]  they're sometimes referred to as phonemes. So here are the phonemes for each of the consonants
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:34]  used in standard British English.
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:38]  m as in mum

[00:04:29 -> 00:04:34]  that I wrote that contains absolutely all of these vowels and all of these consonants
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:36]  along with the phonetic transcription.
[00:04:36 -> 00:04:41]  And it covers absolutely everything you need to know with pictures and diagrams.
