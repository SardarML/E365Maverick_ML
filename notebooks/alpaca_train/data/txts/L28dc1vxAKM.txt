[00:00:00 -> 00:00:02]  Protein is vital to your muscles,
[00:00:02 -> 00:00:05]  but do you ever wonder how much you actually need?
[00:00:05 -> 00:00:08]  And are all protein sources created equal?
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:09]  Well, watch now to learn more
[00:00:09 -> 00:00:11]  about what protein can do for you.
[00:00:11 -> 00:00:14]  Hi, I'm sports dietician Tara Collingwood.
[00:00:14 -> 00:00:16]  Let's talk protein today.
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:18]  So protein is absolutely vital to our diet
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:20]  for so many reasons.
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:23]  It helps us to build and repair our cells and muscles,
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:25]  but did you know that it also helps with satiety?
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:28]  So satiety is how long food stays with you.
[00:00:28 -> 00:00:30]  You're staying power.
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:32]  A balanced diet is gonna include
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:33]  a variety of protein sources,
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:36]  and dairy is a high-quality, complete protein
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:39]  containing all of the essential amino acids.
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:42]  The protein in dairy, called whey and casein,
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:43]  helps you to feel full longer
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:46]  and provides energy to fuel your day.
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:48]  Diets higher in dairy protein
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:50]  can help you build and retain that muscle,
[00:00:50 -> 00:00:52]  but also you get adequate calcium
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:55]  to help maintain healthy bones,
[00:00:55 -> 00:00:58]  manage your weight, and control your hunger.
[00:00:58 -> 00:01:01]  So exercise can actually cause muscle breakdown,
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:04]  and high-quality protein like milk, cheese, yogurt,
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:06]  eggs, and lean meats can actually rebuild
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:08]  and repair those muscles.
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:11]  Whey protein is a great choice after a workout
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:13]  as your body can digest it quickly,
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:16]  and it contains the highest content of leucine,
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:18]  which is an amino acid that's been showed
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:22]  to build and repair muscles after a workout.
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:24]  So whey protein powders are another great option
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:28]  and can be added to smoothies made with milk or yogurt.
[00:01:28 -> 00:01:30]  We need protein all day long,
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:32]  so it's best to spread it out at your meals
[00:01:32 -> 00:01:34]  and your snacks throughout the day.
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:36]  In fact, some experts suggest that you benefit
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:39]  from eating 20 to 30 grams of protein at each meal
[00:01:39 -> 00:01:42]  in order to get all that protein in for the day.
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:45]  Aim for protein at breakfast, like milk in your cereal,
[00:01:45 -> 00:01:50]  yogurt, or some eggs, and focus on a good source of protein
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:51]  at lunch and dinner as well.
