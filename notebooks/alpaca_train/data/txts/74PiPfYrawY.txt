[00:00:13 -> 00:00:18]  a chance to subscribe to this channel please do so i want you to ring that notification
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:23]  bell that way when i drop a video you guys will be notified this video is going to be
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:29]  a little bit special to me because my team and i what we did was we went and we scoured
[00:00:29 -> 00:00:35]  the internet to find as much research as we possibly could on what is it going to take
[00:00:35 -> 00:00:42]  for you guys to know what credit score is required for certain credit cards when you
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:47]  guys are building credit and you have the foundation you went out and got your two secure
[00:00:47 -> 00:00:52]  credit cards you got your my jewelers your new coast direct and your self account you
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:57]  want to know what is it going to take for you to get to the next level i made videos
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:04]  talking about don't be a credit hoe and in those videos what i was saying was i don't
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:10]  want you guys to incur a bunch of inquiries on your credit report and so i felt like it
[00:01:10 -> 00:01:16]  was my responsibility to help you guys reduce the inquiries on your credit report so what
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:23]  we did was we put together a lender's list and that way you guys kind of know what credit
[00:01:23 -> 00:01:29]  you can apply for and get approvals for now i'm not saying that if you use this list it's
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:33]  going to guarantee that you're going to get qualified for these credit cards but what
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:39]  i wanted to do was at least put something together for you guys to help reduce your
[00:01:39 -> 00:01:44]  inquiries because what you're doing is you you guys get to like a 650 range and you guys
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:50]  start applying for chase american express and you're getting denied and these inquiries
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:56]  are being put on your credit report and sometimes it doesn't have to be that way but if you
[00:01:56 -> 00:02:02]  don't know what it takes to qualify for those cards then of course you're going to just
[00:02:02 -> 00:02:07]  you're applying blindly and so what i wanted to do like i said as i wanted to put something
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:12]  together for you guys so that when you guys apply for credit cards you have a better chance
[00:02:12 -> 00:02:17]  of getting qualified and that's that's something that's near and dear to my heart because like
[00:02:17 -> 00:02:22]  i said i made a lot of videos about being a credit hoe so let's just dive into the computer
[00:02:22 -> 00:02:27]  i just want to show you this pdf that we put together for you guys and i'm telling you
[00:02:27 -> 00:02:32]  guys up front there's no charge for it just go in the description of this video pick up
[00:02:32 -> 00:02:39]  the pdf and you guys will be able to see exactly what it's going to take to qualify for certain
[00:02:39 -> 00:02:45]  credit cards but let's just go into the video or to the pdf and see exactly what it is that
[00:02:45 -> 00:02:50]  we put together for you guys all right so i hope you enjoy this so if you if you guys

[00:03:01 -> 00:03:07]  guide to building credit because you need to know what is it going to take to qualify
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:12]  for certain loans for certain loans credit cards stuff like that and that's what i've
[00:03:12 -> 00:03:16]  been trying to tell you guys that i'm trying to put together for you guys and as you can
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:21]  see if you go through uh there's a little table of contents here where you guys kind
[00:03:21 -> 00:03:26]  of see what page and as you can see there's quite a few pages to this so it's not little
[00:03:26 -> 00:03:32]  something that i put together it took a lot of work so if you guys appreciate it well
[00:03:32 -> 00:03:38]  i should say i hope you guys appreciate it so uh you have your pre-qualifications you
[00:03:38 -> 00:03:44]  have your secure credit cards on page 11 uh personal and and yes i do have some business
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:51]  credit stuff on page 15 um some of you that are looking for automobile financing um i
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:57]  put some lenders in here that do auto financing and i know i'm gonna get a couple of yahoos
[00:03:57 -> 00:04:01]  out here that's gonna say well what about this company or this company listen i we're
[00:04:01 -> 00:04:07]  trying to put together this isn't finished we're gonna keep adding uh more companies
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:14]  to this as we go but at least you have something to reference a base a good base right and
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:20]  you know we we did put some disclaimers in here um this is for educational purposes only
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:27]  and we cannot guarantee any results or approvals for from our techniques like i said just because
[00:04:27 -> 00:04:33]  you're you may be at a 660 range in the the pdf says that you're going to be at a 660
[00:04:33 -> 00:04:38]  if you were at a 660 you're going to get qualified doesn't necessarily mean you're
[00:04:38 -> 00:04:44]  going to get qualified okay so it just means that you've got a better chance of getting
[00:04:44 -> 00:04:50]  qualified if you're at if it says 660 and you're at a 620 i wouldn't apply for it as
[00:04:50 -> 00:04:56]  of yet okay so i just want you know to make sure that i'm clear on that and that's what
[00:04:56 -> 00:05:01]  this is about we had a little bit of jargon that we wanted to get through um pre-qualified
[00:05:01 -> 00:05:07]  offers capital one business cards require a personal guarantor uh there's a lot of people
[00:05:07 -> 00:05:13]  out here that talk about getting business credit without a personal guarantor i'm gonna
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:18]  talk about that in the future but you know right now we'll the all these cards are going
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:25]  to require a personal guarantee okay so uh bank of america these are all pre-qualifications
[00:05:25 -> 00:05:33]  right if you want to pre-qualify for these um certain cards um you have that but you
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:39]  know of course you have the prosper loans lending club um they do not offer any wells
[00:05:39 -> 00:05:46]  fargo and you guys will see wells fargo don't offer any uh personal secure credit cards
[00:05:46 -> 00:05:51]  anymore and of course this is my favorite section because you guys know how i feel about
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:56]  building credit with secure credit cards don't let them tell you that you can't all
[00:05:56 -> 00:06:02]  right and first of all open sky here's and all these links are clickable so you guys
[00:06:02 -> 00:06:09]  can just go to these links click on the links and go directly to the website so a refundable
[00:06:09 -> 00:06:18]  deposit 200 to 3000 annual fee is 35 dollars first progress uh no credit history and minimum
[00:06:18 -> 00:06:23]  credit score also what you're going to find in this pamphlet this pdf is the fact that
[00:06:23 -> 00:06:30]  um it's going to also show where where it's going to pull from so this one says reports
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:38]  to experience equifax and transunion um to discover it uh two percent one of the only
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:45]  secure credit cards that offer a cash back right and i absolutely love the discover it
[00:06:45 -> 00:06:52]  secure credit card so if you guys ever get a chance to um to to get to this secure credit
[00:06:52 -> 00:06:57]  card this is one of the best secure credit cards that you that you can get it graduates
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:03]  in about a year right and as you see it's a hard inquiry on your credit report should have
[00:07:03 -> 00:07:09]  a 640 all right so if you're not at a 640 credit score i would not apply for the discover it secure
[00:07:09 -> 00:07:14]  credit card all right and that's the great thing about this pamphlet when do i apply for secure
[00:07:14 -> 00:07:23]  credit cards yes you can get approved before a 640 but more than likely wait until you get to
[00:07:23 -> 00:07:29]  the 640 range before you even apply for the discovery it secure credit card okay um the
[00:07:29 -> 00:07:36]  capital one secure credit card no annual fee refundable deposit 99 to 200 dollars minimum
[00:07:37 -> 00:07:43]  right and capital one secure credit card um kind of does a little bit different instead of giving
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:48]  you your money back for the graduation of the capital one secure credit card what they do is
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:56]  they just increase your limit they call that the graduation period usaa secure platinum
[00:07:56 -> 00:08:04]  secured american express um but let's just go through and and see a little bit of of what else
[00:08:04 -> 00:08:11]  we have here and like i said these are the unsecured credit cards now that we're getting into
[00:08:11 -> 00:08:17]  um this capital one quick silver it pulls from your experience requirement 580 credit score
[00:08:17 -> 00:08:24]  so it doesn't it's one of your lower entry cards the capital one quick silver and it's great to be
[00:08:24 -> 00:08:32]  a part of capital one in itself because they have so many different products they have auto loans
[00:08:32 -> 00:08:39]  they have so many different things that you can do once you become a part of the capital one family
[00:08:39 -> 00:08:44]  and so that's what i like about capital one a lot of you guys burned them i burned them also
[00:08:44 -> 00:08:49]  and that's something that i want you guys to understand that just because you burned a credit
[00:08:49 -> 00:08:56]  card company let me back up when i say burned what i mean is your account went to collections
[00:08:56 -> 00:09:03]  and you didn't pay them back what you can do is apply like two three years if it's like two three
[00:09:03 -> 00:09:08]  years old chances are if you apply again you could get approved i'm not going to say that they are
[00:09:08 -> 00:09:14]  but i did a video where i talked about that where i once had a capital one credit card i included
[00:09:14 -> 00:09:20]  them in my bankruptcy never paid them back but now i do i went and applied for capital one credit
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:26]  card again and i got approved with them so not only do i have the capital one personal i also
[00:09:26 -> 00:09:32]  have the capital one business so those of you that are saying well damn i burned capital one
[00:09:32 -> 00:09:38]  just understand that just because you burned them previously does not mean that you cannot reapply
[00:09:38 -> 00:09:45]  with them and get approved okay so that's the capital one quick silver this is the uh capital
[00:09:45 -> 00:09:51]  one platinum requires a 580 credit score uh pulls from experience credit bureau and like i said you
[00:09:51 -> 00:09:59]  need a 580 fico score um an excellent card for those with no credit history or a low credit score
[00:09:59 -> 00:10:06]  there is no annual fee on the platinum okay if you're following my steps it's not easy to i mean
[00:10:06 -> 00:10:11]  it's not hard to get to a 580 fico score a lot of you think it's hard to get to a 580 maybe you're
[00:10:11 -> 00:10:18]  sitting at a 480 been at a 480 and you're like how do i get to the 580 if you go back and you
[00:10:18 -> 00:10:24]  watch this youtube channel i can i showed you guys how to get to a 580 580 is not hard pretty
[00:10:24 -> 00:10:29]  much that pretty much everybody that's been watching this channel for a year at least a year
[00:10:29 -> 00:10:34]  should be at least a 580 it should be at least a 640 if you've been watching this channel
[00:10:35 -> 00:10:43]  personal uh personal and business credit cards uh delta sky miles uh requires 660
[00:10:43 -> 00:10:49]  uh fico score 5,000 for a 5,000 limit uh let me see
[00:10:51 -> 00:11:00]  annual fee is zero percent there's a blue cash every day it's personal and as you can see we
[00:11:00 -> 00:11:04]  just went through and we tried to put and these these are business credit cards we just tried to
[00:11:04 -> 00:11:11]  compile and and put something in place so that you guys kind of have an idea of what it takes
[00:11:11 -> 00:11:18]  a business platinum card if you're not at a 690 credit score wouldn't apply for this card um and
[00:11:18 -> 00:11:25]  and as you will see that i put a lot of information into this business advantage bank of america
[00:11:25 -> 00:11:33]  needs to be at a 720 fico score right uh pulls from transunion credit bureau
[00:11:33 -> 00:11:37]  must have a 650 which additional info client data
[00:11:41 -> 00:11:48]  okay proof for 9,000 business line 722 fico six inquiries and that's that's something that i've
[00:11:48 -> 00:11:55]  been trying to say that you guys can't have too many inquiries and if you can try and keep your
[00:11:55 -> 00:12:01]  inquiries at least five and below if you're starting to get over five inquiries on your
[00:12:01 -> 00:12:07]  credit report either start disputing them or what you want to do is just give it some time because
[00:12:07 -> 00:12:14]  inquiries only stay on your credit report for uh 24 months so if you have inquiries that are over
[00:12:14 -> 00:12:20]  24 months you definitely want to dispute those inquiries but they should all your inquiries
[00:12:20 -> 00:12:27]  should fall off after 24 months so like i said i put a lot of information into this if you guys
[00:12:27 -> 00:12:36]  want this pdf uh then just go in and chase bank pulls from experience credit bureau scores very
[00:12:36 -> 00:12:44]  differently um requirement 650 or excuse me 750 credit score on a 10,000 limit chase amazon
[00:12:44 -> 00:12:51]  requires a 750 credit score on a seven thousand dollar limit and like i said we just put as much
[00:12:51 -> 00:12:59]  information um that we could we we can um i actually have i think it's this card that i
[00:12:59 -> 00:13:06]  have with chase the chase the ink bold um requires a 720 credit score on a 15,000 limit and that's
[00:13:06 -> 00:13:11]  about right that's about right because that's what that's exactly where my limit is on this
[00:13:11 -> 00:13:18]  chasing card and like i said i don't want to go through all of these but it's it's a long list of
[00:13:18 -> 00:13:26]  stuff like i said there's like close to 50 pages in this pamphlet that my team put together and i
[00:13:26 -> 00:13:32]  hope you guys enjoy it because it took us a little bit of time took us a little bit of money to to
