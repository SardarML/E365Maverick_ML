[00:00:00 -> 00:00:08]  Hey everybody, it's Katie from katiescrochetgoodies.com. Today I am here to talk to you about reading
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:13]  patterns. This is something I have got a lot of requests on, and it's something that I
[00:00:13 -> 00:00:18]  struggled with a lot as I was learning to crochet. So hopefully this video will help
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:23]  you kind of figure out what you need to know and what's most important when you are learning
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:31]  to read patterns. So I just printed one off here that's from my blog. It's a free one
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:41]  I have on my blog for a newborn sock monkey hat. So I'll put the link to this actual pattern
[00:00:41 -> 00:00:46]  in the caption below, so go ahead and check that out when you have a chance. So the first
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:53]  thing to talk about is going to be the pattern layout, and each designer is going to have
[00:00:53 -> 00:00:59]  a different layout, so each pattern essentially from each designer will look differently.
[00:00:59 -> 00:01:06]  But once you get familiar with the important parts of a pattern, you'll be able to look
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:16]  through it and find those pretty easily. So I put the size, I have my copyright up here,
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:25]  I have more sizes of the hat for purchase, and then I have the gauge here that will show
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:30]  it. We'll talk a little bit about that, but this is very, very important, and I'll be
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:39]  doing a video on how to figure that out here shortly. But essentially it's going to tell
[00:01:39 -> 00:01:47]  you if you're crocheting with the same hook and the same yarn that's called for in the
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:55]  pattern, the only difference will be how tightly each person crochets, which can vary drastically.
[00:01:55 -> 00:02:01]  So you want to make sure that you check that before you make the hat, or whatever item
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:08]  it is, because if you don't and then you end up making it, this hat could turn out like
[00:02:08 -> 00:02:16]  an adult size if you have really, really loose stitches and I may crochet way tighter.
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:22]  So that's very, very important that you check that, because I've seen lots of people on
[00:02:22 -> 00:02:27]  the internet talking about, I did this pattern and it's for this size and it turned out this
[00:02:27 -> 00:02:33]  size, and a lot of times that's the problem. Or you're using a different hook size, or
[00:02:33 -> 00:02:42]  a different weight of yarn, or thickness of yarn, which I also have a video on. So
[00:02:42 -> 00:02:50]  another thing is going to be your materials, and then I have finished measurements just
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:56]  so you kind of have an idea to make sure that you're in the ballpark right size once you
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:06]  finish your hat. So we talked about materials, the hook size, and what type of yarn you're
[00:03:06 -> 00:03:13]  using. Another thing is going to be abbreviations. This was probably the hardest thing. When
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:19]  you're reading a pattern, it looks like gibberish until you figure out these, the abbreviations
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:23]  that are used in the pattern. And each pattern will be different, and you need to make sure
[00:03:23 -> 00:03:30]  before you start a pattern that you're familiar with all the stitches or abbreviations, that
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:36]  you know these stitches well, and you've practiced them. And so when you run into DC, you know
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:44]  that means double crochet without having issues or just getting overwhelmed, which will happen
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:50]  at the beginning. It took me a long time to go through a pattern without reading like
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:58]  CH, what is that? Chain. Okay, chain 4, SLST, what does that mean? Oh, slip stitch. So you'll
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:04]  do a lot of that at the beginning, and there is no way around that. You're just going to
[00:04:04 -> 00:04:09]  have to endure it until you kind of get the hang of it, and then after you figure that
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:14]  part out, that was the hardest part for me was getting used to abbreviations because
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:20]  it just looks craziness down here until you figure that out. But once you figure out abbreviations,
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:31]  it's just like reading. So it's really, that's the hardest part I think. Let's see what else.
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:35]  Working in the round is a little bit differently. So when you're making a hat or anything that
[00:04:35 -> 00:04:40]  you're starting in the center, and then working your way out is going to be different than
[00:04:40 -> 00:04:46]  just going through and going back and forth on rows if you're making say a blanket. So
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:52]  you'll have a little bit different how you're starting each row I guess. So working in the
[00:04:52 -> 00:04:59]  round, mine says this pattern is worked in rounds. Each round is joined with a slip stitch
[00:04:59 -> 00:05:08]  into the first stitch from the beginning of that round, not the chain. So at the beginning
[00:05:08 -> 00:05:15]  of each round in this pattern, what I do is I chain 2. Lots of people chain 3 with double
[00:05:15 -> 00:05:20]  crocheting, but I have found that it looks like there's a gap there and you can kind
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:26]  of see a hole. And I just don't like the look of it. It just, for me, my personal taste,
[00:05:26 -> 00:05:33]  I don't want it to stand out. So chaining 2 seems to help with that for me. So at the
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:46]  beginning of each row, I'll be chaining 2 and then I actually do my first stitch into
[00:05:46 -> 00:05:52]  that first stitch that you're in when you chain, if that makes sense. So I chain 2 and
[00:05:52 -> 00:05:56]  then I double crochet right at the bottom of that stitch. And then I go all the way
[00:05:56 -> 00:06:03]  around and then at the end of the row, or the round I guess, I slip stitch to the top
[00:06:03 -> 00:06:12]  of that first stitch that I had made from that round. So another thing to think about
[00:06:12 -> 00:06:20]  is there's going to be different sections. So at the beginning, like how I had the abbreviations,
[00:06:20 -> 00:06:26]  how to read this pattern, you have sizes, gauge, your gouged, your finished measurements,
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:31]  your materials, that stuff usually is always at the beginning and then you'll go into the
[00:06:31 -> 00:06:38]  actual instructions or the actual pattern. And then if there's a, if it's for an item
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:45]  that has multiple pieces, I always break it down within the instructions. I have the instructions
[00:06:45 -> 00:06:50]  for the hat, I have the instructions for the first ear flap, the second ear flap, the
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:57]  mouth, um, what else? The ears, the eyes, the side braids. This one was a little bit
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:03]  hard to explain in words, so I have a picture as well that kind of shows each step that
[00:07:03 -> 00:07:10]  I talk about. And then, yes, pom pom for the top. And same with that, it was kind of really
[00:07:10 -> 00:07:17]  hard to explain. I felt like I needed a visual when I was learning, so I made pictures for
[00:07:17 -> 00:07:23]  those to make it easier. So it's all just going to depend on your designer and how much
[00:07:23 -> 00:07:30]  detail they put into it. A lot of more experienced designers may not say things that seem really
[00:07:30 -> 00:07:38]  like obvious to them, but to a beginner it's like you don't know what to do. Um, one thing
[00:07:39 -> 00:07:48]  that I do want to address is, um, stitch count. So usually, I mean a lot of pattern designers,
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:54]  I guess, at the end of each round or row, they'll put in parentheses how many you should
[00:07:54 -> 00:08:00]  have at that point. And that's just something that makes it easier for people to make sure
[00:08:00 -> 00:08:06]  that they're on the right track. And somehow it's something that I never used when I was
[00:08:06 -> 00:08:14]  following patterns, so I kind of forgot that it even existed. And when I started writing
[00:08:14 -> 00:08:19]  patterns down for myself, I didn't do it. And then when I started writing them up, I
[00:08:19 -> 00:08:25]  never thought about it. And then a couple people have asked me, but, um, it's something
[00:08:25 -> 00:08:29]  I should probably go back and do for all my patterns. It's just going to be extremely
[00:08:29 -> 00:08:35]  time consuming, so I have not carved out any time to do that yet. But it is something that
[00:08:35 -> 00:08:40]  I would like to do in the future. But I do have finished measurement sizes, so you can
[00:08:40 -> 00:08:47]  kind of tell as well. And if you check your gouge, you should be fine. Um, another thing,
[00:08:47 -> 00:08:54]  before you, um, if you're getting really confused on something in a pattern, and you've went
[00:08:54 -> 00:09:01]  through and you've done this a million times, reading it, and then reading up at the abbreviations
[00:09:01 -> 00:09:05]  and coming back, or if something just really doesn't make sense and you think it might
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:12]  be a typo or something, um, then yes, contact the designer. But I would urge you, extremely
[00:09:12 -> 00:09:20]  urge you to read the entire pattern at least once or twice, like literally every word in
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:26]  the pattern before you contact designers, because I've had so many people contact me
[00:09:26 -> 00:09:34]  about things, which is fine, um, but I would just urge you to make sure you read everything.
[00:09:34 -> 00:09:42]  Just because a lot of designers have other jobs as well, like full time jobs. I'm a photographer,
[00:09:42 -> 00:09:48]  and um, I do the blog and the crocheting and crafting, and um, it's a lot to keep up with
[00:09:48 -> 00:09:56]  on top of regular busy life. So a lot of times I'll get a message, and I will admit it does
[00:09:56 -> 00:10:00]  take me a while to weed through all of them, especially if I'm getting a lot at once. It's
[00:10:00 -> 00:10:06]  like an overwhelming task to reply to them all that I don't get to right away. Um, so
[00:10:06 -> 00:10:12]  make sure that you read everything in the pattern, um, before, just in case you miss
[00:10:12 -> 00:10:19]  something, read it twice. Um, but reading patterns is really just going to take practice,
[00:10:19 -> 00:10:23]  just like everything else. You're going to be confused at first. I would suggest starting
[00:10:23 -> 00:10:29]  off with something simple, like this is probably not one that I would suggest for a beginner,
[00:10:29 -> 00:10:38]  because there's so many parts and pieces to it. Um, but, uh, on my website I have, um,
[00:10:38 -> 00:10:49]  oh goodness, I just lost my train of thought. I have a pattern for a flower beanie, so it's
[00:10:49 -> 00:10:56]  very basic, and it has, um, just like a trim around the edges of a different color, and
[00:10:56 -> 00:11:01]  then the rest of the hat is one color, and then obviously for boys you might not want
[00:11:01 -> 00:11:07]  to add a flower, so then it's that much easier. So make sure you check out, um, my website,
[00:11:07 -> 00:11:12]  katiescrochetgoodies.com. I've got lots of free patterns over there, and you can subscribe
[00:11:12 -> 00:11:18]  to my YouTube channel so you can see future videos. I have a whole learning to crochet
[00:11:18 -> 00:11:24]  video series, if that's something that, um, you might have an interest in, feel free to
[00:11:24 -> 00:11:30]  check that out. Um, if you have any questions or concerns or anything that you think I should
[00:11:30 -> 00:11:38]  make a video on, shoot me a message on, um, Facebook, or leave me a comment here. I'm
[00:11:38 -> 00:11:44]  a lot better at checking Facebook, I'll tell you, um, because I'm hoping to make a lot
[00:11:44 -> 00:11:49]  more videos like this one. Thank you, and have a great day.
