[00:00:00 -> 00:00:03]  Good afternoon, everybody!
[00:00:03 -> 00:00:06]  How are you guys doing?
[00:00:06 -> 00:00:08]  Ow!
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:10]  Good.
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:13]  I'm glad that it's good, you know?
[00:00:13 -> 00:00:15]  Everything was fine, then class started, right?
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:17]  You'll think back on the term very...
[00:00:17 -> 00:00:20]  Good afternoon, everybody!
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:23]  How are you guys doing?
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:25]  Ow!
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:27]  Good.
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:31]  I'm glad that it's good, you know?
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:33]  Everything was fine, then class started, right?
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:36]  You'll think back on the term very fondly in those terms.
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:40]  Until I hit her and opened his mouth, everything was good, right?
[00:00:40 -> 00:00:43]  You're supposed to laugh at that.
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:47]  I like you.
[00:00:47 -> 00:00:51]  Did you have a good break?
[00:00:51 -> 00:00:54]  Quiet group.
[00:00:54 -> 00:00:59]  Anybody have anything exciting?
[00:00:59 -> 00:01:01]  Say what?
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:02]  Six flags.
[00:01:02 -> 00:01:09]  I won't say what I thought you said.
[00:01:09 -> 00:01:16]  But I can tell you gave a very vivid image, let me tell you.
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:17]  Six flags.
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:19]  Nobody can top six flags?
[00:01:19 -> 00:01:20]  Stagecoach ride.
[00:01:20 -> 00:01:21]  A stagecoach ride.
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:22]  Where at?
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:23]  Columbia.
[00:01:23 -> 00:01:25]  It's a mining town in California.
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:26]  Oh, cool!
[00:01:26 -> 00:01:27]  It was their birthday.
[00:01:27 -> 00:01:30]  Apparently they've been around for over a hundred years.
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:31]  Sutter's Mill?
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:34]  I think it's a bit more south of there.
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:38]  Yeah.
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:40]  You guys want me to just start talking?
[00:01:40 -> 00:01:41]  Come on, if you don't talk,
[00:01:41 -> 00:01:43]  then I'll just dive into biochemistry.
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:45]  Let's do this.
[00:01:45 -> 00:01:47]  The sooner we get started, the sooner we get it over with?
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:48]  Is that the thinking?
[00:01:48 -> 00:01:49]  Yeah.
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:51]  Take a deep breath, get it over with.
[00:01:51 -> 00:01:52]  I will do that in a minute,
[00:01:52 -> 00:01:55]  but I'd like to get to know you a little bit before I get started.
[00:01:55 -> 00:01:57]  Let me tell you a little bit about myself,
[00:01:57 -> 00:01:59]  and I'll tell you a little bit about the TAs,
[00:01:59 -> 00:02:01]  and then I'd like to learn a little bit about you.
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:03]  My name is Kevin Ahern,
[00:02:03 -> 00:02:06]  and I will be your instructor this term.
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:11]  This is one of my funder classes to teach,
[00:02:11 -> 00:02:13]  and I like having fun when I teach.
[00:02:13 -> 00:02:16]  This is also a more challenging class to teach,
[00:02:16 -> 00:02:19]  and the reason is because, as you're going to discover,
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:22]  we're going to go through a lot of material in this term.
[00:02:23 -> 00:02:25]  You probably have heard that about the class before.
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:26]  It's true.
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:27]  We cover a lot of territory.
[00:02:27 -> 00:02:31]  The good news is that we don't go into it in as much depth
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:33]  as we do in my other classes,
[00:02:33 -> 00:02:37]  but because of that, it means we scan through a lot of material.
[00:02:37 -> 00:02:40]  So we're going to cover all of biochemistry in one term.
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:42]  So I'm not exaggerating when I tell you
[00:02:42 -> 00:02:45]  that my heart goes out to you doing all of biochemistry in one term.
[00:02:45 -> 00:02:47]  That's a lot of stuff.
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:50]  It's also kind of a tough term
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:56]  because the class meets on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.
[00:02:56 -> 00:02:58]  And Friday, let's be honest,
[00:02:58 -> 00:03:01]  nobody wants to come to class on Friday, you know?
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:04]  You think about Friday, and you think it's spring,
[00:03:04 -> 00:03:06]  and it's 70 degrees out there,
[00:03:06 -> 00:03:09]  and who wants to go listen to Ahern talk,
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:12]  especially when he's got that video camera sitting back over there
[00:03:12 -> 00:03:14]  because he videotapes all of his lectures,
[00:03:14 -> 00:03:17]  and, you know, I can just watch the video later,
[00:03:17 -> 00:03:20]  and I really don't need to go to class.
[00:03:20 -> 00:03:24]  And I have that video camera there for a very good purpose,
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:27]  and that purpose is to help you to learn the material,
[00:03:27 -> 00:03:29]  and there's times you can't make it to class.
[00:03:29 -> 00:03:31]  That's why it's there.
[00:03:31 -> 00:03:33]  I've got a couple of students that contacted me earlier
[00:03:33 -> 00:03:36]  and said they were having trouble getting back from spring break
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:38]  in probably some more glamorous place than Six Flags.
[00:03:38 -> 00:03:39]  I don't know where they were at,
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:41]  but they were having trouble getting back,
[00:03:41 -> 00:03:43]  and it doesn't get more glamorous than that.
[00:03:43 -> 00:03:44]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:46]  Yeah, well, maybe they were coming back from Six Legs.
[00:03:46 -> 00:03:48]  I don't know.
[00:03:48 -> 00:03:52]  But it's there for those sorts of situations.
[00:03:52 -> 00:03:56]  I want that camera to be helpful to you and beneficial to you,
[00:03:56 -> 00:03:58]  and the deal I make with the students in the class
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:02]  is that the camera will be there as long as you're here.
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:06]  So when you stop showing up for class,
[00:04:06 -> 00:04:07]  then the camera's going to go away
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:09]  because what the camera's doing then
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:12]  is it's really stopping you from being able to do
[00:04:12 -> 00:04:14]  the things that you need to do.
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:16]  Now, I don't do that to be mean,
[00:04:16 -> 00:04:17]  and I don't do that because my ego says
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:19]  that I have to have a full class,
[00:04:19 -> 00:04:21]  because I really don't believe that.
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:24]  But I do know from experience that students who are in class
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:27]  are those who do better.
[00:04:27 -> 00:04:29]  And you'll see, and I do this data every year.
[00:04:29 -> 00:04:31]  I'll do it again this year.
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:34]  But I give what I call extra credits
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:38]  on days when the class size is small.
[00:04:38 -> 00:04:40]  So if it's a nice day outside,
[00:04:40 -> 00:04:41]  and you're seeing it's really beautiful outside,
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:43]  and I don't want to go listen to Ahern,
[00:04:43 -> 00:04:45]  then that's probably a pretty good chance
[00:04:45 -> 00:04:47]  you're going to see a pop quiz that day,
[00:04:47 -> 00:04:48]  not pop quiz, I shouldn't say a quiz
[00:04:48 -> 00:04:50]  because it's actually extra credit.
[00:04:50 -> 00:04:52]  I'm going to see extra credit on that day
[00:04:52 -> 00:04:54]  because I'm actually surveying
[00:04:54 -> 00:04:57]  what's happening with your grades.
[00:04:57 -> 00:04:59]  And I'll tell you what I've found over the years
[00:04:59 -> 00:05:01]  in doing that little survey.
[00:05:01 -> 00:05:03]  You do get extra credit.
[00:05:03 -> 00:05:06]  So if you come to class and you take that,
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:09]  it's going to boost you compared to if you don't.
[00:05:09 -> 00:05:11]  That's one thing.
[00:05:11 -> 00:05:13]  And the other is when I look at who's coming to class,
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:15]  because that's the only time I take attendance is then,
[00:05:15 -> 00:05:17]  and who's not coming to class,
[00:05:17 -> 00:05:20]  it's remarkable the difference in the grades.
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:23]  It's remarkable the difference in the grades.
[00:05:23 -> 00:05:27]  Two-thirds of the people who are in class
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:31]  are above the average on the days when I give that.
[00:05:31 -> 00:05:33]  And two-thirds of the people who are gone
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:36]  are below the average.
[00:05:37 -> 00:05:39]  Now, coincidence?
[00:05:39 -> 00:05:41]  I would say, well, maybe,
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:44]  but the reality is that I've done it for many years
[00:05:44 -> 00:05:46]  and it's the same year in and year out.
[00:05:46 -> 00:05:48]  It's going to pay you to come to class.
[00:05:48 -> 00:05:51]  So come to class, keep the camera rolling,
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:54]  keep Kevin happy, and we'll all be happy.
[00:05:54 -> 00:05:56]  So I love teaching.
[00:05:56 -> 00:05:58]  I love teaching this class,
[00:05:58 -> 00:06:00]  and I have gotten to know many wonderful students
[00:06:00 -> 00:06:02]  over the years with this class,
[00:06:02 -> 00:06:04]  and I'm sure this term will be the same.
[00:06:04 -> 00:06:06]  I like to interact with you.
[00:06:06 -> 00:06:08]  I really enjoy interacting with you.
[00:06:08 -> 00:06:10]  I really enjoy getting to know you,
[00:06:10 -> 00:06:12]  and I enjoy helping you.
[00:06:12 -> 00:06:14]  And my job is to do that.
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:17]  If you don't come in, I can't help you.
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:20]  And I guess that's that.
[00:06:20 -> 00:06:22]  If you don't come in, I can't help you.
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:24]  So if you come in, you're having difficulty,
[00:06:24 -> 00:06:26]  I can help you, and I'm happy to do that.
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:30]  I've also got two excellent TAs this year
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:32]  who will also be available to meet with you,
[00:06:32 -> 00:06:34]  especially if you think I'm too big and hairy,
[00:06:34 -> 00:06:36]  which of course I'm not.
[00:06:36 -> 00:06:39]  That's supposed to laugh at that.
[00:06:39 -> 00:06:42]  They didn't laugh at that or nothing.
[00:06:42 -> 00:06:44]  These guys haven't heard it at all.
[00:06:44 -> 00:06:46]  These guys have heard it many times.
[00:06:46 -> 00:06:49]  Anyway, let me introduce them to you first.
[00:06:49 -> 00:06:51]  You'll have some interaction with them.
[00:06:51 -> 00:06:53]  On the end is Maria Nguyen.
[00:06:53 -> 00:06:57]  Maria is a senior in biochemistry and biophysics.
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:00]  It's the first time she has been my TA.
[00:07:00 -> 00:07:03]  And sitting next to her is Margot Romilly,
[00:07:03 -> 00:07:06]  who is also a senior in biochemistry and biophysics,
[00:07:06 -> 00:07:08]  and it's the first time she has been my TA.
[00:07:08 -> 00:07:10]  They have heard all my jokes,
[00:07:10 -> 00:07:12]  but they haven't had the joyful experience
[00:07:12 -> 00:07:14]  of having me as the instructor.
[00:07:14 -> 00:07:15]  Right.
[00:07:15 -> 00:07:16]  Okay.
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:18]  So that's a little bit about me.
[00:07:18 -> 00:07:20]  That's a little bit about the course.
[00:07:20 -> 00:07:24]  My philosophy is I really want to help you to learn.
[00:07:24 -> 00:07:26]  Now let's get to know you a little bit,
[00:07:26 -> 00:07:29]  and I will do that with sort of a simple survey first.
[00:07:29 -> 00:07:35]  How many people in here are majoring in nutrition dietetics?
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:36]  Oh yeah.
[00:07:36 -> 00:07:39]  That's not uncommon.
[00:07:39 -> 00:07:40]  Okay.
[00:07:40 -> 00:07:41]  Those were all the F's.
[00:07:41 -> 00:07:42]  Okay.
[00:07:42 -> 00:07:44]  That's a joke.
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:45]  That's a joke.
[00:07:45 -> 00:07:47]  Got off on the wrong foot here, guys.
[00:07:47 -> 00:07:48]  We don't want to do this on the first day.
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:49]  This is really bad.
[00:07:49 -> 00:07:51]  Set the tone for the whole term.
[00:07:51 -> 00:07:54]  How many people in here are in botany plant pathology?
[00:07:54 -> 00:07:55]  One.
[00:07:55 -> 00:07:56]  Okay.
[00:07:57 -> 00:07:59]  Two years ago when I taught this class,
[00:07:59 -> 00:08:01]  there was this group of botany plant pathology,
[00:08:01 -> 00:08:02]  and they all sat in the same place,
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:04]  and I called them the botany mafia.
[00:08:04 -> 00:08:06]  And after I called them that,
[00:08:06 -> 00:08:07]  I had the feeling they really were
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:09]  because they started showing up in strange places.
[00:08:09 -> 00:08:11]  I was worried I was being followed or something.
[00:08:11 -> 00:08:12]  I didn't know.
[00:08:12 -> 00:08:15]  So I hope you're not part of the botany mafia.
[00:08:15 -> 00:08:19]  How many people in some aspect of engineering?
[00:08:19 -> 00:08:20]  Okay.
[00:08:20 -> 00:08:21]  All right.
[00:08:21 -> 00:08:22]  What?
[00:08:22 -> 00:08:23]  What?
[00:08:23 -> 00:08:24]  Chem?
[00:08:24 -> 00:08:25]  Okay.
[00:08:25 -> 00:08:26]  I don't know what it is.
[00:08:26 -> 00:08:28]  BioE, of course, takes BB 450,
[00:08:28 -> 00:08:29]  but I do see some chemes in there.
[00:08:29 -> 00:08:34]  How many people in here are pre-health of some sort?
[00:08:34 -> 00:08:35]  Okay.
[00:08:35 -> 00:08:36]  All right.
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:39]  So pre-pharmacy?
[00:08:39 -> 00:08:40]  No.
[00:08:40 -> 00:08:42]  Pre-dentistry?
[00:08:42 -> 00:08:45]  Pre-medical?
[00:08:45 -> 00:08:48]  This probably isn't the best for pre-medical, I'll tell you.
[00:08:48 -> 00:08:51]  And pre-PT?
[00:08:51 -> 00:08:53]  Pre-PA?
[00:08:53 -> 00:08:54]  Okay.
[00:08:55 -> 00:08:59]  And some other pre, I haven't, pre-optometry?
[00:08:59 -> 00:09:01]  Did I miss a pre?
[00:09:01 -> 00:09:02]  Pre-vet?
[00:09:02 -> 00:09:03]  Pre-vet, oh yeah, pre-vet.
[00:09:03 -> 00:09:04]  Sorry, that's usually a pretty decent number.
[00:09:04 -> 00:09:05]  One?
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:06]  Other pre-vets?
[00:09:06 -> 00:09:07]  One.
[00:09:07 -> 00:09:08]  One, okay, well.
[00:09:08 -> 00:09:10]  You're all by yourself back there.
[00:09:10 -> 00:09:11]  Okay.
[00:09:11 -> 00:09:15]  So how many people are afraid getting started?
[00:09:15 -> 00:09:17]  Be honest, I won't bite you.
[00:09:17 -> 00:09:18]  Okay.
[00:09:18 -> 00:09:20]  How many people have heard horror stories about biochemistry?
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:21]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:21 -> 00:09:22]  Urban legend is out there, right?
[00:09:22 -> 00:09:26]  So I won't ask how many have heard horror stories about me,
[00:09:26 -> 00:09:28]  I don't want to know.
[00:09:28 -> 00:09:31]  That's a joke too, but.
[00:09:31 -> 00:09:36]  Anyway, one of the things that I think is important when you're
[00:09:36 -> 00:09:41]  learning is that I'm a very big believer in the power of
[00:09:41 -> 00:09:43]  positive thinking.
[00:09:43 -> 00:09:46]  I think that the more you convince yourself something is
[00:09:46 -> 00:09:50]  going to be awful, the more likely it is to be awful.
[00:09:51 -> 00:09:54]  Not because it actually is, but because you've got your mindset
[00:09:54 -> 00:09:55]  on that.
[00:09:55 -> 00:09:56]  Okay?
[00:09:56 -> 00:09:58]  It's one of the reasons I find that personal meetings with
[00:09:58 -> 00:10:01]  students really do make a difference, because I think they
[00:10:01 -> 00:10:06]  cut through that awfulness component that students frequently
[00:10:06 -> 00:10:09]  feel or hear about from various things.
[00:10:09 -> 00:10:13]  I'm an advisor in biochemistry and biophysics, and so in my
[00:10:13 -> 00:10:16]  major, you say, oh wow, students are really taking really tough
[00:10:16 -> 00:10:17]  classes and so forth.
[00:10:17 -> 00:10:19]  Well, they have the same fears, they have the same thoughts
[00:10:19 -> 00:10:21]  but they just have them for different classes.
[00:10:21 -> 00:10:24]  And so we have a class that students in our major take called
[00:10:24 -> 00:10:26]  physical chemistry.
[00:10:26 -> 00:10:27]  Okay?
[00:10:27 -> 00:10:29]  And so the legends are out there about physical chemistry,
[00:10:29 -> 00:10:31]  you're going to die doing physical chemistry, it's going to be
[00:10:31 -> 00:10:33]  awful doing physical chemistry, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:10:33 -> 00:10:36]  Physical chemistry is a tough class, no question about it.
[00:10:36 -> 00:10:40]  But a pretty decent percentage of the difficulties people have
[00:10:40 -> 00:10:44]  with the class are actually the anxiety they have with the class.
[00:10:44 -> 00:10:46]  And it has very little to do with the class itself.
[00:10:46 -> 00:10:50]  So I tell my students that you've got to cut through that.
[00:10:50 -> 00:10:51]  Okay?
[00:10:51 -> 00:10:54]  Because the more you're worried about something, the less efficient
[00:10:54 -> 00:10:56]  you are as a learner.
[00:10:56 -> 00:10:57]  Okay?
[00:10:57 -> 00:10:58]  You've got to get through that.
[00:10:58 -> 00:11:01]  So once you cut through that, then I think you have the ability
[00:11:01 -> 00:11:02]  to get on top of things.
[00:11:02 -> 00:11:05]  And I won't tell you that there are perfect instructors on the campus,
[00:11:05 -> 00:11:07]  whether they're in physical chemistry or they're in this class,
[00:11:07 -> 00:11:08]  because there aren't any.
[00:11:08 -> 00:11:09]  Okay?
[00:11:09 -> 00:11:12]  But the best that you can do for yourself is to keep an open mind
[00:11:12 -> 00:11:15]  and to go forward.
[00:11:15 -> 00:11:16]  All right?
[00:11:16 -> 00:11:19]  And if you think positive and you look at things in a positive fashion,
[00:11:19 -> 00:11:24]  you're much more likely to be successful than if you look at it with anxiety.
[00:11:24 -> 00:11:28]  Now that I've totally scared you, should I start?
[00:11:28 -> 00:11:29]  Okay.
[00:11:29 -> 00:11:31]  So today is going to be fairly casual.
[00:11:31 -> 00:11:33]  You're seeing I'm sitting up here talking like this.
[00:11:33 -> 00:11:37]  And I'm going to talk about some very general things about biochemistry.
[00:11:37 -> 00:11:40]  There's not going to be much of what I will talk about today
[00:11:40 -> 00:11:42]  that you're really going to be responsible for.
[00:11:42 -> 00:11:45]  This is one of my rules of thumb for preparation in the class.
[00:11:45 -> 00:11:49]  And one of the rules of thumb is that what I talk about in the class
[00:11:49 -> 00:11:52]  is the most important thing.
[00:11:52 -> 00:11:55]  My guideline in general, with sort of an exception today,
[00:11:55 -> 00:11:59]  but my guideline in general is if I talk about it in class, it's fair game.
[00:11:59 -> 00:12:01]  All right?
[00:12:01 -> 00:12:02]  You say, oh, wow.
[00:12:02 -> 00:12:04]  He can do a lot of talking.
[00:12:04 -> 00:12:05]  All right?
[00:12:05 -> 00:12:09]  Well, A, I'm not going to go pick nitpicky things to ask you about,
[00:12:09 -> 00:12:12]  because that doesn't really prove anything.
[00:12:12 -> 00:12:15]  I try to keep things as general as I can in the questions that I ask.
[00:12:15 -> 00:12:17]  There will be some specifics, to be sure.
[00:12:17 -> 00:12:19]  But I try to keep things as general as I can
[00:12:19 -> 00:12:21]  to try to hit the major points that I talk about.
[00:12:21 -> 00:12:23]  That's very important.
[00:12:23 -> 00:12:26]  Second, I can assure you, and there's a book for the course.
[00:12:26 -> 00:12:27]  It's a free book for the course.
[00:12:27 -> 00:12:29]  How many people have gotten the book for the course?
[00:12:29 -> 00:12:30]  Okay?
[00:12:30 -> 00:12:31]  Get it.
[00:12:31 -> 00:12:32]  It's a free book.
[00:12:32 -> 00:12:33]  It's a free download.
[00:12:33 -> 00:12:35]  It doesn't cost you a dime.
[00:12:35 -> 00:12:38]  I can assure you there will be nothing that,
[00:12:38 -> 00:12:41]  if I don't talk about it, that I will ask you about.
[00:12:41 -> 00:12:42]  That is, if I don't talk about it,
[00:12:42 -> 00:12:44]  I'm not going to ask you a question about it.
[00:12:44 -> 00:12:46]  So the book is there to supplement your knowledge.
[00:12:46 -> 00:12:47]  Okay?
[00:12:47 -> 00:12:49]  So I want you to use that book to help enhance your knowledge,
[00:12:49 -> 00:12:51]  to help learn about things that maybe you're curious about,
[00:12:51 -> 00:12:54]  and to maybe see things explained in a different way
[00:12:54 -> 00:12:56]  than I explained in class, since I wrote the book.
[00:12:56 -> 00:12:58]  It's probably not going to sound much different,
[00:12:58 -> 00:13:00]  but hopefully that will be of benefit to you.
[00:13:00 -> 00:13:01]  Okay?
[00:13:01 -> 00:13:04]  And last, I also, at the end of every class,
[00:13:04 -> 00:13:05]  is I write highlights.
[00:13:05 -> 00:13:10]  And those highlights are my sort of recollection of the,
[00:13:10 -> 00:13:12]  and by the way, my memory is terrible,
[00:13:12 -> 00:13:15]  my recollection of what I saw
[00:13:15 -> 00:13:17]  as the most important things I talked about.
[00:13:17 -> 00:13:19]  Okay?
[00:13:19 -> 00:13:22]  So you can use those as a guide for studying.
[00:13:22 -> 00:13:26]  I'm a big fan, a very big fan, of writing things down.
[00:13:26 -> 00:13:27]  Okay?
[00:13:27 -> 00:13:29]  As a tool for studying, writing things down
[00:13:29 -> 00:13:31]  is one of the best things that you can do.
[00:13:31 -> 00:13:35]  I find highlighting really doesn't teach anybody anything.
[00:13:35 -> 00:13:36]  Okay?
[00:13:36 -> 00:13:38]  So highlighting and color coding,
[00:13:38 -> 00:13:39]  while they look really nice,
[00:13:39 -> 00:13:42]  they aren't necessarily the best ways to study.
[00:13:42 -> 00:13:44]  Study involves writing things down.
[00:13:44 -> 00:13:47]  So if you do that, I think you'll do yourself a great favor.
[00:13:47 -> 00:13:49]  Okay, with respect to the videos,
[00:13:49 -> 00:13:53]  I try to get them posted within 24 hours of having recorded them.
[00:13:53 -> 00:13:55]  It does take a fair amount of rendering,
[00:13:55 -> 00:13:57]  and it does take a fair amount of time.
[00:13:57 -> 00:13:58]  That's one of the reasons I want to see
[00:13:58 -> 00:13:59]  that they're being used properly,
[00:13:59 -> 00:14:02]  and that you guys keep coming to class and so forth,
[00:14:02 -> 00:14:04]  and we'll be fine on the videos.
[00:14:04 -> 00:14:06]  Stop coming to class, you'll lose extra credit,
[00:14:06 -> 00:14:08]  and the videos may stop too.
[00:14:08 -> 00:14:10]  Okay? Is that a deal?
[00:14:10 -> 00:14:12]  All right, let's get started.
[00:14:12 -> 00:14:17]  So what you see on the screen is the class page,
[00:14:17 -> 00:14:22]  and the page has the syllabus on it.
[00:14:22 -> 00:14:24]  The syllabus is required reading.
[00:14:24 -> 00:14:25]  One question on the first exam
[00:14:25 -> 00:14:27]  will come straight from the syllabus.
[00:14:27 -> 00:14:29]  So you need to read the syllabus.
[00:14:29 -> 00:14:32]  It's a requirement that you read the syllabus in the class.
[00:14:32 -> 00:14:33]  The syllabus can be downloaded on here.
[00:14:33 -> 00:14:36]  You can download it right here where it says here.
[00:14:36 -> 00:14:37]  If you haven't downloaded the book,
[00:14:37 -> 00:14:40]  you can download the book right here.
[00:14:40 -> 00:14:42]  That's a long download.
[00:14:42 -> 00:14:44]  Depending on how fast your connection is,
[00:14:44 -> 00:14:47]  it can take a half an hour, so give it time.
[00:14:47 -> 00:14:49]  And as I said in the email I sent to you this weekend,
[00:14:49 -> 00:14:51]  the Chrome browser is the one browser
[00:14:51 -> 00:14:53]  that seems to have some issues with it.
[00:14:53 -> 00:14:54]  So if you're using Chrome,
[00:14:54 -> 00:14:57]  you might want to try a different browser.
[00:14:57 -> 00:14:59]  I will lecture directly from the stuff
[00:14:59 -> 00:15:00]  that you see on the screen.
[00:15:00 -> 00:15:02]  I don't use PowerPoint.
[00:15:02 -> 00:15:04]  I will organize my slides into a PowerPoint,
[00:15:04 -> 00:15:06]  but I don't use PowerPoint
[00:15:06 -> 00:15:08]  because PowerPoint doesn't give me flexibility.
[00:15:08 -> 00:15:10]  PowerPoint is a clunky thing.
[00:15:10 -> 00:15:11]  It's clunky.
[00:15:11 -> 00:15:12]  Click, click, click.
[00:15:12 -> 00:15:13]  Forwards, forwards, forwards.
[00:15:13 -> 00:15:14]  Backwards, backwards, backwards.
[00:15:14 -> 00:15:15]  Forwards, forwards, forwards.
[00:15:15 -> 00:15:16]  You're getting stuck on these things, right?
[00:15:16 -> 00:15:19]  Well, with this thing, I can pretty much look at this
[00:15:19 -> 00:15:21]  and decide where I'm going to go with stuff.
[00:15:21 -> 00:15:22]  And I can adjust accordingly,
[00:15:22 -> 00:15:25]  so I'm not stuck or constrained by PowerPoint.
[00:15:25 -> 00:15:26]  All right.
[00:15:26 -> 00:15:27]  Well, I'd like to start the class off
[00:15:27 -> 00:15:28]  thinking about what I describe
[00:15:28 -> 00:15:30]  as the foundations of biochemistry.
[00:15:30 -> 00:15:36]  Biochemistry is a discipline that is relatively young.
[00:15:36 -> 00:15:39]  The roots of biochemistry go way back
[00:15:39 -> 00:15:42]  into the 1700s or 1800s
[00:15:42 -> 00:15:45]  where people first started thinking about
[00:15:45 -> 00:15:48]  the reason that cells were alive
[00:15:48 -> 00:15:51]  and other things weren't alive.
[00:15:51 -> 00:15:52]  And by the way,
[00:15:52 -> 00:15:54]  anything that you're responsible for today,
[00:15:54 -> 00:15:55]  I will tell you.
[00:15:55 -> 00:15:57]  So I'm just kind of blithering and blathering
[00:15:57 -> 00:15:58]  about things today
[00:15:58 -> 00:16:00]  just to kind of get the mood set.
[00:16:00 -> 00:16:01]  Okay.
[00:16:01 -> 00:16:04]  So when they first started thinking about biochemistry,
[00:16:04 -> 00:16:06]  the term didn't exist, of course,
[00:16:06 -> 00:16:07]  but they were very curious
[00:16:07 -> 00:16:09]  about what separated living systems
[00:16:09 -> 00:16:11]  from other systems.
[00:16:11 -> 00:16:12]  Okay.
[00:16:12 -> 00:16:15]  Why is a cell alive and a rock is not?
[00:16:15 -> 00:16:17]  Okay.
[00:16:17 -> 00:16:20]  And that's a philosophical question at one level,
[00:16:20 -> 00:16:22]  but it's also a very practical
[00:16:22 -> 00:16:25]  and a biochemical question at another level.
[00:16:25 -> 00:16:26]  Okay.
[00:16:26 -> 00:16:30]  Thinking about what was it that made an organism alive
[00:16:30 -> 00:16:32]  is something that probably has permeated
[00:16:32 -> 00:16:34]  all of human history.
[00:16:34 -> 00:16:36]  Okay.
[00:16:36 -> 00:16:37]  We had this notion,
[00:16:37 -> 00:16:38]  or people had a notion for a long time
[00:16:38 -> 00:16:39]  that human beings were something
[00:16:39 -> 00:16:40]  that was very different
[00:16:40 -> 00:16:41]  from the rest of the living world,
[00:16:41 -> 00:16:42]  but one of the things I think,
[00:16:42 -> 00:16:45]  and I hope that you'll learn this term,
[00:16:45 -> 00:16:47]  is that human cells are really no different
[00:16:47 -> 00:16:49]  than anybody else.
[00:16:49 -> 00:16:51]  You're going to be astonished to see
[00:16:51 -> 00:16:55]  how similar in, not necessarily structure,
[00:16:55 -> 00:16:57]  but how similar in organization
[00:16:57 -> 00:16:59]  human cells are to bacterial cells.
[00:16:59 -> 00:17:03]  The simplest bacterium on the face of the earth
[00:17:03 -> 00:17:05]  has much more similarity to your cells
[00:17:05 -> 00:17:07]  than you would ever imagine.
[00:17:07 -> 00:17:09]  Okay.
[00:17:09 -> 00:17:11]  People didn't know that at the time.
[00:17:11 -> 00:17:14]  A bacterium doesn't look anything like a human cell.
[00:17:14 -> 00:17:16]  In fact, back in the beginning of time,
[00:17:16 -> 00:17:19]  people didn't know bacteria existed.
[00:17:19 -> 00:17:21]  Bacteria, as far as anybody was concerned,
[00:17:21 -> 00:17:23]  was a demon.
[00:17:23 -> 00:17:24]  Right?
[00:17:24 -> 00:17:26]  A demon was something that came
[00:17:26 -> 00:17:28]  and something that attacked you.
[00:17:28 -> 00:17:29]  Maybe it was an evil spirit,
[00:17:29 -> 00:17:30]  or maybe it was whatever it was.
[00:17:30 -> 00:17:32]  That was the explanation for what happened
[00:17:32 -> 00:17:34]  when people got sick.
[00:17:34 -> 00:17:35]  Okay.
[00:17:35 -> 00:17:37]  We know the causes of sickness today.
[00:17:37 -> 00:17:38]  We know there are viruses.
[00:17:38 -> 00:17:40]  We know there are bacteria.
[00:17:40 -> 00:17:42]  We know, in some cases, they are genetics.
[00:17:42 -> 00:17:43]  Okay.
[00:17:43 -> 00:17:45]  At that time, they didn't know that.
[00:17:45 -> 00:17:47]  So this quest for understanding what was alive
[00:17:47 -> 00:17:51]  has really been driving biochemistry.
[00:17:51 -> 00:17:53]  Okay.
[00:17:53 -> 00:17:56]  If we fast forward to the 1700s,
[00:17:56 -> 00:17:59]  we get the first glimpses of what I call biochemistry,
[00:17:59 -> 00:18:02]  and this was the invention of the microscope.
[00:18:02 -> 00:18:05]  The microscope told us for the first time
[00:18:05 -> 00:18:11]  that organisms were subdividable.
[00:18:11 -> 00:18:14]  That was that a liver wasn't a thing.
[00:18:14 -> 00:18:18]  A liver was something that was composed of individual cells.
[00:18:18 -> 00:18:21]  It told us that cells were the basic living unit
[00:18:21 -> 00:18:24]  in the universe, at least the universe of the earth.
[00:18:24 -> 00:18:25]  All right?
[00:18:25 -> 00:18:27]  They were the basic living unit.
[00:18:27 -> 00:18:30]  We discovered, because we had microscopes in the 1700s
[00:18:30 -> 00:18:31]  for the first time,
[00:18:31 -> 00:18:36]  that there were what they described as animalcules.
[00:18:36 -> 00:18:37]  Animalcules.
[00:18:37 -> 00:18:38]  I like that name.
[00:18:38 -> 00:18:39]  Right?
[00:18:39 -> 00:18:42]  An animalcule is a combination of an animal and a molecule.
[00:18:42 -> 00:18:43]  Right?
[00:18:43 -> 00:18:45]  So an animalcule is a little tiny animal,
[00:18:45 -> 00:18:47]  and that was their way of describing
[00:18:47 -> 00:18:49]  what we now call as bacteria.
[00:18:49 -> 00:18:50]  Okay?
[00:18:50 -> 00:18:53]  Animalcules, of course, became later known as bacteria,
[00:18:53 -> 00:18:55]  but even in our bodies,
[00:18:55 -> 00:18:58]  we found that we had individual cells, too.
[00:18:58 -> 00:19:00]  And so the question then arose,
[00:19:00 -> 00:19:03]  well, if an organism has individual cells,
[00:19:03 -> 00:19:06]  and an individual cell is the fundamental unit of life,
[00:19:06 -> 00:19:08]  then there must be some fundamental difference
[00:19:08 -> 00:19:12]  between a bacterial cell and a human cell
[00:19:12 -> 00:19:15]  or between a human cell and a dog cell
[00:19:15 -> 00:19:19]  or between a dog cell and a mouse cell.
[00:19:19 -> 00:19:20]  Okay?
[00:19:20 -> 00:19:23]  Well, there are differences between those.
[00:19:23 -> 00:19:26]  There are differences that we can see
[00:19:26 -> 00:19:29]  between a liver cell and a kidney cell
[00:19:29 -> 00:19:31]  in the same organism.
[00:19:31 -> 00:19:33]  DNA-wise, they're not.
[00:19:33 -> 00:19:37]  But the appearance-wise, and for practical purposes,
[00:19:37 -> 00:19:38]  they behave as different kinds of cells.
[00:19:38 -> 00:19:39]  They are different.
[00:19:40 -> 00:19:42]  So something told people that there was
[00:19:42 -> 00:19:45]  something fundamentally different, okay,
[00:19:45 -> 00:19:47]  that made cells be different.
[00:19:47 -> 00:19:48]  What was it?
[00:19:48 -> 00:19:51]  Was it the fact that they were created differently?
[00:19:53 -> 00:19:55]  Was it the fact that there was something else
[00:19:55 -> 00:19:57]  that we didn't know?
[00:19:57 -> 00:19:58]  Okay?
[00:19:58 -> 00:20:00]  Well, by the time we started understanding
[00:20:00 -> 00:20:01]  what cells were,
[00:20:01 -> 00:20:02]  people began to understand
[00:20:02 -> 00:20:05]  what the fundamental units of the universe were as well.
[00:20:05 -> 00:20:08]  We know them, of course, as atoms.
[00:20:08 -> 00:20:09]  Okay?
[00:20:09 -> 00:20:11]  It was clear that there were little invisible things
[00:20:11 -> 00:20:16]  that were there that were the roots of everything.
[00:20:16 -> 00:20:21]  Could it be that atoms were actually at the root of cells?
[00:20:22 -> 00:20:24]  People toss that idea around a lot.
[00:20:24 -> 00:20:27]  And for a long time, people felt that
[00:20:27 -> 00:20:30]  there has to be something different about cells.
[00:20:30 -> 00:20:34]  Maybe atoms exist, maybe molecules exist,
[00:20:34 -> 00:20:36]  and maybe chemistry exists,
[00:20:36 -> 00:20:37]  but whatever exists,
[00:20:37 -> 00:20:41]  it has to be something different inside of a cell
[00:20:41 -> 00:20:43]  because that's magic.
[00:20:43 -> 00:20:47]  As late as the early 1900s,
[00:20:47 -> 00:20:48]  people were saying
[00:20:48 -> 00:20:52]  there's so much complexity inside of a cell,
[00:20:52 -> 00:20:57]  we will never understand what makes an organism be alive.
[00:20:58 -> 00:21:00]  Never say never.
[00:21:01 -> 00:21:02]  Okay?
[00:21:02 -> 00:21:06]  We will never understand what makes an organism be alive.
[00:21:06 -> 00:21:08]  Now, what may come as a bit of a shock to you
[00:21:08 -> 00:21:12]  is it wasn't until about the 1930s
[00:21:14 -> 00:21:16]  that a man, excuse me,
[00:21:16 -> 00:21:18]  that a man named Schrodinger
[00:21:18 -> 00:21:20]  came up with a very radical idea.
[00:21:20 -> 00:21:22]  And his radical idea was that
[00:21:22 -> 00:21:25]  all of the things that we see in biology
[00:21:25 -> 00:21:27]  have their roots in molecules.
[00:21:27 -> 00:21:30]  It was finally, formally accepted.
[00:21:30 -> 00:21:31]  It had previously been shown
[00:21:31 -> 00:21:33]  that the chemistry that was going on
[00:21:33 -> 00:21:34]  inside of living organisms
[00:21:34 -> 00:21:38]  wasn't any different than what was going on outside of a cell.
[00:21:38 -> 00:21:40]  The chemistry was the same.
[00:21:40 -> 00:21:42]  The things that were made inside of a cell
[00:21:42 -> 00:21:44]  could be made in a test tube outside the cell.
[00:21:44 -> 00:21:45]  That wasn't a problem.
[00:21:45 -> 00:21:47]  But for the first time, Schrodinger says
[00:21:47 -> 00:21:50]  there is the root of all living systems.
[00:21:50 -> 00:21:51]  It's not the cell.
[00:21:51 -> 00:21:54]  The root is in the molecules.
[00:21:54 -> 00:21:55]  Okay?
[00:21:55 -> 00:21:57]  That was the very first, what I call,
[00:21:57 -> 00:22:00]  what I call foundation of a discipline we call today
[00:22:00 -> 00:22:01]  molecular biology.
[00:22:01 -> 00:22:02]  You've all heard the term molecular biology.
[00:22:02 -> 00:22:04]  You probably never thought what that meant.
[00:22:04 -> 00:22:05]  Oh, it's molecular biology.
[00:22:05 -> 00:22:08]  It's DNA, it's RNA, it's protein.
[00:22:08 -> 00:22:11]  Yeah, it has all those things.
[00:22:11 -> 00:22:14]  But molecular biology means
[00:22:14 -> 00:22:17]  that at the root of every living system are molecules.
[00:22:17 -> 00:22:21]  And the differences we see between different cells
[00:22:21 -> 00:22:25]  are due to the molecules themselves.
[00:22:25 -> 00:22:26]  Well, that was a great idea.
[00:22:26 -> 00:22:28]  Nobody really knew what that meant.
[00:22:28 -> 00:22:29]  Okay?
[00:22:29 -> 00:22:31]  Until somebody finally sat down and said,
[00:22:31 -> 00:22:34]  well, we know that cells can transmit information
[00:22:34 -> 00:22:36]  from one to the next.
[00:22:36 -> 00:22:40]  Mendel showed with his peas that traits could be inherited.
[00:22:40 -> 00:22:43]  How is it that information could get passed along?
[00:22:43 -> 00:22:45]  So it was a big race to find out
[00:22:45 -> 00:22:47]  how that information could get passed along.
[00:22:47 -> 00:22:48]  You know the results of that race.
[00:22:48 -> 00:22:51]  The race was settled in 1953 when Watson and Crick,
[00:22:51 -> 00:22:54]  using data they stole from Rosalind Franklin,
[00:22:54 -> 00:22:56]  it's a true story, they stole the data,
[00:22:56 -> 00:23:00]  using data they stole from Rosalind Franklin,
[00:23:00 -> 00:23:02]  told them the structure of DNA.
[00:23:02 -> 00:23:03]  DNA was the genetic material.
[00:23:03 -> 00:23:05]  Here was how the information was passed.
[00:23:05 -> 00:23:07]  Case closed.
[00:23:07 -> 00:23:08]  Right?
[00:23:08 -> 00:23:09]  Not quite.
[00:23:09 -> 00:23:11]  Well, the case didn't close because
[00:23:11 -> 00:23:14]  that was really opening doors.
[00:23:14 -> 00:23:15]  All kinds of doors were opened.
[00:23:15 -> 00:23:17]  Wow, here's DNA.
[00:23:17 -> 00:23:20]  Subsequently, RNA was discovered.
[00:23:20 -> 00:23:22]  I shouldn't say discovered, it was known before then,
[00:23:22 -> 00:23:26]  but subsequently the role of RNA became quite clear.
[00:23:26 -> 00:23:30]  The relationship between DNA, RNA, and protein became known.
[00:23:30 -> 00:23:32]  And today we take for granted.
[00:23:32 -> 00:23:35]  I talked to a group of high school students this past week,
[00:23:35 -> 00:23:37]  and I'm sitting there showing them a molecule of DNA.
[00:23:37 -> 00:23:38]  I've got a 3D classroom,
[00:23:38 -> 00:23:39]  and people put on the goggles,
[00:23:39 -> 00:23:41]  they can see everything in 3D.
[00:23:41 -> 00:23:42]  The things are out in the classroom,
[00:23:42 -> 00:23:44]  and they're all going, ooh, wow, wow.
[00:23:44 -> 00:23:45]  And it's really cool.
[00:23:45 -> 00:23:47]  I'll show you guys sometime if you want to see it.
[00:23:47 -> 00:23:48]  And they're looking at this stuff,
[00:23:48 -> 00:23:50]  and I'm sitting there going, you know,
[00:23:50 -> 00:23:52]  everybody knows if I say, you know, DNA,
[00:23:52 -> 00:23:53]  and I say, what goes with T,
[00:23:53 -> 00:23:54]  I know what you're going to tell me.
[00:23:54 -> 00:23:56]  And they all say, A.
[00:23:56 -> 00:23:58]  If I say G, you're going to say C.
[00:23:58 -> 00:24:05]  Every school kid knows now what nobody knew 60 years ago.
[00:24:05 -> 00:24:06]  Remarkable.
[00:24:06 -> 00:24:08]  Well, since then we now know the sequence
[00:24:08 -> 00:24:09]  of all the DNA of the human genome.
[00:24:09 -> 00:24:11]  We know the sequence of organisms, blah, blah, blah.
[00:24:11 -> 00:24:14]  We know so much about what's happening inside of our cells
[00:24:14 -> 00:24:17]  that we can't literally pick up a newspaper today
[00:24:18 -> 00:24:22]  and not see something in there about some new biotech advance,
[00:24:22 -> 00:24:23]  some new medical advance, et cetera.
[00:24:23 -> 00:24:26]  That's happening because of this explosion of knowledge
[00:24:26 -> 00:24:31]  that we've had in molecular biology and biochemistry.
[00:24:31 -> 00:24:33]  So to me, that's what's really exciting.
[00:24:33 -> 00:24:34]  That's what's wonderful.
[00:24:34 -> 00:24:35]  It's a wonderful time to be alive.
[00:24:35 -> 00:24:38]  It's a wonderful time to see the advances.
[00:24:38 -> 00:24:40]  I will tell you how old I am.
[00:24:40 -> 00:24:42]  When I was a graduate student here at Oregon State
[00:24:42 -> 00:24:46]  back in the 1980s, before most of you were born,
[00:24:46 -> 00:24:48]  when I was a graduate student back here
[00:24:48 -> 00:24:50]  in the middle of the 1980s,
[00:24:50 -> 00:24:55]  my thesis advisor wanted to give me a project
[00:24:55 -> 00:24:58]  for my PhD thesis.
[00:24:58 -> 00:25:00]  His project he wanted to give me
[00:25:00 -> 00:25:06]  was he wanted me to isolate and sequence a human gene,
[00:25:06 -> 00:25:09]  the gene that's involved in DNA replication.
[00:25:09 -> 00:25:12]  And he said, I think this would be a good project for you.
[00:25:12 -> 00:25:14]  What do you think?
[00:25:14 -> 00:25:15]  And I said, well, let me think about it.
[00:25:15 -> 00:25:17]  So I went home, and I thought about it,
[00:25:17 -> 00:25:19]  and I looked it over, and I decided,
[00:25:19 -> 00:25:20]  and I came back to him, and I told him,
[00:25:20 -> 00:25:25]  I said, it's too complicated.
[00:25:25 -> 00:25:26]  Too complicated.
[00:25:26 -> 00:25:29]  Today, I could take any person in this room,
[00:25:29 -> 00:25:32]  I could take a high school student,
[00:25:32 -> 00:25:35]  and with the tools that we have available,
[00:25:35 -> 00:25:39]  you could isolate that same gene overnight
[00:25:39 -> 00:25:43]  with no training whatsoever.
[00:25:43 -> 00:25:46]  That tells you that a revolution has happened.
[00:25:46 -> 00:25:49]  A revolution has happened not only in the technology,
[00:25:49 -> 00:25:53]  but in our knowledge and our ability to do things.
[00:25:53 -> 00:25:57]  It also tells you how old I am.
[00:25:57 -> 00:25:59]  That's really remarkable.
[00:25:59 -> 00:26:00]  We take these things for granted,
[00:26:00 -> 00:26:03]  and these advances are happening daily.
[00:26:03 -> 00:26:05]  This is a world that's going by very rapidly,
[00:26:05 -> 00:26:07]  and when we see these things that we pick up
[00:26:07 -> 00:26:09]  and we read in the newspaper about these advances,
[00:26:09 -> 00:26:13]  they're happening because of these advances in technology.
[00:26:13 -> 00:26:14]  So I'm going to spend a little bit of time
[00:26:14 -> 00:26:16]  during the term talking about various techniques,
[00:26:16 -> 00:26:20]  various technologies, not to bore you with techniques,
[00:26:20 -> 00:26:22]  but to show you some of the really remarkable things
[00:26:22 -> 00:26:23]  that we can do.
[00:26:23 -> 00:26:25]  All right, enough of the background here.
[00:26:25 -> 00:26:26]  Now, you notice I didn't say anything in there,
[00:26:26 -> 00:26:29]  but you're responsible for any of that.
[00:26:29 -> 00:26:30]  Even though some of you are writing this down,
[00:26:30 -> 00:26:31]  I think that's good.
[00:26:31 -> 00:26:32]  That's very good.
[00:26:32 -> 00:26:33]  Get in the habit of writing things down.
[00:26:33 -> 00:26:38]  Okay.
[00:26:38 -> 00:26:40]  You've all had organic chemistry.
[00:26:40 -> 00:26:41]  In some case, I know some of you
[00:26:41 -> 00:26:43]  haven't finished your organic chemistry,
[00:26:43 -> 00:26:44]  and I've advised you not to take it
[00:26:44 -> 00:26:46]  if you haven't finished your organic chemistry,
[00:26:46 -> 00:26:48]  but you're here anyway.
[00:26:48 -> 00:26:49]  Fortunately, I don't teach this class
[00:26:49 -> 00:26:52]  as an organic chemistry class.
[00:26:52 -> 00:26:54]  There are some basic things about organic chemistry
[00:26:54 -> 00:26:56]  that I expect everybody will know,
[00:26:56 -> 00:27:01]  and those things, basic names,
[00:27:01 -> 00:27:03]  aldehydes, carboxylic acids,
[00:27:03 -> 00:27:06]  we'll talk about those a lot, ketones, amides,
[00:27:06 -> 00:27:09]  amines, esters, et cetera.
[00:27:09 -> 00:27:10]  So when I talk about those,
[00:27:10 -> 00:27:11]  you should have some understanding
[00:27:11 -> 00:27:13]  about what they are,
[00:27:13 -> 00:27:14]  and I'm not going to go back
[00:27:14 -> 00:27:23]  and review organic chemistry with you.
[00:27:23 -> 00:27:29]  We know, actually I'm not going to go through that.
[00:27:30 -> 00:27:34]  The magic that happens inside of cells.
[00:27:34 -> 00:27:36]  People wanted to have magic.
[00:27:36 -> 00:27:38]  They had magic because they couldn't understand.
[00:27:38 -> 00:27:39]  They didn't have the tools
[00:27:39 -> 00:27:41]  to analyze what was happening inside of cells.
[00:27:41 -> 00:27:42]  And when we don't have the tools
[00:27:42 -> 00:27:43]  to analyze something,
[00:27:43 -> 00:27:44]  and we don't have knowledge,
[00:27:44 -> 00:27:47]  we're very frequently going to call it magic,
[00:27:47 -> 00:27:50]  or we're going to call it demons.
[00:27:50 -> 00:27:51]  Magic for the good stuff,
[00:27:51 -> 00:27:54]  demons for the bad stuff.
[00:27:54 -> 00:27:56]  Well, the magic that happened inside of cells
[00:27:56 -> 00:27:59]  was the fact that cells could duplicate themselves.
[00:27:59 -> 00:28:00]  Cells could reproduce.
[00:28:00 -> 00:28:01]  Cells could take in energy
[00:28:01 -> 00:28:04]  and make great things.
[00:28:04 -> 00:28:05]  Well, the magic that happens inside of cells
[00:28:05 -> 00:28:08]  happens because of macromolecules.
[00:28:08 -> 00:28:09]  Here's something you should know.
[00:28:09 -> 00:28:14]  Macromolecules include things like DNA.
[00:28:14 -> 00:28:17]  DNA is the biggest molecule in your cells
[00:28:17 -> 00:28:19]  by a long ways,
[00:28:19 -> 00:28:21]  and nothing's even close.
[00:28:21 -> 00:28:25]  Nothing is even close to your DNA.
[00:28:25 -> 00:28:26]  I'll give you an example.
[00:28:26 -> 00:28:28]  Your DNA in one cell.
[00:28:28 -> 00:28:29]  How many people know
[00:28:29 -> 00:28:31]  how big one of your cells in your body is?
[00:28:31 -> 00:28:33]  Anybody give me a number.
[00:28:33 -> 00:28:41]  How many meters is one cell of your body?
[00:28:41 -> 00:28:42]  Five nanometers.
[00:28:42 -> 00:28:43]  Five nanometers.
[00:28:43 -> 00:28:44]  Okay, that's too small, too small.
[00:28:44 -> 00:28:45]  Micrometers.
[00:28:45 -> 00:28:47]  Okay, five micrometers is pretty close.
[00:28:47 -> 00:28:48]  Five micrometers is pretty close.
[00:28:48 -> 00:28:51]  About one to five microns.
[00:28:51 -> 00:28:54]  That's one to five millionths of a meter.
[00:28:55 -> 00:28:56]  Smaller than your eye can see,
[00:28:56 -> 00:28:57]  your naked eye can see.
[00:28:57 -> 00:28:58]  You need a microscope to see it.
[00:28:58 -> 00:29:00]  That's why people didn't know we had cells
[00:29:00 -> 00:29:02]  until they had microscopes.
[00:29:02 -> 00:29:06]  But in that cell that's smaller than your eye can see
[00:29:06 -> 00:29:08]  resides, and I'm not making this up,
[00:29:08 -> 00:29:12]  seven feet of DNA.
[00:29:12 -> 00:29:17]  There's seven feet of DNA in every one of your cells.
[00:29:17 -> 00:29:21]  I kid you not.
[00:29:21 -> 00:29:24]  If you took all the DNA of all the cells of your body
[00:29:24 -> 00:29:26]  and you stretched it end to end,
[00:29:26 -> 00:29:29]  you'd go to the sun and back.
[00:29:29 -> 00:29:36]  You've got over 180 million miles of DNA in your body.
[00:29:36 -> 00:29:39]  Now you know why you feel tired this afternoon.
[00:29:39 -> 00:29:41]  You're carrying around 180 million miles of DNA
[00:29:41 -> 00:29:45]  every time you take a step.
[00:29:45 -> 00:29:46]  Right?
[00:29:46 -> 00:29:48]  Okay, so DNA by a long ways
[00:29:48 -> 00:29:51]  is the largest molecule in your body.
[00:29:51 -> 00:29:55]  Related molecule in your body, RNA.
[00:29:55 -> 00:29:58]  RNA structurally is very similar to DNA,
[00:29:58 -> 00:30:02]  but RNA is slightly chemically different,
[00:30:02 -> 00:30:04]  and it's smaller.
[00:30:04 -> 00:30:06]  RNAs are made much smaller.
[00:30:06 -> 00:30:07]  They're made from the DNA,
[00:30:07 -> 00:30:10]  and they're made in little tiny pieces.
[00:30:10 -> 00:30:13]  RNAs are much more abundant.
[00:30:13 -> 00:30:16]  We have thousands, millions of them inside of our cells,
[00:30:16 -> 00:30:22]  but we don't have the length of the RNAs in our cells.
[00:30:22 -> 00:30:23]  Proteins.
[00:30:23 -> 00:30:24]  Proteins are, you're going to hear this
[00:30:24 -> 00:30:25]  over and over and over,
[00:30:25 -> 00:30:26]  especially in the first couple weeks of the course.
[00:30:26 -> 00:30:29]  Proteins are the workhorses of the cell.
[00:30:29 -> 00:30:32]  Proteins catalyze reactions.
[00:30:32 -> 00:30:35]  Those are known as the enzymes.
[00:30:35 -> 00:30:39]  Proteins communicate information.
[00:30:39 -> 00:30:45]  They're used in a process we call signaling.
[00:30:46 -> 00:30:47]  By the way, whenever I go too fast,
[00:30:47 -> 00:30:48]  just raise your hand and say,
[00:30:48 -> 00:30:50]  Hey, Kevin, slow down.
[00:30:50 -> 00:30:53]  Okay?
[00:30:53 -> 00:30:54]  I won't stop pacing, though.
[00:30:54 -> 00:30:55]  I always pace.
[00:30:55 -> 00:30:56]  If you really want to see something funny,
[00:30:56 -> 00:30:59]  all you have to do is watch the video at fast speed,
[00:30:59 -> 00:31:00]  and you'll see me going,
[00:31:00 -> 00:31:02]  ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.
[00:31:02 -> 00:31:03]  Okay?
[00:31:03 -> 00:31:06]  Nervous habits are hard to break, right?
[00:31:06 -> 00:31:11]  Okay, so proteins, they catalyze the reactions.
[00:31:11 -> 00:31:13]  They do signaling.
[00:31:13 -> 00:31:16]  They let cells talk to each other.
[00:31:16 -> 00:31:20]  They give structural integrity.
[00:31:20 -> 00:31:23]  They give cells some structure.
[00:31:23 -> 00:31:27]  And in some cases, they give organismal integrity.
[00:31:27 -> 00:31:33]  Your fingernails, your hair, those are proteins.
[00:31:33 -> 00:31:37]  And the last macromolecule that we'll be concerned with
[00:31:37 -> 00:31:41]  is the polysaccharides.
[00:31:41 -> 00:31:42]  These come in a variety of forms,
[00:31:42 -> 00:31:44]  and they're used for a variety of purposes.
[00:31:44 -> 00:31:49]  We use polysaccharides in our body primarily to store energy,
[00:31:49 -> 00:31:52]  and most organisms have some sort of energy storage
[00:31:52 -> 00:31:57]  they do with polysaccharides.
[00:31:57 -> 00:31:58]  But others, like plants,
[00:31:58 -> 00:32:00]  for the botany plant pathology people in here,
[00:32:00 -> 00:32:02]  plants use polysaccharides
[00:32:02 -> 00:32:04]  for structural integrity of their cells.
[00:32:04 -> 00:32:07]  They actually make up the cell walls.
[00:32:07 -> 00:32:10]  Okay.
[00:32:10 -> 00:32:18]  Now, the building blocks of the macromolecules,
[00:32:18 -> 00:32:19]  and we're going to talk more about these later,
[00:32:19 -> 00:32:21]  but I'll just mention them now.
[00:32:21 -> 00:32:26]  For proteins, the building blocks are amino acids.
[00:32:26 -> 00:32:28]  Amino acids.
[00:32:28 -> 00:32:34]  There are 20 amino acids that occur in all organisms,
[00:32:34 -> 00:32:40]  because 20 amino acids are used to make all proteins.
[00:32:40 -> 00:32:43]  There are a few rare amino acids
[00:32:43 -> 00:32:46]  that are occasionally used to make proteins in addition,
[00:32:46 -> 00:32:50]  but they're extraordinarily rare.
[00:32:50 -> 00:32:51]  For all practical purposes,
[00:32:51 -> 00:32:55]  there are 20 amino acids that make up proteins.
[00:32:55 -> 00:32:58]  The building blocks for nucleic acids,
[00:32:58 -> 00:33:00]  and by the way, nucleic acids is a term
[00:33:00 -> 00:33:03]  that includes both DNA and RNA.
[00:33:03 -> 00:33:07]  The building blocks of nucleic acids are the nucleotides.
[00:33:07 -> 00:33:09]  Now, you think of them as A, G, C, T,
[00:33:09 -> 00:33:12]  but that's only a part of the nucleotide, as we will see.
[00:33:12 -> 00:33:14]  The A is only a part of the nucleotide,
[00:33:14 -> 00:33:16]  but we won't worry about that today.
[00:33:16 -> 00:33:18]  And the building blocks of the polysaccharides,
[00:33:18 -> 00:33:21]  of course, are the sugars.
[00:33:21 -> 00:33:24]  Alright.
[00:33:24 -> 00:33:27]  DNA has this great property of being able to replicate itself.
[00:33:27 -> 00:33:30]  I don't need to tell you this, you already know this.
[00:33:30 -> 00:33:31]  Wherever there's a G,
[00:33:31 -> 00:33:33]  it can be replaced on the other strand by a C.
[00:33:33 -> 00:33:35]  Wherever there's a T, another strand by an A.
[00:33:35 -> 00:33:39]  It's RNA as we have here, U and A instead of A and T, etc.
[00:33:39 -> 00:33:42]  But, the point is that there's information
[00:33:42 -> 00:33:46]  contained in a strand of DNA or RNA,
[00:33:46 -> 00:33:50]  and that information can be used to make additional copies.
[00:33:50 -> 00:33:56]  And that's a very, very valuable and important trait.
[00:33:56 -> 00:33:59]  I kind of like this structure, self-replicating molecules.
[00:33:59 -> 00:34:03]  We think that life on Earth evolved originally from molecules
[00:34:03 -> 00:34:07]  that started to replicate themselves.
[00:34:07 -> 00:34:09]  Started to replicate themselves.
[00:34:09 -> 00:34:11]  We know in very simple chemistry
[00:34:11 -> 00:34:16]  that it's possible to start making macromolecules.
[00:34:16 -> 00:34:18]  We know in the conditions of primordial Earth
[00:34:18 -> 00:34:22]  that those macromolecules can connect with each other
[00:34:22 -> 00:34:25]  and those macromolecules under certain conditions
[00:34:25 -> 00:34:27]  can start to copy themselves.
[00:34:27 -> 00:34:34]  And we think that was actually the origins of life on Earth.
[00:34:34 -> 00:34:39]  Now, here's your biology lesson for the day.
[00:34:39 -> 00:34:40]  Everybody's frowning.
[00:34:40 -> 00:34:46]  I've never seen such a frowning class.
[00:34:46 -> 00:34:48]  Why are you frowning?
[00:34:48 -> 00:34:49]  Nobody wants to look at me.
[00:34:49 -> 00:34:51]  Once I say that, nobody wants to look at me.
[00:34:51 -> 00:34:56]  Everybody starts smiling.
[00:34:56 -> 00:35:00]  Are you guys going to be my frowniest class ever, or what?
[00:35:00 -> 00:35:02]  Maybe we're just focusing.
[00:35:02 -> 00:35:03]  You're just focusing.
[00:35:03 -> 00:35:05]  Do you frown when you're really learning things?
[00:35:05 -> 00:35:06]  Maybe?
[00:35:06 -> 00:35:07]  Well, that's good.
[00:35:07 -> 00:35:08]  So if frowning means that you're learning,
[00:35:08 -> 00:35:10]  then I'm all in favor of frowning.
[00:35:10 -> 00:35:13]  But usually it means I can't stand your guts.
[00:35:13 -> 00:35:14]  Okay, I don't know.
[00:35:14 -> 00:35:18]  So maybe I should tell you a joke.
[00:35:18 -> 00:35:19]  You want a joke?
[00:35:19 -> 00:35:20]  Sure.
[00:35:20 -> 00:35:22]  If I tell you a joke, will you promise to laugh?
[00:35:22 -> 00:35:23]  Yes.
[00:35:23 -> 00:35:24]  You promise?
[00:35:24 -> 00:35:25]  Yeah.
[00:35:25 -> 00:35:27]  Okay, all right.
[00:35:27 -> 00:35:29]  You have to laugh, too.
[00:35:29 -> 00:35:32]  So this is one of my favorite jokes of all time.
[00:35:32 -> 00:35:34]  All of my jokes are one of my favorite jokes of all time.
[00:35:34 -> 00:35:37]  But this is, right now, one of my favorite jokes of all time.
[00:35:37 -> 00:35:39]  So this joke, all right.
[00:35:39 -> 00:35:42]  So there's this little guy named Artie that wants to be a hitman.
[00:35:42 -> 00:35:44]  If you heard this joke, please don't give it away.
[00:35:44 -> 00:35:45]  He wants to be a hitman.
[00:35:45 -> 00:35:46]  He wants to go kill people for a living,
[00:35:46 -> 00:35:47]  and she's rolling her eyes.
[00:35:47 -> 00:35:49]  You've heard this joke, haven't you?
[00:35:49 -> 00:35:51]  Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:51 -> 00:35:52]  He wants to be a hitman, right?
[00:35:52 -> 00:35:55]  So he goes out, and he puts up signs around the neighborhood.
[00:35:55 -> 00:35:58]  It says, you know, willing to kill somebody for cheap, right?
[00:35:58 -> 00:36:00]  So you want to get started, you've got to do it for cheap.
[00:36:00 -> 00:36:03]  You give away your services, people get your reputation out there,
[00:36:03 -> 00:36:05]  next thing you know, people start paying you a lot of money
[00:36:05 -> 00:36:07]  to do what you want to do, right?
[00:36:07 -> 00:36:09]  So Artie goes out there, and he puts up the signs,
[00:36:09 -> 00:36:12]  and it says, you know, will kill somebody for cheap.
[00:36:12 -> 00:36:14]  Puts his phone number down there, you know,
[00:36:14 -> 00:36:16]  and he's sitting around the house, and the phone rings,
[00:36:16 -> 00:36:18]  and says, hey, are you Artie?
[00:36:18 -> 00:36:19]  And he goes, yeah.
[00:36:19 -> 00:36:21]  Well, that's how I get somebody I want you to kill.
[00:36:21 -> 00:36:22]  Good, good, good.
[00:36:22 -> 00:36:24]  He says, I want you to kill my wife.
[00:36:24 -> 00:36:25]  Oh, okay, yeah, that's fine.
[00:36:25 -> 00:36:28]  He says, how much are you going to charge?
[00:36:28 -> 00:36:29]  He said, well, I said I'd do it for cheap.
[00:36:29 -> 00:36:32]  He said, how's a dollar?
[00:36:32 -> 00:36:34]  And he said, that sounds good to me.
[00:36:34 -> 00:36:37]  He says, can you kill her right now?
[00:36:37 -> 00:36:39]  He said, well, yeah, sure, I'll put my pants on, you know,
[00:36:39 -> 00:36:41]  go get dressed and go out.
[00:36:41 -> 00:36:42]  Where's she at?
[00:36:42 -> 00:36:44]  He says, well, she's down at the grocery store.
[00:36:44 -> 00:36:45]  So he gives her the direction of the grocery store,
[00:36:45 -> 00:36:48]  gives Artie a description of what she looks like and everything,
[00:36:48 -> 00:36:50]  and so he goes down there.
[00:36:50 -> 00:36:52]  And he looks around the grocery store for somebody
[00:36:52 -> 00:36:54]  meeting this description, and he looks, and all of a sudden,
[00:36:54 -> 00:36:56]  oh, there she is.
[00:36:56 -> 00:36:57]  She's over there, right?
[00:36:57 -> 00:37:00]  So he goes tip, tip, tip, tip-toeing, you know,
[00:37:00 -> 00:37:02]  and he gets up there, and he sneaks up,
[00:37:02 -> 00:37:04]  and he grabs her from behind, and he chokes her to death
[00:37:04 -> 00:37:08]  right there in the grocery store, okay?
[00:37:08 -> 00:37:13]  Strangles her right there in the grocery store, okay?
[00:37:13 -> 00:37:14]  He's feeling pretty good, and he's turning around
[00:37:14 -> 00:37:16]  and trying to get away, and he looks around,
[00:37:16 -> 00:37:19]  and nobody saw him, right?
[00:37:19 -> 00:37:21]  Well, they can't have a witness, because he's not going to,
[00:37:21 -> 00:37:23]  you know, be a hitman for very long with a witness.
[00:37:23 -> 00:37:24]  So he goes over and he grabs the witness,
[00:37:24 -> 00:37:26]  and he grabs and he strangles them right there
[00:37:26 -> 00:37:28]  in the grocery store as well.
[00:37:28 -> 00:37:29]  He's feeling okay.
[00:37:29 -> 00:37:31]  Now he makes his getaway, and ah, da, da, da,
[00:37:31 -> 00:37:32]  there's somebody over here, right?
[00:37:32 -> 00:37:34]  Just my lucky day, right?
[00:37:34 -> 00:37:35]  Every time I turn around, there's somebody
[00:37:35 -> 00:37:36]  that's seen me kill somebody, right?
[00:37:36 -> 00:37:38]  So he goes over and he strangles this person.
[00:37:38 -> 00:37:40]  He goes running out.
[00:37:40 -> 00:37:42]  He thinks he's made his great escape,
[00:37:42 -> 00:37:44]  but the police catch him, sadly,
[00:37:44 -> 00:37:46]  and the headlines in the newspaper the next day read,
[00:37:46 -> 00:37:49]  Artie chokes three for a dollar at the grocery store.
[00:37:49 -> 00:37:55]  Audience laughs.
[00:37:55 -> 00:37:57]  I can tell by the groans that not everybody
[00:37:57 -> 00:38:00]  had heard that joke before.
[00:38:00 -> 00:38:02]  Artie, you see, was, okay.
[00:38:08 -> 00:38:09]  Now if you go tell all your friends next year
[00:38:09 -> 00:38:10]  when I go tell that joke,
[00:38:10 -> 00:38:12]  everybody will have heard it, right?
[00:38:12 -> 00:38:14]  Don't tell next year's class that joke.
[00:38:14 -> 00:38:15]  That'll be good.
[00:38:15 -> 00:38:17]  Okay.
[00:38:17 -> 00:38:18]  Here's your biology lesson.
[00:38:18 -> 00:38:19]  I have to tell you a joke
[00:38:19 -> 00:38:22]  before I tell you your biology lesson.
[00:38:22 -> 00:38:26]  How many people like freshman biology?
[00:38:26 -> 00:38:27]  Okay, two people.
[00:38:27 -> 00:38:30]  Well, I won't ask how many didn't like freshman biology,
[00:38:30 -> 00:38:31]  but I have a feeling I know.
[00:38:31 -> 00:38:36]  Okay, freshman biology, cell biology.
[00:38:36 -> 00:38:38]  So the reason I bring this up
[00:38:38 -> 00:38:40]  is I will talk this term a fair amount
[00:38:41 -> 00:38:43]  about different cell types.
[00:38:43 -> 00:38:46]  So there are really three major divisions of cell types
[00:38:46 -> 00:38:47]  on the face of the Earth.
[00:38:47 -> 00:38:50]  Prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells,
[00:38:50 -> 00:38:51]  and what are called the Archeans.
[00:38:51 -> 00:38:54]  The Archeans are a very odd group of cells.
[00:38:54 -> 00:38:56]  We're learning a lot more about them
[00:38:56 -> 00:38:59]  since they've been discovered relatively recently,
[00:38:59 -> 00:39:02]  maybe in the last 30 years or so.
[00:39:02 -> 00:39:05]  But we're not going to say much about the Archeans.
[00:39:05 -> 00:39:08]  We will focus an awful lot on the most common types of cells
[00:39:08 -> 00:39:11]  which are the bacteria, known as the prokaryotes.
[00:39:11 -> 00:39:15]  That's P-R-O-K-A-R-Y-O-T-E-S.
[00:39:15 -> 00:39:19]  And the eukaryotes, which include things like animals,
[00:39:19 -> 00:39:24]  cats, dogs, plants, fungi.
[00:39:24 -> 00:39:30]  So multicellular organisms will always be eukaryotic.
[00:39:30 -> 00:39:33]  Multicellular organisms will always be eukaryotic.
[00:39:33 -> 00:39:36]  Yes, you need to know this.
[00:39:36 -> 00:39:42]  There are some unicellular eukaryotic organisms.
[00:39:42 -> 00:39:44]  They include yeast,
[00:39:44 -> 00:39:47]  stuff you make bread and beer with.
[00:39:47 -> 00:39:52]  Yeast are unicellular eukaryotic organisms.
[00:39:52 -> 00:39:56]  But there are no multicellular prokaryotic organisms.
[00:39:56 -> 00:39:59]  All the prokaryotic organisms are unicellular.
[00:39:59 -> 00:40:04]  We call them bacteria most commonly.
[00:40:04 -> 00:40:07]  Now there are differences in these organisms
[00:40:07 -> 00:40:10]  from a visible point of view.
[00:40:10 -> 00:40:13]  Bacteria, first of all, are considerably smaller
[00:40:13 -> 00:40:15]  than eukaryotic cells.
[00:40:15 -> 00:40:21]  Prokaryotic cells are smaller.
[00:40:21 -> 00:40:24]  Prokaryotic cells are much simpler in appearance.
[00:40:24 -> 00:40:29]  Prokaryotic cells, for example, don't have a nucleus.
[00:40:29 -> 00:40:30]  They don't have organelles.
[00:40:30 -> 00:40:32]  They don't have mitochondria.
[00:40:33 -> 00:40:36]  They don't have endoplasmic reticulum.
[00:40:36 -> 00:40:38]  They're basically what people describe
[00:40:38 -> 00:40:41]  as a bag of enzymes and DNA.
[00:40:41 -> 00:40:42]  And that's what they are.
[00:40:42 -> 00:40:46]  There's no division of things into separate regions
[00:40:46 -> 00:40:49]  like there is in eukaryotic cells.
[00:40:49 -> 00:40:51]  In eukaryotic cells we see organization.
[00:40:51 -> 00:40:57]  We see a nucleus where the DNA and the RNA are found.
[00:40:57 -> 00:41:01]  We see a mitochondrion where the energy is made.
[00:41:02 -> 00:41:06]  We see lysosomes that are involved in breaking things down.
[00:41:06 -> 00:41:08]  We see the endoplasmic reticulum
[00:41:08 -> 00:41:11]  which is involved in trafficking and modifying proteins.
[00:41:15 -> 00:41:17]  So fundamental differences in the cell types
[00:41:17 -> 00:41:19]  and we'll say more about those.
[00:41:19 -> 00:41:21]  Now despite those fundamental differences
[00:41:21 -> 00:41:25]  what we're going to see is that down at the molecular level
[00:41:25 -> 00:41:28]  there's not much difference.
[00:41:28 -> 00:41:30]  There's really not very much difference
[00:41:30 -> 00:41:33]  between bacteria and between cells of eukaryotes.
[00:41:38 -> 00:41:39]  I like that picture.
[00:41:39 -> 00:41:40]  Kind of cool.
[00:41:40 -> 00:41:43]  E. coli, the most abundant organism in your gut.
[00:41:43 -> 00:41:44]  How many people in here
[00:41:44 -> 00:41:46]  have ever worked with E. coli in the laboratory?
[00:41:46 -> 00:41:48]  What does it smell like?
[00:41:48 -> 00:41:50]  S-H-I-T.
[00:41:50 -> 00:41:54]  That's what gives your doo-doo the smell.
[00:41:54 -> 00:41:57]  They're very commonly used in laboratories
[00:41:57 -> 00:41:58]  not to punish students
[00:41:58 -> 00:42:01]  but rather because they're extraordinarily studied.
[00:42:01 -> 00:42:02]  Extremophiles.
[00:42:02 -> 00:42:05]  These include some bizarre things
[00:42:05 -> 00:42:08]  that come from bizarre regions of Earth.
[00:42:08 -> 00:42:10]  They're commonly Archean organisms.
[00:42:10 -> 00:42:13]  Not always, but they're commonly Archean organisms.
[00:42:13 -> 00:42:15]  This is something from a,
[00:42:15 -> 00:42:18]  I think it's a sulfur pit in Yellowstone Park.
[00:42:23 -> 00:42:25]  And the eukaryotic cells, we get to them.
[00:42:26 -> 00:42:28]  Here's a representation now
[00:42:28 -> 00:42:31]  of some of the structures that we see inside of there.
[00:42:31 -> 00:42:33]  So we've got the nucleus,
[00:42:33 -> 00:42:35]  and I'm not going to go back and ask you to label
[00:42:35 -> 00:42:36]  and do all this sort of stuff.
[00:42:36 -> 00:42:38]  I think you should know some general things
[00:42:38 -> 00:42:41]  about the organelles like I have mentioned to you.
[00:42:41 -> 00:42:43]  Just very general things about the organelles.
[00:42:47 -> 00:42:49]  One of the things students and men find surprising
[00:42:49 -> 00:42:53]  is the fact that cells, just like our body,
[00:42:53 -> 00:42:55]  also have a skeleton.
[00:42:55 -> 00:42:57]  We call it a cytoskeleton,
[00:42:57 -> 00:42:59]  and you can see it depicted.
[00:42:59 -> 00:43:00]  It's been stained here.
[00:43:00 -> 00:43:03]  Very cool for you to see, nice and clear.
[00:43:03 -> 00:43:06]  That cytoskeleton gives cells some structure,
[00:43:06 -> 00:43:08]  and it's something that has to be manipulated
[00:43:08 -> 00:43:11]  very continuously by cells
[00:43:11 -> 00:43:14]  to perform the things that they do.
[00:43:14 -> 00:43:16]  Okay, let's see.
[00:43:16 -> 00:43:17]  Energy.
[00:43:17 -> 00:43:19]  One of the things we're going to talk about this term a lot
[00:43:19 -> 00:43:21]  is energy.
[00:43:21 -> 00:43:25]  Because energy is necessary for living organisms.
[00:43:25 -> 00:43:26]  We're going to see why.
[00:43:26 -> 00:43:27]  I'll tell you why briefly.
[00:43:27 -> 00:43:28]  We're going to see why later
[00:43:28 -> 00:43:30]  when we talk more about the Gibbs free energy.
[00:43:32 -> 00:43:35]  Energy is necessary to organize.
[00:43:36 -> 00:43:38]  Energy is necessary to organize.
[00:43:38 -> 00:43:40]  How many people know what entropy is?
[00:43:42 -> 00:43:43]  Everybody knows what entropy is.
[00:43:43 -> 00:43:44]  Describe entropy to me.
[00:43:44 -> 00:43:45]  What's entropy?
[00:43:45 -> 00:43:48]  Things continually fall apart or break down.
[00:43:48 -> 00:43:50]  Yeah, chaos.
[00:43:51 -> 00:43:53]  Things will tend to move to disorder
[00:43:53 -> 00:43:56]  instead of moving towards order, right?
[00:43:57 -> 00:44:00]  There are people who mistakenly think that
[00:44:00 -> 00:44:02]  because things move towards disorder,
[00:44:02 -> 00:44:04]  or at least we think they move towards disorder,
[00:44:04 -> 00:44:05]  that that's got to be wrong
[00:44:05 -> 00:44:08]  because we look at cells, they're very ordered.
[00:44:08 -> 00:44:10]  And if things went towards disorder,
[00:44:10 -> 00:44:12]  how in the world can we be ordered?
[00:44:12 -> 00:44:15]  How can we have such order in the things that we do
[00:44:15 -> 00:44:19]  if the universal tendency is towards disorder?
[00:44:20 -> 00:44:22]  Well, the answer is,
[00:44:22 -> 00:44:25]  the analogy I like to give is the deck of cards.
[00:44:25 -> 00:44:28]  The deck of cards, you take, you throw up in the air.
[00:44:29 -> 00:44:31]  You pick up all the cards.
[00:44:31 -> 00:44:32]  Most likely they're not organized,
[00:44:32 -> 00:44:35]  ace, king, queen, jack, blah, blah, blah.
[00:44:35 -> 00:44:37]  They're going to be in sort of a random order, right?
[00:44:38 -> 00:44:41]  If you sit down and you spend some time playing solitaire
[00:44:41 -> 00:44:44]  and you organize those cards,
[00:44:44 -> 00:44:46]  they then end up being ace, king, queen, jack,
[00:44:46 -> 00:44:48]  ten, nine, eight, blah, blah, blah, right?
[00:44:49 -> 00:44:50]  How did that happen?
[00:44:50 -> 00:44:52]  Well, it happened because you put energy into it.
[00:44:53 -> 00:44:56]  Putting energy into things enables order to be possible.
[00:44:57 -> 00:45:01]  Putting energy into the universe
[00:45:01 -> 00:45:04]  allows your cells to organize themselves
[00:45:04 -> 00:45:08]  and fight that constant battle of entropy.
[00:45:08 -> 00:45:11]  Cells are fighting that battle constantly.
[00:45:12 -> 00:45:15]  If they have no energy, they lose the battle.
[00:45:16 -> 00:45:20]  Without energy, you lose the battle against entropy.
[00:45:21 -> 00:45:23]  Cells cannot be chaotic.
[00:45:23 -> 00:45:28]  Cells cannot live in a totally jumbled world.
[00:45:28 -> 00:45:29]  They have to be able to maintain some control.
[00:45:29 -> 00:45:31]  That control happens because of energy.
[00:45:32 -> 00:45:34]  The energy that happens in our cells is stored
[00:45:34 -> 00:45:37]  in a couple of different important forms.
[00:45:37 -> 00:45:41]  The immediate form energy is stored in our cells is ATP.
[00:45:41 -> 00:45:42]  Everybody knows that.
[00:45:42 -> 00:45:44]  ATP is the gasoline of cells.
[00:45:46 -> 00:45:47]  Adenosine triphosphate.
[00:45:48 -> 00:45:49]  Why is it stored there?
[00:45:49 -> 00:45:52]  Well, it turns out that when you put phosphates
[00:45:52 -> 00:45:55]  chemically joined next to each other,
[00:45:55 -> 00:45:59]  they really don't like to be chemically joined next to each other.
[00:46:00 -> 00:46:02]  Phosphates are negatively charged.
[00:46:03 -> 00:46:04]  Put three phosphates,
[00:46:04 -> 00:46:06]  one phosphate, another phosphate,
[00:46:06 -> 00:46:08]  another phosphate next to each other,
[00:46:08 -> 00:46:10]  you've got three things that want to repel each other
[00:46:10 -> 00:46:12]  and they're chemically tied together.
[00:46:15 -> 00:46:16]  They're chemically tied together.
[00:46:16 -> 00:46:20]  When you allow them to fly apart, they do.
[00:46:22 -> 00:46:23]  Like a bat out of hell.
[00:46:24 -> 00:46:25]  They release energy.
[00:46:25 -> 00:46:28]  When you break the bond, the energy is released,
[00:46:28 -> 00:46:30]  the phosphate goes flying away,
[00:46:31 -> 00:46:33]  and that energy can be used to do something.
[00:46:34 -> 00:46:39]  So ATP is our most immediate source of energy.
[00:46:40 -> 00:46:44]  We store energy with a variety of molecules.
[00:46:44 -> 00:46:46]  We store it in the form of fat.
[00:46:47 -> 00:46:49]  We store it in the form of carbohydrates.
[00:46:50 -> 00:46:52]  We even store it in the form of proteins,
[00:46:52 -> 00:46:54]  although that's not used primarily
[00:46:54 -> 00:46:57]  as an energy source in our cells, that is.
[00:47:00 -> 00:47:01]  From a nutrition point of view,
[00:47:01 -> 00:47:04]  proteins are a very important source of energy
[00:47:04 -> 00:47:05]  for those of you who are in nutrition,
[00:47:05 -> 00:47:06]  for those of you who are in nutrition,
[00:47:06 -> 00:47:09]  because, not because our cells are using it
[00:47:09 -> 00:47:11]  as an energy source, but because we're eating it
[00:47:11 -> 00:47:14]  and using the energy of some other cell
[00:47:14 -> 00:47:15]  to power things for us.
[00:47:15 -> 00:47:18]  We think about things like Atkins diet, for example.
[00:47:19 -> 00:47:24]  Atkins diet is a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet
[00:47:24 -> 00:47:26]  and if that energy were not in the proteins,
[00:47:26 -> 00:47:28]  people on Atkins diet would lose weight
[00:47:28 -> 00:47:29]  even faster than they do.
[00:47:29 -> 00:47:31]  They still lose weight reasonably fast.
[00:47:32 -> 00:47:33]  But for our cells,
[00:47:34 -> 00:47:37]  phosphates linked together in the form of ATP
[00:47:37 -> 00:47:38]  are an immediate source of energy
[00:47:38 -> 00:47:41]  and used universally throughout our cells.
[00:47:44 -> 00:47:46]  The last thing I'll finish with here today,
[00:47:48 -> 00:47:49]  that's just a silly example.
[00:47:49 -> 00:47:51]  The last thing I'll finish is actually
[00:47:51 -> 00:47:53]  describing something to you.
[00:47:53 -> 00:47:54]  I like this example, though,
[00:47:54 -> 00:47:57]  because this example tells us that
[00:47:57 -> 00:48:00]  energy can be stored in some pretty amazing ways
[00:48:00 -> 00:48:01]  and do some pretty amazing things.
[00:48:01 -> 00:48:03]  Electric eels can electrocute.
[00:48:03 -> 00:48:04]  They can kill you
[00:48:04 -> 00:48:07]  with the electric voltage that they build up.
[00:48:08 -> 00:48:10]  So we think of energy in terms of heat.
[00:48:10 -> 00:48:13]  We think of energy in terms of mechanical things.
[00:48:13 -> 00:48:15]  We don't always think of biological energy
[00:48:15 -> 00:48:16]  in terms of electrical.
[00:48:16 -> 00:48:17]  But as we will see,
[00:48:17 -> 00:48:20]  biological energy is, in fact, electrical as well.
[00:48:21 -> 00:48:23]  We talk about nerve transmission, for example.
[00:48:23 -> 00:48:26]  We're going to see there's an electrical component to that.
[00:48:26 -> 00:48:28]  Very important to understand.
[00:48:28 -> 00:48:29]  What I wanted to finish with,
[00:48:29 -> 00:48:30]  I thought I had a slide,
[00:48:30 -> 00:48:31]  but I guess I didn't put that in there,
[00:48:31 -> 00:48:34]  was a description of potential energy
[00:48:34 -> 00:48:36]  versus kinetic energy.
[00:48:37 -> 00:48:39]  Potential versus kinetic energy.
[00:48:40 -> 00:48:41]  You guys have seen the example.
[00:48:41 -> 00:48:42]  You've got the ball up the hill.
[00:48:42 -> 00:48:43]  The ball rolls up the hill.
[00:48:43 -> 00:48:44]  Balls don't roll up hills.
[00:48:44 -> 00:48:46]  You have to roll balls uphill, by the way.
[00:48:47 -> 00:48:49]  There's this thing called gravity.
[00:48:51 -> 00:48:54]  The ball up the hill has potential energy.
[00:48:54 -> 00:48:56]  You have to put energy in there to get it up there.
[00:48:57 -> 00:49:01]  You have to put energy into a molecule to make ATP.
[00:49:03 -> 00:49:04]  ATP is potential energy.
[00:49:05 -> 00:49:06]  It can be used for something.
[00:49:08 -> 00:49:10]  The ball rolls down the hill, kinetic energy.
[00:49:10 -> 00:49:11]  We see the energy being released
[00:49:11 -> 00:49:12]  and the fact that it's moving down the hill,
[00:49:12 -> 00:49:14]  gravity's pulling it down.
[00:49:16 -> 00:49:18]  The loss of that energy in the form of ATP
[00:49:18 -> 00:49:22]  is the phosphate being cleaved and that phosphate flying away.
[00:49:22 -> 00:49:23]  Exactly the same sort of thing,
[00:49:23 -> 00:49:25]  just at a molecular level instead of a macroscopic level.
[00:49:27 -> 00:49:30]  With that said, I think I will stop for today
[00:49:30 -> 00:49:31]  and I will see you tomorrow.
