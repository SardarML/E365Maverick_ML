[00:00:00 -> 00:00:07]  I mentioned in a previous video that I've been watching a lot of these Hispanic crafters
[00:00:07 -> 00:00:15]  working their magic with some newspapers and magazines and white glue, basically.
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:20]  There's this one gal, I swear to you, she could probably build a house out of newspapers
[00:00:20 -> 00:00:21]  and Elmers.
[00:00:21 -> 00:00:22]  I just know it.
[00:00:22 -> 00:00:23]  She does amazing things.
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:32]  Anyway, I've been really inspired by them and have been rolling paper tubes like a crazy
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:33]  woman.
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:37]  I just thought that the paper beads were addictive.
[00:00:37 -> 00:00:38]  The tubes are worse.
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:40]  At least they are for me.
[00:00:40 -> 00:00:45]  And it may be because they're a little bit easier for me to do.
[00:00:45 -> 00:00:49]  They're still not pleasant to do if you have hand issues.
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:51]  You know, they're kind of like paper beads.
[00:00:51 -> 00:00:56]  Your hands are probably going to cramp up and complain, but they're not as difficult,
[00:00:56 -> 00:01:02]  I don't think anyway, because they're not as small.
[00:01:02 -> 00:01:07]  You don't have to hold on to such a small thing.
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:12]  So I started watching these videos, needed to make some tubes.
[00:01:12 -> 00:01:17]  I had made some before several years ago and they're still up in my art room.
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:21]  I never did use them for anything because I wasn't really inspired.
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:24]  But I discovered that I made them wrong.
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:28]  Not wrong, but in a not very efficient way.
[00:01:28 -> 00:01:31]  There's a better way.
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:36]  And what I learned is you need a strip of paper.
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:39]  Don't use the whole magazine page.
[00:01:39 -> 00:01:47]  Cut it into sections and that makes your tube easier to fold and roll.
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:54]  If you use the whole sheet, then the middle part of your paper tube gets really thick
[00:01:54 -> 00:01:57]  because it's got a lot of layers rolled up in there.
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:04]  And when it's really thick, and if you're wanting to coil it into a little spiral like
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:10]  this, you're going to have trouble because it's hard to do with thin paper, but thick
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:12]  paper, really hard.
[00:02:12 -> 00:02:15]  So what you do is you cut it into pieces.
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:20]  For like a standard magazine page, you would just open the magazine, maybe cut it in half
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:21]  down the middle.
[00:02:21 -> 00:02:22]  That's all you need.
[00:02:22 -> 00:02:26]  I've been doing about four inch wide strips.
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:31]  This was an old textbook of Taylor's that she couldn't resell.
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:36]  It was a, I think it was Art History.
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:40]  And it was one of those that, you know, some textbooks you just can't sell back.
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:44]  So we were going to, it was in a Goodwill box and I went and fished it out because it
[00:02:44 -> 00:02:48]  had some pretty colors on some of the pages.
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:52]  So I cut the entire book up like that and then I pulled a couple other books out too.
[00:02:52 -> 00:02:59]  She's got, she has this Environmental Science, which has some color in it and the weight
[00:02:59 -> 00:03:01]  of the paper is good.
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:05]  Not too heavy, but it's got a glossy finish and I like that.
[00:03:05 -> 00:03:14]  And then I also found a Sociology and this one has some good color in it, as well as
[00:03:14 -> 00:03:22]  this even thinner paper, not quite as glossy, but it just has a nice finish on it.
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:25]  So old textbooks.
[00:03:25 -> 00:03:26]  There you go.
[00:03:26 -> 00:03:34]  And boy, you can find old textbooks for next to nothing at thrift stores.
[00:03:34 -> 00:03:37]  They're always there, if you happen to need them.
[00:03:37 -> 00:03:43]  But of course you can use whatever magazines come into your house or newspapers as well.
[00:03:43 -> 00:03:48]  I don't care as much for the newspapers, I'll tell you why in a minute, but the magazines
[00:03:48 -> 00:03:49]  are great.
[00:03:49 -> 00:03:55]  So all you do is cut your page down into about a four inch strip.
[00:03:55 -> 00:04:00]  Doesn't have to be perfect, doesn't have to be straight, doesn't have to be exact.
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:06]  The only thing it does have to be is as smooth as you can get it on the edges.
[00:04:06 -> 00:04:09]  And some of these will have to be kind of trimmed up a little.
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:15]  I found this out when I started doing some newspapers and I thought, okay, cutting these
[00:04:15 -> 00:04:22]  is going to be really tedious, I'll just lay a straight edge down and rip them into sections,
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:24]  you know, four inch wide strips.
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:27]  Which that's what you usually do for paper mache, it works out fine.
[00:04:27 -> 00:04:37]  Not so much for this, because you do sometimes get a little, see the edge gets a little bit
[00:04:37 -> 00:04:44]  like that, or a little jagged where it gets torn, and that doesn't work because when you
[00:04:44 -> 00:04:48]  roll it, those little jagged edges stick out.
[00:04:48 -> 00:04:53]  So the whole tearing didn't work, but I did find that it wasn't a big deal to just, you
[00:04:53 -> 00:05:00]  know, fold the page up like this and cut it and make the strips that way, because it
[00:05:00 -> 00:05:02]  doesn't have to be perfect.
[00:05:02 -> 00:05:09]  So you take your magazine page or your newspaper page, and by the way, the Sunday paper with
[00:05:09 -> 00:05:16]  all of the sales ads and the big colorful grocery ads, oh those are great, because there's
[00:05:16 -> 00:05:17]  so much color in them.
[00:05:17 -> 00:05:22]  So you know, Sunday, perfect.
[00:05:22 -> 00:05:29]  This is one of the textbook pages, you need a skewer, this is one of the bigger skewers,
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:34]  and I don't know where I got it, seems like I've seen them at the craft stores, I might
[00:05:34 -> 00:05:41]  have even gone to the grocery store, but it's one of the, you know, kind of heavy duty ones,
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:46]  I don't know what size it is, but it's kind of the larger skewer, slightly smaller than
[00:05:46 -> 00:05:49]  a drinking straw, put it that way.
[00:05:49 -> 00:05:57]  You take this, you lay it on the corner, one corner of your strip of paper, you don't
[00:05:57 -> 00:06:04]  need an exact, what do you call that, like a right angle down at the bottom, you want
[00:06:04 -> 00:06:05]  it like this.
[00:06:05 -> 00:06:08]  Oh, I should have looked up my geometry.
[00:06:08 -> 00:06:11]  What is that, like a, that's a right triangle, right?
[00:06:11 -> 00:06:17]  And that's an isosceles, I forget, okay, look at me spouting stuff off like I know what
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:19]  I'm talking about.
[00:06:19 -> 00:06:28]  Fold it in, start rolling, and you just want to make sure that it stays snug as you roll.
[00:06:28 -> 00:06:36]  Rolling, pick it up, and then the kind of glue I use depends on the paper, I probably
[00:06:36 -> 00:06:38]  should have got some different glue.
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:46]  I'll use like a thicker tacky glue on some of this thick paper, but you just need, even
[00:06:46 -> 00:06:50]  Elmer's would work on the newspapers and thinner papers.
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:55]  Pull your skewer out, and there's your tube.
[00:06:55 -> 00:07:02]  You know, takes practically no time at all, there is a learning curve, so you'll probably
[00:07:02 -> 00:07:08]  do at least two dozen before you get into the group, that's about what it took me.
[00:07:08 -> 00:07:14]  And when you finish, you may notice that one end of your tube is a little bit bigger around
[00:07:14 -> 00:07:16]  than the other.
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:22]  Usually this end down here that you started with will stay nice and tight, but the one
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:26]  at the end, where you end up, is a little bit bigger.
[00:07:26 -> 00:07:27]  You want that.
[00:07:27 -> 00:07:33]  Of course, you don't want it to be huge, you don't want a huge difference, but if you look
[00:07:33 -> 00:07:41]  at it and you go, okay, I can tell, this is slightly bigger than this one, glue, that's
[00:07:41 -> 00:07:46]  okay, because you're actually going to need that, but that's all you do.
[00:07:46 -> 00:07:51]  And then you'll want to make about a million of these, because that's what it will take
[00:07:51 -> 00:07:54]  to really do anything with them.
[00:07:54 -> 00:07:59]  So after you've done about a million, then you can actually make something, but I really
[00:07:59 -> 00:08:00]  do find this soothing.
[00:08:00 -> 00:08:06]  Let me show you the newspaper ones.
[00:08:06 -> 00:08:11]  I found that the actual newspaper pages, like this is an actual newsprint newspaper
[00:08:11 -> 00:08:17]  page, I don't care for these as much, they're a little bit harder to roll up for me, it's
[00:08:17 -> 00:08:24]  hard to keep it tight, and plus they turn my hands black.
[00:08:24 -> 00:08:31]  And I usually just hold, I'm just kind of gently holding it together with my left fingers
[00:08:31 -> 00:08:40]  like this, just to keep it from spreading out and getting too wide, but you just have
[00:08:40 -> 00:08:46]  to maintain a constant tension, and don't let go.
[00:08:46 -> 00:08:51]  This is another reason why the longer newspaper strips irritate me.
[00:08:51 -> 00:08:55]  Okay, again.
[00:08:55 -> 00:09:00]  And you'll figure out whichever way works best for you, sometimes keeping it laying
[00:09:00 -> 00:09:09]  on the table is best, other times it's better if you pick it up and do this.
[00:09:09 -> 00:09:15]  You just have to figure out which way you like, and whatever you do, don't let go.
[00:09:15 -> 00:09:31]  A little glue, put it in, pull your skewer out, and there you have it.
[00:09:31 -> 00:09:37]  I don't know if you can tell, this end is a little bit wider than this end, not like
[00:09:37 -> 00:09:42]  you know, freakishly so, but a little bit wider, and that's okay, because that will
[00:09:42 -> 00:09:45]  be useful when you start coiling.
[00:09:45 -> 00:09:48]  So there you have it.
[00:09:48 -> 00:10:04]  Now, after you've made a billion, like so, these are mostly some of the glossy ads from
[00:10:04 -> 00:10:06]  the Sunday paper.
[00:10:06 -> 00:10:11]  Then you can start coiling them, or you know, you can just lay them out like this and make
[00:10:11 -> 00:10:12]  stuff out of them.
[00:10:12 -> 00:10:17]  I've seen some wall art and some clocks and some boxes covered with them, you know, that
[00:10:17 -> 00:10:23]  kind of thing, which is great, I love all that stuff.
[00:10:23 -> 00:10:31]  One thing you can make that's very easy is a bowl, and you start by making a coil like
[00:10:31 -> 00:10:36]  this, and I may do like a demo video for one of these, but this won't be it.
[00:10:36 -> 00:10:43]  This one is a base, it's already glued together, it doesn't move, but you just start coiling,
[00:10:43 -> 00:10:52]  and if you're going to coil the strips like this, or you're going to make a bowl, it's
[00:10:52 -> 00:10:54]  easier if you flatten them first.
[00:10:54 -> 00:11:00]  This didn't occur to me until like just, I think it was yesterday, and I saw a, it was
[00:11:00 -> 00:11:06]  a blog post, or maybe an Etsy shop, of a woman who sells stuff made out of magazine
[00:11:06 -> 00:11:11]  pages, but they're like several hundred dollars for each one of the things that she sells,
[00:11:11 -> 00:11:14]  because they're awesome.
[00:11:14 -> 00:11:18]  And she talks about the process, and you know why they cost so much is because it's just
[00:11:18 -> 00:11:23]  so time consuming to roll all the papers and then flatten them, and she said that, and
[00:11:23 -> 00:11:28]  then flatten them, and I was like, oh, she flattens them?
[00:11:28 -> 00:11:32]  Because I had just been, you know, taking the, where's the one I just did?
[00:11:32 -> 00:11:38]  I had just been taking the thing, you know, start here, like that, a little dab of glue,
[00:11:38 -> 00:11:44]  and then just roll, you know, just like that, and just flatten it myself as I went along.
[00:11:44 -> 00:11:45]  That's what I was doing.
[00:11:45 -> 00:11:51]  It didn't occur to me to flatten them out first, and then coil them.
[00:11:51 -> 00:11:57]  And you'll see, there's some bowls and paper stuff made out of magazine pages that have
[00:11:57 -> 00:12:02]  been folded instead of coiled, and that's an option, too.
[00:12:02 -> 00:12:06]  I just don't like the folding thing, but I don't, that's not soothing to me, this is
[00:12:06 -> 00:12:12]  soothing to me, folding is just irritating, I don't know why, but it is in that context
[00:12:12 -> 00:12:13]  anyway.
[00:12:13 -> 00:12:18]  But, she said flatten, and I went, oh, and she didn't say how she flattened them or what
[00:12:18 -> 00:12:24]  she used to flatten them, but I found that a pasta machine works nicely, and I've got
[00:12:24 -> 00:12:31]  one of those silver crank tabletop pasta machines that has never seen a drop of pasta in its
[00:12:31 -> 00:12:37]  entire life, it is for craft purposes only, and I used to run a lot of polymer clay through
[00:12:37 -> 00:12:42]  it, but it is perfect for just running these little dudes through there, flattens them
[00:12:42 -> 00:12:49]  right out, makes them much easier to coil, and the coils are much neater.
[00:12:49 -> 00:12:53]  So there's you an option for that.
[00:12:53 -> 00:12:57]  If you don't have a pasta machine, you could probably use, if you have a die-cut machine
[00:12:57 -> 00:13:00]  with one of those long plates on it, that would probably work, too.
[00:13:00 -> 00:13:03]  Just anything to squish them.
[00:13:03 -> 00:13:13]  And then you can coil them and make them into something like this bowl that I made.
[00:13:13 -> 00:13:20]  And it is nothing but coil, I think that this one was part of the art history book, and
[00:13:20 -> 00:13:27]  it's the coiled tubes, and the reason that you need one end to be bigger than the other,
[00:13:27 -> 00:13:31]  while you're coiling, and you want to, you know, you get one tube coiled and you're ready
[00:13:31 -> 00:13:38]  to add the next, you want to be able to slip one end into the other.
[00:13:38 -> 00:13:44]  And if you have one end that's always a little bit bigger than the other, it's much easier
[00:13:44 -> 00:13:46]  to get them to fit together.
[00:13:46 -> 00:13:54]  So that's why that one end bigger is actually a good thing.
[00:13:54 -> 00:14:01]  So, and I'll put the video, the link for the video that I watched the Hispanic woman doing
[00:14:01 -> 00:14:05]  this with, because she just does it really well.
[00:14:05 -> 00:14:10]  And just kind of made the bowl, really winged it, looked at some videos, but kind of made
[00:14:10 -> 00:14:16]  it up as I went, did the whole base like this, which, you know, is really easy, you just
[00:14:16 -> 00:14:21]  keep adding coils until it gets to the size you want, and then just started, instead of
[00:14:21 -> 00:14:26]  leaving them flat, just used a little glue to build them up as I went.
[00:14:26 -> 00:14:32]  So, and there's a couple different ways to do that, I'm going to try another way too.
[00:14:32 -> 00:14:44]  And when it was done, I used some markers, just some of these Faber-Castell markers,
[00:14:44 -> 00:14:51]  and just kind of scribbled on it, really, that's all I did, random scribbles.
[00:14:51 -> 00:14:57]  And with the color and print that was already on there, and combined with the marker, which
[00:14:57 -> 00:15:01]  is really kind of transparent, it just came out looking really cool.
[00:15:01 -> 00:15:02]  So I like it.
[00:15:02 -> 00:15:08]  And all I used to seal it when it was done is, I have a little container of watered-down
[00:15:08 -> 00:15:11]  Elmers, and that's what I used.
[00:15:11 -> 00:15:16]  Now that it's finished with the color and everything, I will put a final, a better sealer
[00:15:16 -> 00:15:21]  on it, like a varnish or something, or Mod Podge would be fine, you know, I mean, you're
[00:15:21 -> 00:15:27]  not trying to get it dishwasher-safe or anything, just sealed enough to use.
[00:15:27 -> 00:15:38]  So these are fun to do, and if you want to kick it up a notch, bam, bam!
[00:15:38 -> 00:15:42]  There's these.
[00:15:42 -> 00:15:48]  This is a basket that I made, and this was another, this was a, oh my gosh, I've got
[00:15:48 -> 00:15:51]  a million paper beads, what am I going to do?
[00:15:51 -> 00:15:56]  So I came up with this little thing, to put a bead in the middle of each little coiled
[00:15:56 -> 00:15:58]  thingy.
[00:15:58 -> 00:16:03]  And this whole thing is made out of Taylor's old art history book.
[00:16:03 -> 00:16:12]  And I was inspired to make this by this basket that I have, this most awesome basket that
[00:16:12 -> 00:16:17]  I have and that I love, and ooh, I don't know if you can see it without me spilling it,
[00:16:17 -> 00:16:20]  it is made out of bottle caps.
[00:16:20 -> 00:16:26]  And I did not make it, I bought it, and I think I bought it at Barnes & Noble.
[00:16:26 -> 00:16:31]  They had a bunch of stuff like this at one time that was made, it's like made in Africa
[00:16:31 -> 00:16:39]  or something, and it was some kind of special, you know, imported, maybe fundraising, crafty
[00:16:39 -> 00:16:40]  things that they had.
[00:16:40 -> 00:16:46]  And I just loved it, because it's, it's so, because some of these I've not really even
[00:16:46 -> 00:16:52]  heard of before, and you know, others are relatively mainstream, but it's just so rustic
[00:16:52 -> 00:16:56]  and cool, and I love it, this is just one of my favorite things.
[00:16:56 -> 00:17:03]  And I've collected some water bottle caps in it, and if you happen to know why I'm collecting
[00:17:03 -> 00:17:07]  these water bottle caps, could you just leave that in the comments?
[00:17:07 -> 00:17:13]  That would be really great, because I'm not sure, I am quite sure that I need to collect
[00:17:13 -> 00:17:20]  them, but now that my little bucket's full, I have stopped, but I really should do something
[00:17:20 -> 00:17:28]  with them, or at least get some ideas, and there is a rather large box in my garage full
[00:17:28 -> 00:17:37]  of these that I got from a, um, yeah, volunteering at a color run, and I, you know, we gave out
[00:17:37 -> 00:17:41]  like 4,000 bottles of water, and I kept every cap!
[00:17:41 -> 00:17:48]  So, I have a lot of plastic water bottle caps, and one day I'm going to be really glad that
[00:17:48 -> 00:17:53]  I have them, but that day is not today, so if you could just tell me why I have them
[00:17:53 -> 00:17:56]  and make me glad, that would be so great.
[00:17:56 -> 00:18:02]  So that was kind of the design inspiration for this, because I love that bottle cap basket
[00:18:02 -> 00:18:09]  so much, I just sort of mimicked the design here with these little spirals, and these
[00:18:09 -> 00:18:16]  were three tubes, book page tubes together, and then I tied them together, this is some
[00:18:16 -> 00:18:29]  hemp cord stuff, and I still haven't trimmed it off, and the bottom is a cereal box, Cocoa
[00:18:29 -> 00:18:36]  Puffs, no, no, no, no, not Cocoa Puffs, Golden Grams, it's a piece of a Golden Gram cereal
[00:18:36 -> 00:18:45]  box that I just put some of the tubes on for the bottom, and I used a combination of just
[00:18:45 -> 00:18:50]  some techie, that techie glue type stuff, and then there's some hot glue in here too,
[00:18:50 -> 00:18:55]  Jason drilled all of the little holes for the beads so that I could run the hemp up
[00:18:55 -> 00:19:02]  through there, and then I had intended to put handles on it like the other one, but
[00:19:02 -> 00:19:06]  when I got to that point, I was so darn sick of looking at it, I just wanted to call it
[00:19:06 -> 00:19:12]  done, so I just stuck these beads on top, which I wasn't really crazy about, and I'm
[00:19:12 -> 00:19:18]  still not just loving it, but it's ok, because it's kind of funky and weird and different,
[00:19:18 -> 00:19:24]  and I like it, I mean ideally it would have been great to put paper beads on here, but
[00:19:24 -> 00:19:32]  making a round paper bead is a beast, it's a beast that I don't like, so I wasn't going
[00:19:32 -> 00:19:38]  to do that, but this, I thought this was a really good use for the whole bunch of paper
[00:19:38 -> 00:19:44]  beads, and I really love the way it turned out, and I thought that I might sell these
[00:19:44 -> 00:19:49]  on Etsy, and I still might, I'm not sure, but they're going to cost about four million
[00:19:49 -> 00:19:56]  dollars each, because that's how much trouble they are to make, and I'm sure the second
[00:19:56 -> 00:20:02]  one will be much easier, now that I know what I'm doing, and I know what not to do, but
[00:20:02 -> 00:20:11]  yeah, this was a trip, so there's that, and that's what this base is right here, I'm working
[00:20:11 -> 00:20:18]  on another one, but I want it to, I'm working on a round, kind of a large bowl, with some
[00:20:18 -> 00:20:26]  of these open thingies, and I will probably use some more paper beads in there too, so
[00:20:26 -> 00:20:38]  there you go, ideas for upcycling some newspapers, magazines, and textbooks, and for using all
[00:20:38 -> 00:20:45]  of the paper beads that I'm sure you have, and for filling up all of your spare time,
[00:20:45 -> 00:20:52]  because I know you have tons of it, so, oh, I did, I forgot to show this, which I'll show
[00:20:52 -> 00:20:59]  you right quick, and you know, I'll point you to the video, because like I said, I learned
[00:20:59 -> 00:21:05]  from somebody else, and don't really have anything to add, and I may do a bowl tutorial
[00:21:05 -> 00:21:09]  video at some point, but this is not that point, but I did want to show you, to get
[00:21:09 -> 00:21:18]  the open coil like this, is just use a something, I had this little lotion bottle, and it was
[00:21:18 -> 00:21:26]  about the size that I wanted, so that's what I used to coil the things around, like that,
[00:21:26 -> 00:21:31]  and that made the open section, and just depending on how big of a container you use, you can
[00:21:31 -> 00:21:36]  make some with smaller ones, or bigger openings in them, so that's how you get that, that
[00:21:36 -> 00:21:50]  look. So, um, okay, until I think of something else urgent to talk to you about, that's it.
[00:21:50 -> 00:21:56]  So, let's just be extra awkward and say, the end.
