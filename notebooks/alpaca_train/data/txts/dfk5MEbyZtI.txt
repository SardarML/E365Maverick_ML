[00:00:00 -> 00:00:16]  Hi, this is Tom from xerodefinals.com. In this video, I'm going to be going through
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:22]  diverticular disease and you can find written notes on this topic at xerodefinals.com slash
[00:00:22 -> 00:00:30]  diverticulosis or in the general surgery section of the xerodefinals surgery book.
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:40]  So let's jump straight in. A diverticulum or plural diverticular is a pouch or pocket
[00:00:40 -> 00:00:49]  in the bowel wall usually ranging in size from 0.5 to 1 cm. Diverticulosis refers to
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:57]  the presence of diverticular without inflammation or infection. Diverticulosis may be referred
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:08]  to as diverticular disease when patients experience symptoms. Diverticulitis refers to inflammation
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:18]  and infection of diverticular. Let's talk about the pathophysiology. The wall of the
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:25]  large intestine contains a layer of muscle called the circular muscle. The points along
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:33]  the bowel where this muscle layer is penetrated by blood vessels are areas of weakness. Increased
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:38]  pressure in the lumen over time can cause a gap to form in these areas of the circular
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:47]  muscle. These gaps allow the mucosa to herniate through the muscle layer and pouches to form
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:57]  which we call diverticular. Diverticular do not form in the rectum because it has an
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:02]  outer longitudinal muscle layer that completely surrounds the diameter of the rectum adding
[00:02:02 -> 00:02:10]  extra support. In the rest of the colon there are three longitudinal muscles that run along
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:21]  the colon forming strips or ribbons called tinea coli. The tinea coli do not surround
[00:02:21 -> 00:02:27]  the entire diameter of the colon and the areas that are not covered by tinea coli are vulnerable
[00:02:27 -> 00:02:40]  to the development of diverticular. Let's talk about diverticulosis. Diverticulosis
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:48]  is sometimes described in layman's terms as wear and tear of the bowel. The most commonly
[00:02:48 -> 00:02:53]  affected section of the bowel is the sigmoid colon, however it can affect the entire large
[00:02:53 -> 00:03:01]  bowel in some patients. Small bowel diverticular are also possible but much less common. Diverticulosis
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:09]  is very common with increased age. Low fibre diets, obesity and the use of non-steroidal
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:16]  anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs are also risk factors. The use of NSAIDs increases
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:28]  the risk of diverticular haemorrhage. Diverticulosis is often diagnosed incidentally on a colonoscopy
[00:03:28 -> 00:03:37]  or a CT scan. Treatment is not necessary where the patient is asymptomatic, however advice
[00:03:37 -> 00:03:50]  regarding a high fibre diet and weight loss is appropriate. Diverticulosis may cause lower
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:58]  left abdominal pain, constipation or rectal bleeding. Management is with increased fibre
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:07]  in the diet and bulk forming laxatives, for example ispigula husk. Stimulant laxatives
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:14]  for example Senna should be avoided as they can make matters worse. Surgery to remove
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:23]  the affected area may be required where there are significant symptoms. Let's talk about
[00:04:23 -> 00:04:31]  acute diverticulitis. Diverticulitis refers to inflammation in the diverticular. Acute
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:37]  diverticulitis presents with pain and tenderness in the left iliac fossa or the lower left
[00:04:37 -> 00:04:53]  abdomen, fever, diarrhoea or loose stools, nausea and vomiting, rectal bleeding, a palpable
[00:04:53 -> 00:05:03]  abdominal mass if an abscess has formed and raised inflammatory markers for example CRP
[00:05:03 -> 00:05:12]  and white blood cell count. The NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries last updated in January
[00:05:12 -> 00:05:20]  2021 suggest management of uncomplicated diverticulitis in primary care with oral Coamoxaclav for
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:29]  at least 5 days, analgesia, particularly avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:36]  and opiates if possible, only taking clear liquids and avoiding solid food until symptoms
[00:05:36 -> 00:05:49]  improve, usually within 2-3 days and follow up within 2 days to review the symptoms. Patients
[00:05:49 -> 00:05:55]  with severe pain or complications require admission to hospital. Hospital treatment
[00:05:55 -> 00:06:01]  involves management as with any patient with an acute abdomen or sepsis including nil by
[00:06:01 -> 00:06:14]  mouth or clear fluids only, IV antibiotics, IV fluids, analgesia, urgent investigations
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:27]  for example a CT scan and urgent surgery may be required if there are complications.
[00:06:27 -> 00:06:36]  Complications of acute diverticulitis are perforation of the bowel, peritonitis, a peridiverticular
[00:06:36 -> 00:06:45]  abscess, a large haemorrhage requiring blood transfusions, fistula, for example between
[00:06:45 -> 00:06:58]  the colon and the bladder or the vagina, and ileus or bowel obstruction. If you like this
