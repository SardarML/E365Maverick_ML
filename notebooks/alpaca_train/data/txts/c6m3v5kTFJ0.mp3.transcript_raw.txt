 I told you in another video, this video is going to be about combining credit cards.  Now this is just a little quick strategy you can use in order to maximize money on one  of your cards, as well as it might even help your total average number of years of history.  So let's say for an example, you got a Capital One card two years ago, and you got a Capital  One card maybe a month ago.  The one limit you had was $1,000 on the first card, the second card it gave you $700, alright?  Your average history now, let's say you had only two cards, for example, I know a lot  of people have more.  Let's say you had two cards.  So it's the average of both your credit lines together.  So one is two years old, one is right now.  So basically looking at a one-year history combined, okay?  What you can do is, once you combine those cards, you want to combine the newest one  with the oldest one.  That way, that actual extra money of limit goes on that card.  So you go from $1,000 to $1,500 in the credit limit, as well as now you're back to a two-year  history, and you're not at a one-year history because of those two accounts, alright?  Now you only have one account with two years of history.  Now of course having a lot more accounts is good, it's great, but if you can get that  card back, you're basically giving that card back almost.  So now you could apply for another card, maybe get some authorized users on that account,  and now apply and get a bigger amount with a different credit company, okay?  You can also get that inquiry deleted from us, and now you got more buying power to get  more cards, alright?  I know Capital One does it, there are other companies that do it as well.  Just call and just ask to see if you can combine cards, make sure you're doing it properly.  On CapitalOne.com, if you do have more than one card, even if it's just three cards, you  can combine all three together.  You can do that all online yourself.  Just make sure you're specifying that you're trying to combine the new ones with the old  ones and not the other way around, so it doesn't mess up your credit history, okay?  It's also a good way to be able to get more or bigger credit line increases.  So if you're only getting $100 increases, or you're only getting, let's say you're only  getting sometimes $50, $200, or they won't even give you an increase, once your amount  goes up, they start giving bigger increases.  So instead of getting $100, they might give you $250 to $300 to $500 increases every time,  instead of just giving you that little bit of an increase, alright?  So that helps that area as well, okay?  So just something to keep in mind, just a little quick strategy, a lot of people don't  know that, I did help about two or three people combine credit cards yesterday, just out the  blue, and I was like, why don't I make a video about that, so that people would know that  you can combine credit cards, and it can help you, it can be for the good, alright?  So I hope you enjoyed that information there, I'm gonna come back with some more information  as well, I'm trying to make sure I have videos out, if not every day, every other day, at  least one every three days, I'll have the live video coming up as well, with some more  information for everybody out there, that they can apply to their credit right now,  or on a monthly basis, just some little things you can do with your credit.  Now, another thing about Capital One, if you're thinking about applying for a Capital One  card, I would suggest you don't do it, the reason why I would suggest that, is because  they're gonna pull all three credit bureaus, instead of pulling one bureau, so let's say  you want to get funding from me, or for yourself, or anything like that, alright?  A lot of companies will pull, well most companies, will pull one bureau, some will pull two,  most will pull one, so if you understand the actual credit algorithm, and you know what  happens when people apply for credit, you will know that, you know, you want to apply  for companies that only pull one bureau, so let's say you're trying to get five credit  cards, okay, now, you can get five credit cards with one credit bureau, so that means  you can just go, and just run your TransUnion up, or run your Experian up, but your Equifax  and TransUnion could be totally clear of inquiries, so you just got five credit cards with this  credit bureau, now you want to get a car, you know, you might go to your credit union,  I would suggest that too, don't go to the bank, I'm sorry, don't go to the car lot,  go to your local bank, and get pre-qualified before you go into the bank, because they  will run your stuff into the ground, they will run your credit so many times, sometimes,  and I just had a friend, he went there, they ran his credit like seven times, he didn't  know until two days later, he texted me like, man, what in the world, they done ran my credit  seven times, and I'm like, bro, that's what they do, like, if you don't say nothing, you  want a car, oh, they'll get you in the car, it's gonna run you for a lot of inquiries,  so to help that, go to your local credit union, get pre-qualified before you go, you can always  take your pre-qualification letter, or how much money you have, to where you're trying  to buy a car from, that way you get one inquiry, and not so many, so it's just a strategy  on how to play with that, so now you got another bureau, let's say Equifax, you got that Equifax  bureau now has one inquiry that you got for your car, so now you got five lines of credit  on Experian, you got one inquiry, you got your car on Equifax, now you decide you want  to get some more cards, now we can go use some inquiries on your Equifax, and use your  trade union to get more cards, or more funding, or a personal loan, or something like that,  but with Capital One, they're gonna pull all three every time, so if you did a car loan  with them, you got two credit cards from them, you got three inquiries on every bureau, so  now you got nine inquiries total, so if you want to get those removed by us, right now  we're doing a special for $40 per inquiry, but that could be up to $50 per inquiry, that's  my normal charge, $50 per inquiry, and so if you have a whole lot more inquiries, I  can lower that price even from $40, if you have a crap ton, I'll make it worth your while,  you know what I'm saying, I'll still lower it even from $40, but you don't want to have  a whole lot of inquiries if you don't have to have them, if that makes sense, so I would  suggest staying away from Capital One, and applying for other people, now if your credit  is just really bad, and you think that Capital One would be the only person to give you a  startup credit card, as far as a main one, and not one of the primary ones I have, in  my primary videos where it talks about those ones that are not Visa's MasterCard, but they  are primaries, if you want to get one that is a Visa MasterCard, and that's your only  shot, I would suggest getting that, I definitely suggest getting the Quicksilver card over  any other card, just because you get that 1.5% cash back, somebody told me the other  day that they have some other platinum cards that do give cash back as well, but I think  the Quicksilver has the best interest rate as well after the introductory, but they don't  really give a lot of big limits for their cards, even if your credit score is pretty  good, there are limits compared to other cards, it's just way low, way lower than most,  so just want to make sure that you know that, so yeah, you can combine credit cards, you  can get other ways to, like I said there are a lot of other ways to spruce up your credit,  but I would say that that is just one little small technique that you could use to apply  to your credit, but not knocking Capital One anyway, I don't want to make it seem like  that, but they do do a lot of small limits, if you can testify to that, leave a comment  about that, if you have a Capital One card and you want to drop some information about  your Capital One card and what your scores were when you applied, let people know that  hey, they don't give a lot of big limits, now for other cards, some of their top tier  cards, yeah, they might give a decent amount, but for the most part, they don't really  give a lot of money up front, so if you need any suggestions on what cards to apply to,  or if you want me to apply for credit cards for you, I'll let you know what that fee is  to do that, I'll help you with funding if you want that, and tell you what the fees  are on the funding as well, and if you have any questions about this video, just leave  a comment, I'll respond to the
