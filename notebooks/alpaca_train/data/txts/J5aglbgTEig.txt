[00:00:00 -> 00:00:08]  Welcome to the MCAT Multimedia Series and to MCAT's Introduction to Anthropology.
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:16]  Anthropology is the study of people and their cultures. Its roots stretch back more than a
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:23]  thousand years to exotic travelers' tales imagining strange societies and peoples whose behavior
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:29]  fascinated early explorers. But scholars began this serious study of human culture
[00:00:29 -> 00:00:35]  only late in the 19th century. Early anthropologists studied customs and beliefs in
[00:00:35 -> 00:00:40]  pre-industrial societies in the hope of opening windows onto their own pasts
[00:00:41 -> 00:00:46]  in order to explain how institutions like religion or the family had come to be.
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:52]  Some of the texts that emerged during this period continue to be influential.
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:59]  Among them, Marcel Mauss' book The Gift, which argued that gifts, far from being free,
[00:00:59 -> 00:01:04]  create complex bonds of reciprocal obligation that help to underpin cultures.
[00:01:05 -> 00:01:11]  It was not until the early 20th century, though, that anthropology began to focus heavily on
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:17]  ethnography, the intensive long-term fieldwork that has become its best-known tool.
[00:01:18 -> 00:01:24]  Franz Boas in the United States and Bronislaw Malinowski in Britain rejected much of their
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:31]  predecessors' work as speculation and insisted on living among the people they studied and talking
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:37]  to them in their own languages. The questions asked by anthropology got more ambitious, too.
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:44]  Rather than trying to understand how institutions developed over time, scholars began to ask how
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:50]  they fitted together to create a functioning society. This is the structural functionalist
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:58]  tradition, perhaps best exemplified by E.E. Evans Pritchard's Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic,
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:03]  a book which demonstrated that belief in witchcraft made perfect sense
[00:02:03 -> 00:02:06]  when understood as a way of keeping order in society.
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:13]  Human culture is complex, and anthropology quickly developed into a number of specializations.
[00:02:14 -> 00:02:19]  Political anthropology questioned the assumptions of global politics,
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:24]  as when James Ferguson issued his challenge to the international development industry
[00:02:24 -> 00:02:30]  in The Anti-Politics Machine and showed that aid is often directed to meet political goals
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:38]  rather than human needs. Medical anthropology explores differing experiences of medicine
[00:02:38 -> 00:02:45]  and disease. And Victor Turner, in The Ritual Process, explored the power of symbols through
[00:02:45 -> 00:02:51]  the performance of religious ceremonies. Feminist anthropology, too, has asked
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:55]  fundamental questions about the ways in which we understand society.
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:03]  Lila Abulugad wonders why Western academics see the clothes worn by Muslim women as symbols of
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:09]  subjugation rather than acceptance of a moral system, and why they expect Afghans to cast
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:15]  aside their burqas when they themselves would never wear a pair of shorts to an opera.
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:22]  The 1960s saw further advances in anthropological theory, beginning with Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss'
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:27]  ambitious attempts to study cultures as structures of human thought.
[00:03:27 -> 00:03:33]  His book Structural Anthropology drew on a model derived from linguistics
[00:03:33 -> 00:03:39]  to introduce what became known as structuralism, the theory that cultures are built on hidden
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:43]  underpinnings formed from human perceptions and activity,
[00:03:43 -> 00:03:47]  and the idea that all of these are constructs that are packed with meaning.
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:55]  A decade later, Clifford Gertz advanced another idea. His The Interpretation of Cultures suggested
[00:03:55 -> 00:03:59]  that cultures should not be studied scientifically and in search of laws,
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:03]  but interpretively, by scholars in search of meaning.
[00:04:04 -> 00:04:10]  This fresh thinking forced a re-examination of much ethnographic fieldwork, but it also
[00:04:10 -> 00:04:15]  liberated anthropology from a focus on the reproduction of culture that had made it
[00:04:15 -> 00:04:17]  blind to social change.
[00:04:19 -> 00:04:25]  Johannes Fabian's Time and the Other provides an example of anthropologists radically rethinking
[00:04:25 -> 00:04:31]  the ways in which they approach the people whom they study. Fabian pointed out how easy
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:36]  it was to fall into the trap of writing about people as if they inhabited not just another
[00:04:36 -> 00:04:43]  place, but another time. His work helped to inspire the development of historical anthropology,
[00:04:44 -> 00:04:49]  and texts like Eric Wolff's Europe and the People Without History, which gave voice to
[00:04:49 -> 00:04:52]  people whose stories had formerly been ignored.
[00:04:54 -> 00:05:01]  Today, anthropologists still seek new ways to re-evaluate old problems and apply ethnographic
[00:05:01 -> 00:05:05]  methods to modern people in a rapidly changing and globalizing world.
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:12]  We'll introduce you to anthropologists' past and present, and to the endlessly fascinating
[00:05:12 -> 00:05:16]  world of human culture. Come inside to find out more.
