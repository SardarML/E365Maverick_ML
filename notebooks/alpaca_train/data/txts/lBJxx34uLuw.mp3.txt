[00:00:00 -> 00:00:18]  In this lesson, we will consider one of the fundamental principles of good governance
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:24]  and the assurance of individual's rights and liberties, which is the rule of law.
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:27]  Now the principle can be succinctly described as
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:34]  the notion that no one is above the law and everyone is subject to the law.
[00:00:34 -> 00:00:38]  There are several associations that we must consider along with the aspect of rule of
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:45]  law, which is that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty, the concept of double
[00:00:45 -> 00:00:50]  jeopardy, which is that a person or an individual cannot be tried for the same offence more
[00:00:50 -> 00:00:56]  than once, and that of legal equality, that everyone is equal before the law.
[00:00:56 -> 00:01:01]  Now there are several theories of law that has been expounded over many centuries, and
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:07]  before we consider rule of law in the context of constitutional law as a subject within
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:12]  an LLB program, it's important to have an understanding of the context and the surrounding
[00:01:12 -> 00:01:17]  aspect and a bit of history of the theories of law that has been expounded.
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:25]  Firstly, you have what is called natural law, which can either be theological or secular.
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:29]  Theological law is the notion that all law is based on God.
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:36]  Secular, conversely, is that it's based on inherent good, or morality for that matter.
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:42]  Conversely, you have positivism, which is the fact that law is what is passed by parliament
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:47]  or some authority, an authoritative body passing law.
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:52]  There have been many different legal luminaries, academics and jurists that have propounded
[00:01:52 -> 00:01:58]  several theories in the notion of law as well as the rule of law.
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:04]  One of the most eminent professors, Professor Joseph Raz, has noted that rule of law can
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:08]  exist without a legal system pursuing moral good.
[00:02:08 -> 00:02:14]  So the rule of law itself need not necessarily be that of moral justifications being propounded.
[00:02:14 -> 00:02:20]  Rather, it is merely much like positivism that we considered earlier, that group or
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:26]  set of laws which has been expounded or which has been stipulated and stated by some greater
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:28]  authority or higher body.
[00:02:28 -> 00:02:32]  But as Professor Raz notes, it must be clear.
[00:02:32 -> 00:02:36]  It must be publicized, as in everyone must know about it.
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:44]  It must be stable, as in not necessarily unamendable, but distinct and definable, not impossible
[00:02:44 -> 00:02:50]  to adhere to, non-contradictory and accessible, along with independence of the judiciary.
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:56]  Now, we noted earlier in terms of the separation of powers that the contemporary context of
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:00]  separation of powers is that the judiciary must be independent.
[00:03:00 -> 00:03:07]  Similarly, Professor Raz notes in his theory that we must consider the rule of law and
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:13]  the perception of laws themselves as well as adherence and governance by it must be
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:19]  in line with the independence of the judiciary as much as the laws themselves and the adjudication
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:22]  of which must be accessible to the individual, to the citizen.
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:29]  Professor Lon Fuller, on the other hand, has considered that the legal system must serve
[00:03:29 -> 00:03:31]  the needs of the people if it is to be obeyed.
[00:03:32 -> 00:03:36]  It must be in the best interests of the people in order for governance to take place and
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:39]  for people to take it seriously and not revolt.
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:45]  One of the prominent jurists and academics, A. V. Dicey, has noted that the supremacy
[00:03:45 -> 00:03:51]  of regular law as opposed to influence of arbitrary power is a succinct manner of considering
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:56]  what exactly rule of law is or trying to amalgamate it into one holistic picture.
[00:03:57 -> 00:04:01]  It also equates to the notion of equality of all classes.
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:07]  Law of the Constitution is also the consequence of the rights of individuals as defined and
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:09]  enforced by the courts, according to Dicey.
[00:04:11 -> 00:04:17]  John Roll noted that similar cases must be treated alike, laws must be known, and laws
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:20]  must abide by natural justice.
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:25]  What you would note from A. V. Dicey, from John Roll, Professor Raz, and even Professor
[00:04:25 -> 00:04:31]  Fuller is that the whole notion of the rule of law is to meticulously protect the rights
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:34]  and liberties of the individual as opposed to the state.
[00:04:35 -> 00:04:40]  Also, it notes that whatever laws that have come about and would come about in the future
[00:04:40 -> 00:04:46]  will only be adhered to if it is in the best moral interest and of moral good to the society
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:49]  at large and to the individual, to the citizen himself.
[00:04:49 -> 00:04:54]  Now that we have a foundation on the concept of the rule of law and a summary of it, let's
[00:04:54 -> 00:05:00]  move on to have a brief outline of certain other aspects of the rule of law.
[00:05:01 -> 00:05:05]  There are several views that have been propounded over the many decades and centuries,
[00:05:05 -> 00:05:10]  but one notable aspect of the rule of law in understanding this principle and concept
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:15]  has been propounded by Hobbes, in which he states that the rule of law deals with the
[00:05:15 -> 00:05:20]  surrendering of rights to procure security, the whole concept of social contract.
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:27]  Hutchinson, on the other hand, notes that it must be a government of laws and not men.
[00:05:27 -> 00:05:32]  The whole premise of the rule of law is that it's not an arbitrary power that has control
[00:05:32 -> 00:05:37]  over an individual or a state, rather a set of rules, a set of laws that has been created
[00:05:37 -> 00:05:43]  by a collective body, contemporarily, for the benefit of the greater good, for society
[00:05:43 -> 00:05:44]  at large.
[00:05:44 -> 00:05:51]  However, when we talk about the rule of law, A. V. Dicey's explanation of the three pillars
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:54]  in terms of rule of law is very important to discuss.
[00:05:54 -> 00:06:00]  And in this light, firstly, he notes that there can be no punishment without a breach
[00:06:00 -> 00:06:00]  of the law.
[00:06:01 -> 00:06:04]  Secondly, everyone is equal before the law.
[00:06:04 -> 00:06:07]  And thirdly, rights are best protected under common law.
[00:06:08 -> 00:06:14]  Having said that, in the modern day context, we see that there has been many criticisms
[00:06:14 -> 00:06:16]  aimed at Dicey's three pillars.
[00:06:16 -> 00:06:22]  Firstly, in terms of there being no punishment without a breach, we see that there are instances
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:27]  where the discretion of the executive rescinds this particular pillar.
[00:06:27 -> 00:06:33]  Sir Ivor Jennings quite clearly noted where in the instance of land is acquired during
[00:06:33 -> 00:06:38]  wartime, the whole premise of a punishment not occurring without breach is completely
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:39]  set aside.
[00:06:40 -> 00:06:47]  Moreover, if we look at cases like Burma Oil and R&R, there is a notion of retrospectivity.
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:50]  Both of these cases are available in your case summaries.
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:55]  When you have a look at them, you would understand how this breaches Dicey's first limb in
[00:06:55 -> 00:06:57]  relation to rule of law.
[00:06:58 -> 00:07:04]  The second limb of Dicey's theory on rule of law has also been criticized once again
[00:07:04 -> 00:07:05]  by Sir Ivor Jennings.
[00:07:06 -> 00:07:13]  In the notion of all being equal before the law, Jennings notes that, for instance, judges
[00:07:13 -> 00:07:19]  and ministers, when you consider the judiciary as well as the legislature and the executive,
[00:07:19 -> 00:07:21]  are immune from certain suits.
[00:07:21 -> 00:07:28]  Therefore, you cannot consider that every single person is equal under the law or before
[00:07:28 -> 00:07:29]  the law.
[00:07:29 -> 00:07:35]  Not all parties are equal and there are certain distinctions between groups of individuals
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:37]  in the state infrastructure itself.
[00:07:37 -> 00:07:43]  Thirdly, when you consider Dicey's third limb that rights are best protected under
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:49]  common law, we see that there is a criticism once again aimed at this third limb due to
[00:07:49 -> 00:07:55]  the UK being part of the European Union and the enactment of the Human Rights Act of 1998
[00:07:55 -> 00:08:01]  bringing into direct effect the European Convention of Human Rights.
[00:08:01 -> 00:08:07]  This being said, it is notable that the Human Rights Act once again is repealable and it
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:13]  is important to note that while this is not as harsh a criticism as that which is propounded
[00:08:13 -> 00:08:18]  by Sir Ivor Jennings in relation to the first and second limb, it is nonetheless important
[00:08:18 -> 00:08:21]  to note in an examination situation.
[00:08:21 -> 00:08:27]  Rule of law is a vast and complicated topic and this was a very brief and succinct overview
[00:08:27 -> 00:08:28]  of it.
[00:08:28 -> 00:08:34]  I urge you to go through your primary sources of academic material which is provided by
[00:08:34 -> 00:08:37]  your university as well as various textbooks.
[00:08:37 -> 00:08:43]  You will find a list of books and sources to actually reference for rule of law as well
[00:08:43 -> 00:08:48]  as every other topic discussed in this course later on in this particular program.
[00:08:49 -> 00:09:05]  In the next lesson, we will consider Parliamentary Sovereignty.
[00:09:07 -> 00:09:12]  Thank you.
