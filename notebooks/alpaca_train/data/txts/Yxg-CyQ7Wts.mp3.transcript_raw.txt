 This video is kindly sponsored by Busuu. So I've been experimenting with  different routines and schedules for the last few years trying to find a lifestyle  that makes me feel motivated to work hard, stay healthy and feel fulfilled. But  the last year or so has been a real game-changer for me. I think I found my  stride in my YouTube videos and in my work and in my work-life balance and I  think I found the secret to never losing my motivation and to making my brain  actually want to do the things that are good for me. We've all had that feeling  your desk is just over there ready and waiting for you but beside you is the oh  so sumptuous dopamine kick calling out to you like Margot Robbie in The Wolf of  Wall Street and like dear old Leo your silly little chimp brain just cannot  resist that oh beautiful sweet sweet taste of someone doing a cool hoodie  removal. And that same lack of motivation to do what we know is really good for us  slaps us in the face every time we think about the pain of going to the gym or  going on a run or sending off that job application that we know we need to send  off even though we keep getting rejected over and over again or sorting through  the hundreds of unread emails filling up our inbox. But how can we trick our  brains into doing stuff that's actually good for us? The workout we can't be  asked to do, the work that doesn't need doing until later this week, the cooking  rather than delivering or you know the endless CV revisions when job  applications keep getting rejected. In this video I'm going to share how I've  gone from endlessly consuming productivity videos kind of like this  one and comparing myself to Matt D'Avella or Ali Abdaal and feeling like a  bit of a failure to a place where I'm actually able to commit long-term to  things, feel like I'm making progress, continue to be motivated to put in the  hours to eat well, to exercise, do my work and feel generally good about myself.  In spite of the fact that Ali Abdaal may appear to be a cybernetic organism who  never sleeps, in fact he may well be one, yet to be proven, but the main reason I  think I personally am able to do all of the stuff I do and stay motivated to do  it all is that I practice sustainability. So I'm first going to explain what I  mean by sustainability and the simple power of sustainability. I'll then move  on to discuss how I believe we've built a really unsustainable and unhealthy  culture around seeing our lives as a series of peaks and troughs. I'll then  move on to my eureka moment when I realized this was completely crazy and  I'll finally conclude by giving you four ways that you can practice  sustainability in your own life. A couple of years ago I enrolled in an intense  two-month German course and I remember I started really motivated and I was like  come on I'm gonna do this. I spent a couple of hours a day for the first few  days trying to struggle through numbers and family members and after that I  basically got to a point where what I'd really looked forward to and learning  German had become this mammoth chore in my life. I felt like I had to dedicate  this two hours a day to it and I pretty quickly gave up. It was simply not  sustainable for me to dedicate two or three hours a day every weekday of my  life to learning German. Compare that experience with what I've had over the  last few weeks. Basically a couple of weeks ago I decided that it would be a  good idea to learn some Japanese and I was really apprehensive going into it  because I didn't want to end up hating even the sound of a Konnichiwa. As I  mentioned I'm already fluent in French and Spanish and Busuu is definitely the  best language learning app I've personally used. It has the depth of  grammar lessons that I was really looking for and it also has this  brilliant feature where you can connect with natives in the language and kind of  share learning with them so they can learn English through me and I can learn  Japanese through them and even at the early stage I've been able to  actually practice pronunciation and get feedback from real Japanese people which  is pretty cool. But best of all it allows me to practice sustainability. It's  powerful AI technology. It does clever things to build a unique study plan just  for you and I found that that has really helped me stick to just 15 minutes a  day I have it set to remind me and I do it like four times a week and that has  allowed me to make real genuine progress in the last couple of weeks but also to  be possible for me to do that and commit to doing it as I go into my busy life as  a corporate lawyer. There's one core principle that we can take from the  comparison of the intense German course and how I am now learning Japanese and  that is that there is a fundamental psychological disconnect between what we  consider to be the need to commit 100% to doing something in order to make  progress and conversely the need which is the actual need to make sure that we  want to do something and that we continue to want to do something in the  long term in order to make progress over the long term. So you can start learning  a language for free through Busuu using the link in the description to download  the app. In my first year at Cambridge I was really determined to do  extremely well in my exams obviously but I was also you know wanting to make  amazing friends and get involved in societies and do as much as I could.  The fundamental problem was I was just filling all of my hours of every single  day with stuff I was doing you know I was probably going to bed about 2 a.m.  most nights and that was either just chilling with friends in my room or it  might have been you know going on a night out but basically I was going  through these cycles of working really hard maybe then pushing myself to burn  out beyond burnout and having then needing to take a day or two off and  then repeating this kind of cyclical pattern of all out, crash for a day or  two and repeat. And fundamentally that just isn't healthy and I ended up  giving myself IBS, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, in my first term. But the  fundamental problem is that these cycles are vicious and you know it's  really bizarre we've built this society that somewhat idolizes the very idea of  pushing yourself beyond your limits you know you only have to watch the social  network to see Mark Zuckerberg crazily coding for 20 hours a day to believe  that that is the only way to create a successful business for example or going  to university the only way to be successful is to work until the early  hours of the morning like a crazy person and the reality is that just isn't true  but it's worth bearing in mind there is a huge confirmation bias at play here  you know we okay hear the stories of the successful people who worked really hard  but we don't hear of the stories of the people who failed even though they  worked insanely hard and who pushed themselves to the point of being ill  depressed or just frankly miserable. I had this eureka moment in my second year  at university and it genuinely has to a degree changed my life and I don't say  that lightly like I genuinely hope that this has a similar impact on you just  hearing this story and it's a very simple story it's basically Derek  Silver's is really into mountain biking he loves going off on this one  particular trail he always times himself and he knows that it always takes him 43  minutes he pushes himself to his absolute limit beads dripping sweat and  it takes him 43 minutes every time he's like maxed out and one day he says right  okay so I'm just gonna go out and actually enjoy the cycle like I'm gonna  go out and not push myself to my limits and I'm just gonna see how I go and he  gets the end he's you know gone through these beautiful fields and actually  looked at them for the first time and he gets the end of his cycle he looks at  his watch which records how quickly he's gone and it says 45 minutes you  like no no that must be wrong like I I mustn't have started it but no he had  started at the right time and it had taken him a whole two minutes longer in  spite of the fact that he had actually enjoyed it and the fundamental message I  took away from this is that when you are studying when you are working when I'm  making my videos when I'm doing anything that I do I constantly now try  to bear in mind this story and that is and then the message of the story which  is this if you ever feel like you're at the point of just oh like I cannot take  any more of this like I've had enough I'm pushing myself so hard I just  haven't got to where I want to feel frustrated all of those feelings take a  breath and stop until you enjoy it again allow yourself to bring whatever  you're doing down to a level where you can actually enjoy it and I genuinely  believe that there are very few people very few things anyone can be doing and  I you know went to one of the most rigorous universities in the world I've  studied law I've done an intense kind of law course I understand that we're under  considerable pressure but I think in life we often put ourselves under even  more pressure than we're actually under and I think just taking a moment to take  a step back and at times when the going gets really tough to be able to say no  it is not a sign of strength for me to push through this pain and burn myself  out and then need two weeks off it is a sign of strength to recognize that I am  at the point of just breaking really and pushing myself to a place where I don't  want to be and slowing down and saying I need to make this sustainable the key is  to make things that are good for us appealing to us and that is by giving  your brain the dopamine kick at least to start with that it constantly craves so  it is optimizing to make the things you're going to be doing so that you can  both make as much progress as quickly as possible which is kind of the  conventional logic but also optimized so that you can continue doing them and to  stay in doing them for as long as possible so let's dive into the four  ways I've been actively pursuing a more sustainable approach to everything I do  first up lower activation energy and what I mean by activation energy is  basically the energy required for you to make yourself do something in the first  place so for example if you're sitting down to study or you're thinking just  about like going to the gym and you think oh that's gonna really hurt oh  that's gonna be really boring that is creating a high level of activation  energy required to make yourself do that thing however if we can bring that  activation energy down then you're gonna require less energy to commit to doing  it and it's just gonna be generally easier for you to start and you're gonna  be way less likely to procrastinate if you imagine that you're in a car if  you're not moving at all it's really hard to change direction when you're not  moving you can't change direction when you're not moving however conversely if  you imagine that you're in a car and you're moving however slowly you can  always change direction and so I don't just waffle on about cars for no reason  the reason I say this is that if you imagine you're in a car basically what  you want to do is just get the ball rolling you want to get the wheels  turning with anything you can do that's even remotely related so with studying  for example I really like to first thing on a morning when I get up I'll often if  I'm feeling like particular I just really cannot be bothered I'll sit down  on my desk and I'll just pull up a 10 minute like first 10 minutes of a  lecture I'll sit back I'll maybe have my breakfast with me and I'll just watch  that bit of the lecture I won't take any notes I won't do anything and that  requires very little activation energy and it sucks me into them being like oh  this is actually not so bad I'm gonna continue to this I'm gonna make notes  and suddenly I'm in it and I've kind of overcome that initial barrier anything  you can do to lower activation energy is a good thing and the same applies to  exercise I'll often say right I'm just gonna do five minutes of stretching or  I'm gonna do a quick fire ten minute workout and that's it and very often I'll  find that right once I've got started I'm like ah this is not so bad I'm  actually quite enjoying this I'll just keep going and I end up doing half an  hour but if I'd said in the first place right I'm gonna do a half an hour  workout I'd have said no thank you very much I will do that tomorrow and  probably not do it tomorrow either and one final quick idea is that you can  always start the day by making a to-do list and I like to include a daily  highlight for later in the day and also just really break things down into small  manageable chunks and you might be able to give yourself a couple of like oh  yeah that's really easy that's gonna take me like two minutes and I can tick  something off my to-do list and that just gets the ball rolling for the day I  also applied the principle of lowering activation energy more broadly to my  life so for example I won't undertake overly ambitious projects or set myself  like hugely ambitious goals right at the outset instead I'll cut my teeth on  smaller projects first so that means for example when I wrote my book I wrote a  series of blog posts first or when I started on YouTube I made a series of  small life hack videos and okay they did terribly but I gave it a go before I  really committed to kind of taking it more seriously so yourself little mini  projects with set deadlines limited scope and a much more manageable  workload so that you can feel like you're really getting somewhere when you  complete these little things and maybe move on to bigger projects rather than  setting yourself this huge project with tons of things to do such that you feel  that you're constantly swimming against this endless tide of tasks without ever  really getting to where you want to get to second is just the idea that you're  much more likely to succeed if you avoid an all-consuming infatuation with  achieving your goals there is nothing wrong with goals in and of themselves in  my opinion and I do set myself goals however I think it's important that we  try and I am trying to remain focused on the process of working towards those  goals on actually enjoying whatever it is I'm doing and on building habits  around the actions that we're trying to kind of complete rather than just adding  something onto a to-do list so that we can tick it off it's this idea from  James Clear's Atomic Habits that if we set ourselves a short-term goal and work  as hard as we can towards achieving that goal that isn't actually the best way to  be productive you know if you set yourself a goal or tidying your room  right now there's no guarantee that in the long term you're going to keep your  room tidy it's really about avoiding cycles of all-or-nothing which cause  dread when you think about the pain of going to the gym and pushing yourself to  the limit or the dread of tidying your horrendously messy bedroom instead we  need to practice moderation and do things in smaller bite-sized chunks and  that's really the approach I've adopted with this YouTube channel you know  everyone says you've got to be consistent you've got to put out a video  every single week in order to succeed and I said well no I'm not willing to do  that like I just don't have time or the energy to do that and if I try to do  that for a couple of months and put out a video every single week I'm probably  going to end up absolutely hating this and you guys know I would never hate you  guys but you get the point and so I have committed yes okay I'm going to accept  that I may not grow my channel quite as quickly as other people but I'm going to  enjoy this process and I'm going to ensure that I can continue to do this in  the long term that is an idea I picked up from Ali Abdaal and it's a simple  phrase if this isn't nice I don't know what is and basically my opinion is that  giving yourself a little bit more space you know going for a run and not pushing  yourself to the absolute limit or studying I think oh this is actually  quite interesting rather than just pushing yourself to get it done it opens  up more space for these moments when you can say if this isn't nice I don't know  what is you know this is actually pretty amazing I'm pretty lucky to have this  experience and these moments can be pretty mundane you know I was studying  really hard the other day I was like right I'm just gonna take 10 minutes off  and enjoy a little bit of time with Winston and he's so cute or you know it  could be for example when I'm out on my run I just go a little bit slower and I  think wow this scenery is really beautiful I'm so lucky to live here or  when for example the other day we were on a drive just me and my girlfriend  Beth and I thought wow this is just really nice this is really special to  have this moment with her just the Sun setting and we've got the music blaring  and we're just having a great time nothing special in of these moments like  themselves but to me they're special and I was able without pushing myself to my  limits to just enjoy those moments finally and this is kind of returning to  the Derek Siver story I told earlier I think we all need to and it's something  I've really worked on to be more aware of when we need a break of when we're at  that really ouch point of just like I can't go any further without doing  myself some harm and being aware of that and being able to say no I need to  prioritize high quality downtime at this point I need to be intentional with my  time and say no no more and this is something I sucked at in my first year  at university I you know push myself beyond my limits I was aware that my  kind of physical and mental health you know my stomach was really bad and I was  failing to do anything about it because okay I was aware of it but I wasn't  willing to kind of make myself fully aware of it and actually do something  about it and so this this final point is really just know when and be conscious  of when you feel too tired when you think you need a break and allow  yourself to have it and allow yourself to accept that having a whole day off  even though there are deadlines impending think what's the worst that  can happen probably not that much and it's probably a much worse outcome if I  continue to push myself to my limits and beyond so time to have a break I  want to finish this video with one final and very quick qualification and that is  that hard work is absolutely I have no doubts about it a fundamental kind of  component of success and I am myself probably one of the hardest working  people I know maybe with a couple of exceptions but this is not about working  insanely hard pushing yourself to your limits in short doses and then giving up  it's about practicing being able to moderately and over long periods of time  work hard such that you actually get towards the end result that you're after  rather than making huge progress very quickly but then giving up and never  actually arriving at the destination remember you can download boost you  through
