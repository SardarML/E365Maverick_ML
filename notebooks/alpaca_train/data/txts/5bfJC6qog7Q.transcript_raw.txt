 Music  He's pretty good with those.  He is, very good.  My name is Kyle and I'm the northern flicker.  And run if your bird forages on the ground.  Forages on the ground.  My name is Great Horned Owl Thomas.  And my bird comes out in the daytime in winter.  So run if your bird comes out during the day.  Yeah.  The name Black-capped Chickadee must mean it has a black head.  So it has a black head.  And the eyes are black so the eyes are hard to see.  And run if your bird is a bird.  Ed Wing Blackbird again.  Bird lays eggs. Run.  Wait, what?  Lays eggs.  My bird is the Red-tailed Hop.  And it preys on about anything that it can eat.  And if it has to, it will eat small domestic dogs and cats.  Like Rosie's dog.  And run if your bird has a really loud screech.  I'm not sure about screech.  Can't you hear that?  Great Blue Heron Michael.  And I haven't been given any facts.  So the Great Blue Heron is a master of the stalk.  And it waits sometimes for hours in big stillness by the water's edge.  And it can peck at fish or small mammals.  Sometimes insects.  Run if your bird migrates for the winter.  Billy, this is yours.  This is yours.  You did it again.  Kind of like you, Wes.  Do it kind of like that.  But I can't whistle.  Yeah, he can't.  He can't whistle.  There it is.  Small problem.  That's a nice one.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a little bigger.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You have to be careful.  Yeah.  Good job, Christian.  Thanks.  All right.  Thank you, man.  All right, see you.  Get it?  Yeah.  Good job, Michael.  Nice.  Another one.  Same spot.  Okay.  Now there's one pole missing right here.  Yeah.  Let me tie that.  See the teepee.  It's a little bit off.  Get it?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Got it.  Got it.  Yeah.  Get it, Michael.  Yeah.  You got it.  Yeah.  You got it.  Yeah.  You got it.  Good job.  Oh, this is a good one.  Yeah.  All right.  There's one bolt missing right here.  You tie that to the teepee and put it up.  Spread it both directions.  Now there's our slack coming all the way to the bottom here.  Or closer to it.  There we go.  There we go.  So, what did you make here?  Just grass pounded into a liquid.  It tastes really bad.  It tastes like lawn, right?  No, I already tasted it.  Ten.  Nine.  Eight.  Seven.  Six.  Five.  Four.  Three.  Two.  One.  Is that some right behind that cedar?  Or is that just someone's coat?  I think it's just a coat.  Don't be too sure.  Alright.  Twenty.  Nineteen.  Eighteen.  Seventeen.  Sixteen.  Fifteen.  Fourteen.  Thirteen.  Twelve.  Eleven.  Ten.  Nine.  Eight.  Seven.  Six.  Five.  Four.  Three.  Two.  One.  I see a cherry there.  I see something behind this close cedar.  A little shrubby, yellowish-white thing.  What's up, Tom?  Back home.  Told you, the yellow.  Oh, someone's got some red, uh, like, kind of the way towards where camp is, and, uh,  you're laying down, you're not moving yet, but I see you.  Oh, yeah.  27, 28, 29, 30.  Okay.  See you, Shiley.  Yep.  I see you.  Oh, it's good.  There was a mosquito on the back of my arm when I tried to pull it off, and I lost it  once or twice.  Unfortunate.  We're all falling.  80,000.  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  2,500.  I saw you, like, five years ago.  You already know, right?  Okay, stop moving.  Oh, my God.  You have something to put in there?  Shiley, can I do more potatoes?  Oh, yeah, that'll be better.  Yeah, that's going to require stitches.  Are you getting lightheaded yet?  Nope, you stay down.  Okay.  I don't want to bleed through the gauze, so as...  As we all stay down, got our plug in the hole.  Thank you.  Wow, the smell is so good, and that's so much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm ready for my home dinner, because I'm going home.  Hold up, hold up, hold up, come on.  Just leave it.  Make a teepee.  He's a master at this.  There's so much smoke in here.  We're going to get smoked out.  Okay.  Nice.  Beeples.  Do you want moose meat?  Yes.  Here's that.  Moose meat?  There we go, thank you.  Just do a few sheets at a time, whatever doesn't stress the hole puncher too much.  And right where these marks are, you kind of, you know, you just go in not too close to the edge.  And just hole punch and get all those, get all those hole punched there.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So you want to make sure it's in the right spot.  And to know that, you're going to have this piece kind of come up to where it covers it all.  Have you seen how they're doing it over there?  With the filling?  Essentially, you know how like a binder works?  It has those metal rings?  What this all means is that the left side here, I'm going to put kind of over the right side like that.  And then, and now they've switched, so now this is the right and this is the left.  Have a piece of wood behind you?  Like a, yeah, that'll work.  Hey guys, I just want you to take one minute and look at what Jerry's doing here.  Okay.  All right, go.  Oh, I have to go.  Oh, it's too cold.  Don't run around, you'll be sweaty.  Yeah, I'm not running.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  No.  Ow.  Oh.  A razor can be 10 degrees but be dull, whereas a mallet can be like 40 degrees but be sharp.  In the sense that it's not the angle of the bevel, it's the, how fine the edge is.  There's higher quality stones, but this, you know, this works.  And so, you know, there's a coarse and a fine side.  But essentially, you have it on there, and then I'll rotate it so that it's on that bevel.  So, you know, you go like 10 strokes or so one way, and then you just flip it over like that.  And you got to come back the other way.  Like a common mistake is you'll be going, and then you're like, get really like narrow at the edge or something.  So it'll be a good bevel, and then all of a sudden you'll be taking like too much off at the tip here.  And so you want to kind of like bring the knife up a little bit just so you're staying at a good spot.  We can go faster. Retire.  Retire. Advance. Advance.  Retire. Retire. To the right.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Pause in your spot.  Pause in your spot. To the left. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  Pause in your spot. Here we go. Pause in your spot. Advance. Advance.  Retire. Retire.

Winner.  round drill out of this end piece and make a flat fireboard over there and if  you have you can't do this with a folding knife but it works very well  with a fixed blade knife like this now we have a fireboard and drill a socket  what are we missing for a bow and drill and so sometimes I'd flip it around and  come from that side but in this case I think that one string could work but it  might also break and I don't really want to risk that so I'm going to strengthen  it by putting two together  down here come down I'm going to do a clove hit so basically I'm going to make  an X like that and then I'm going to take the string back under the middle  there we go any questions before we break you up into teams
