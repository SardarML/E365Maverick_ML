 Welcome to Premath. In this video lesson we have got this exponential equation x  power x minus 1 whole square equals to 2x plus 1 and now we are going to find  the value of x minus 1 over x. Please don't forget to give a thumbs up and  subscribe. So let's go ahead and get started with the solution and here's the  very first thing we are going to do. Let's go ahead and take care of the left  hand side of this given equation and here I have copied down this left hand  side of this given equation. Now let's focus on this part x minus 1 whole  square and we are going to use this binomial formula a minus b square so  this could be written as x power this x minus 1 square could be written as x  square minus 2x and then plus 1 and now let's focus on this exponent part x  square minus 2x plus 1 and here I have copied it down and let's go ahead and  manipulate this one. I can write this 1 as I can write 2 minus 1 so therefore  this could be written as x square minus 2x and then plus 2 minus 1. Now I'm  gonna rearrange these one I'm gonna put these one together and these one  together as well so I can write x square and then a plus 2 and then minus 2x  and then minus 1. Now let's go ahead and simplify furthermore x square then plus  2 and here I can take this negative sign outside so this could be written as  negative outside 2x and then plus 1 inside the parentheses therefore we can  write this one x power I'm going to replace this one by this different form  so I can write x square and then plus 2 and then minus 2x and then plus 1 and  now we are going to use this product rule according to this rule I can put  this part and this part separately so therefore I can write this one as x  power x square and then plus 2 and then times x power negative and in parentheses  2x and then plus 1 and now let's focus on this factor x power this negative  exponent negative 2x plus 1 we are going to use this fact and we can write as a  positive exponent when we bring it down to the denominator. Let's go ahead and  write it down this part is going to stay same so x power x square plus 2 at the  numerator divided by this part is going to come to the denominator so this could  be written as 2 power with the 2x plus 1 and now we can see that this our left  hand side has been transformed into this form so we are going to replace this  left hand side by this and now in this next step our left hand side is this new  part and this right hand side is exactly the same 2x plus 1 and now let's go  ahead and remove this fraction by multiplying both side by x power 2x plus  1 on this side and times x power 2x plus 1 on this side as well and here we can  see that this thing cancels out with this one so we ended up on the left hand  side as x power x square and then plus 2 equals to here I can see that I can  write this one 2x and then plus 1 inside parentheses times x power 2x and then  plus 1. Now let's focus on this left hand side we're going to be using this  product rule once again I'm going to write these two parts of this exponents  separately so the left hand side could be written as x power x square and then  times x power 2 and on the right hand side this thing is exactly same 2x plus  1 and then times x power 2x plus 1 and now in the next step I am going to  commute their positions of these two factors so I can rearrange them I can  write x square first and then times x power x square and the right hand side  is going to be exactly same and now in this next step I have wrote down this  part in parentheses as you can see over here and this exponent x square in  parentheses as well and the right hand side is exactly same now in this next  step we are going to use this rule according to this rule we can see that  this x square and this x square is going to be our a this 2x plus 1 and this 2x  plus 1 is going to be our b then according to this rule this could be  written as a equals to b that means x square equals to 2x and plus 1 and  since we are running out of space on the left hand side I just copied down this  one right as you can see and now we have this thing x square equals to 2x plus 1  let's go ahead and move this one on the left hand so we can write this thing as  x square minus 1 equals to 2x go ahead and divide both side by x I'm gonna  divide this one by x this one by x and this one by x across the board and now  we can see x square divided by x is simply is going to give us x minus this  thing becomes 1 over x equals to here x and x they cross each other out so we  got 2 so therefore our x minus 1 over x value turns out to be 2 which is going  to be this is what we are looking for so thus our x minus 1 over x value turns  out to be 2 thanks for watching and please don't forget to subscribe to my  channel for more exciting videos.
