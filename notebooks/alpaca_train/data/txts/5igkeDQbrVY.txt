[00:00:00 -> 00:00:06]  Statistics is all about data. In fact data are the life and blood of statistics.
[00:00:06 -> 00:00:13]  I would argue that without data in fact there is no statistics. When it comes to
[00:00:13 -> 00:00:18]  data it comes in all shapes and sizes and if you have been paying attention to
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:21]  what is happening and what has been happening in the world as of late
[00:00:21 -> 00:00:26]  especially around since 2010 and 11 you would notice that the real buzz is
[00:00:26 -> 00:00:34]  around big data and corporations, governments, individuals they all want to
[00:00:34 -> 00:00:39]  do something with big data and they don't want to be seen without big data.
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:43]  In fact a colleague and I wrote a paper in the International Journal of
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:48]  Information Management and we critically looked at this this concept of big data
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:54]  and we called it beyond the hype because we realized that it was more hype to big
[00:00:54 -> 00:01:01]  data than what was in fact possible with it. In fact I would argue that most
[00:01:01 -> 00:01:04]  companies and individuals would have what we called small data something that
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:08]  fits on your hard drive or the hard drive of your computer or something that
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:14]  you can work with with a small server and if you notice a lot of data that we
[00:01:14 -> 00:01:19]  work with in real life not just at universities and schools is small to
[00:01:19 -> 00:01:24]  medium-sized data and thinking of data you have to realize how it's collected
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:29]  and how it's generated. A large number of data sets are collected through surveys
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:36]  you have been a recipient of such unsolicited phone calls or people
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:39]  stopping you on the street asking you can you spare five minutes for a survey.
[00:01:39 -> 00:01:44]  There are cross-sectional data in fact what happens is that from a random
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:50]  sample of individuals representing some population we conduct a survey and ask
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:54]  them a question at a point in time and in fact we get a cross-section of
[00:01:54 -> 00:02:00]  opinions at that particular time. Another way of collecting data is to ask
[00:02:00 -> 00:02:06]  the same question to the same people repeatedly over a longer period such as
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:13]  tracking children from the age of say five to their adolescence and all
[00:02:13 -> 00:02:19]  the way to their adulthood. So over a 30-year period you test their IQ scores,
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:25]  their behavioral attitudes, their attitudes towards life, the choices
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:30]  they made for education and careers and family and that kind of data would be
[00:02:30 -> 00:02:36]  longitudinal or panel data. Another kind of data that you are most likely to be
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:42]  familiar with is called time series data. If you look at housing prices a graph of
[00:02:42 -> 00:02:46]  housing prices going up and down or unemployment rate fluctuating over time
[00:02:46 -> 00:02:51]  these are called time series data. You're collecting this information about
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:57]  the same entity over time. What is called big data is essentially the
[00:02:57 -> 00:03:04]  web-based data or data that is being continuously generated by smartphones
[00:03:04 -> 00:03:10]  or information technology enabled devices that keep generating this
[00:03:10 -> 00:03:16]  data automatically and the size of that data is humongous and that's why
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:22]  it's called big data. The data set once it's in a tabular format and that
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:28]  would be the focus of this statistics 101, that data has variables and
[00:03:28 -> 00:03:33]  those variables would have certain types and we'll discuss them later. Since
[00:03:33 -> 00:03:39]  business analytics and social sciences rely to a great deal on survey data let
[00:03:39 -> 00:03:45]  us discuss it briefly. If you have been paying attention to the news or to
[00:03:45 -> 00:03:48]  television you know that in the United States we had the
[00:03:48 -> 00:03:54]  presidential elections and what happened is that for a very sustained period of
[00:03:54 -> 00:04:03]  time the polls that is the surveys done of eligible voters suggested that one
[00:04:03 -> 00:04:07]  candidate would win over the other. The odds of one candidate was significantly
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:11]  higher as per the survey data but then it turned out at the night of election
[00:04:11 -> 00:04:15]  election night people realized that evening that the polls were horribly
[00:04:15 -> 00:04:21]  wrong. So survey data is very useful but I would start with the caveat that the
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:26]  quality of data determines the quality of analysis and while I'm mentioning
[00:04:26 -> 00:04:32]  these polls went wrong I would like to mention Warren Mitovsky who is one of
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:37]  the pioneers of exit polling data and as we go along I hope that we get a
[00:04:37 -> 00:04:42]  chance to revisit some of his work but in the end of the day you have many
[00:04:42 -> 00:04:45]  companies individuals who collect data even the government collects data
[00:04:45 -> 00:04:49]  through polls and the United States Census Bureau not only does census which
[00:04:49 -> 00:04:53]  essentially is is a survey of all individuals or supposed to be a survey
[00:04:53 -> 00:04:59]  of all individuals in the US and same is the case with the Census Bureau's or
[00:04:59 -> 00:05:04]  agencies in Europe and in other parts then there are professional
[00:05:04 -> 00:05:09]  organizations that do service for businesses and governments Gallup is one
[00:05:09 -> 00:05:14]  such agency and then there are think tanks or fact tanks such as the Pew
[00:05:14 -> 00:05:19]  Research Center that collect data on matters of that are of importance
[00:05:19 -> 00:05:26]  sociologically socially or politically or economically. One good thing about Pew
[00:05:26 -> 00:05:33]  Research Center is that it makes its data available to all. In this particular
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:40]  course we will routinely use a data set from University of Texas provided by
[00:05:40 -> 00:05:45]  Professor Daniel Hammermesh. Professor Hammermesh is an author and a celebrated
[00:05:45 -> 00:05:51]  economist who have been looking over the years as to how your one's appearances
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:58]  or looks impact their economic or other outcomes. His book Beauty Pays is an
[00:05:58 -> 00:06:03]  interesting read and I highly recommend it. The data set looks as follows we have
[00:06:03 -> 00:06:07]  beauty which is the rating of the instructors physical appearance by a
[00:06:07 -> 00:06:13]  panel of six students and then teaching evaluation which is the lowest could be
[00:06:13 -> 00:06:19]  one and highest could be five. Notice that beauty and evaluation are continuous
[00:06:19 -> 00:06:26]  variables or real numbers so evaluation could be 4.1 4.2 they're not integers
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:32]  whereas minority status is sort of a factor variable or a categorical
[00:06:32 -> 00:06:38]  variable it's either 1 or 0 if a person is a is a non-caucasian or visible
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:45]  minority 1 0 otherwise then gender would also be a categorical variable or a
[00:06:45 -> 00:06:50]  dichotomous that could take only one or the other value so gender, native, tenure
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:56]  are all dichotomous variables. So we will discuss these types as we go along and
[00:06:56 -> 00:07:03]  as we work with data but understanding the type of variable and the kind of
[00:07:03 -> 00:07:07]  analysis one can perform based on the type of variable is very important to
[00:07:07 -> 00:07:11]  get right from the word go.
