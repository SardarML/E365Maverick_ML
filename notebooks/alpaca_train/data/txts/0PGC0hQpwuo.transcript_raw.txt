 hi I'm back so I haven't made video in quite a while and this is because I have  been busy doing my master's thesis and and tomorrow is my defense so I've  already turned my present my master's thesis in and then tomorrow I have to do  a presentation on for like 15 minutes and present all the research that I've  done and the results that I and gathered and I am super nervous I am so nervous  and so I've been practicing my presentation and I thought maybe it  would be a good idea to record it because that way I can time myself and  also I thought you would probably be interested in my master's thesis as well  so and I want to try to record my the presentation I've prepared now okay  hello everyone I would like to present today my master's thesis on the topic of  design optimization in early project stages a generative design approach to  project development and my presentation is roughly structured in background  methodology and if we have time we'll talk about verification but most  importantly the implementation and their experiment that I carried out as  well as their results and a discussion so the problem that my thesis was based  on is that in project development as it is the initial phase of any potential  construction project we want to determine whether or not the project  would be profitable but at this point no design exists yet so all the  calculations and studies that we carry out are based on estimates and past  experience so the question is is it possible to automate parts of the design  finding process so that we can provide a reliable model based data for project  development and this involves a design optimization that regards large aspects  such as the position of the building on site but also down to the smallest  entity that will in my case be a singular desk and its placement so for  human it can be very hard to regard all these aspects at the same time but with  a computer we can look at a lot more design options a lot faster and through  multi-objective optimization we can be able to find well-performing design  solutions so how does it work its background lies in and the natural  principle of evolution so through mutation we get different variations of  genes and then through natural selection those that don't perform well get ruled  out and this process repeats itself until we end up with a diverse set of  very well adapted genes and if we translate that to design the individuals  in a population are the different design solutions and the genes the chromosomes  are represented by the values of the properties of the model so in a  parametric model the values for the parameters so what we want to do is  basically generate a bunch of different design solutions evaluate them based on  their performance and then use the principles of evolution to optimize them  and generate new solutions and to imitate this process of evolution a few  different genetic algorithms have been developed in the past couple of decades  the ones that we use today work quite similarly so a population is generated  then for each individual the fitness is calculated and then we use the  evolutionary operators of selection crossover and mutation to create a new  generation and what a genetic algorithm is supposed to do is preserve previously  found good solutions that is a principle called elitism and progress to the true  Pareto front as fast as possible which is the convergence rate as well as and  this is especially important in design provide a diverse set of solutions to  the human decision maker so that the final solution can be selected by the  human designer and this is especially important in design because we are most  of the time dealing with multi objective optimization problems that means we have  multiple often contradicting design goals or objectives so how in this case  how can we determine if one solution is better than another and this is where  the concept of non domination comes in that says a one solution is better than  the other if it is equal or if it scores equal or higher in all of the objectives  but better in at least one of them so if we look at this sketch here we can see that we  have two objectives F1 and F2 and we want that we want to minimize so in this case  we can say C is dominated by both A and B because A and B score better in the design  objectives however and A and B are not dominated by any other solution and therefore lie on the  Pareto front so as I said there are a few different genetic algorithms but one that  is very common is called the NSGA2 and it evaluates and what's specific about it is  that it evaluates the parents together with the children population which ensures elitism  and then uses a fast sorting algorithm to divide the populations into subgroups and  uses the crowding distance comparison to prefer solutions that come from a less  crowded region so that preserves diversity of the solution. Now to carry out a generative  design study we need three things we need a parametric model that is able to explore  the entire solution space we need a set of design goals and they're very important because  they will determine what kind of outcome what kind of results we will receive and we need an  optimization engine so in this case I chose the NSGA2 algorithm because it has proven to provide  a very diverse set of solution and it is implemented in the Dynamo plugin called Refinery. Now as an  example for my studies I used the Siemens construction excellence which is an architectural  and technical standard for Siemens office buildings. Now this is what a standard floor  plan looks like and we can see that it basically consists of three elements the core units which  accommodate the stairs and the toilets then we have the office units where the actual desks  are placed and then the seam units where the fire escapes are so the core unit and the seam  unit are always the same but for the office units there are six different configurations  from a very dense layout with 20 desks per unit to more looser setups of 12  desks per unit. Now what we can say is that the width of the building is always fixed but the  length of the building is determined by how many of those units we line up so to translate this  into a parametric model I work like this so we start out with the project data which is the same  for all the solutions so we need the outline of the site  in this case I chose my current Siemens project in Hannover and the number of employees that  work there so in this case it was five we needed 500 workplaces then two variables  the start point and the orientation determine the largest inscribed rectangle so essentially  the area where we can grow the building now we check is the rectangle fully within the site  and then we have two more variables the number of units left and right that we add onto the core  and then of course the last units on each side get turned into seam units now we can check  are all the units within the rectangle and therefore they will be within the site  and then lastly we have a variable called workplace density that determines how many  how dense we pack the workplaces in in the units and therefore determines how many  workplaces we have per floor and then we need to replicate the the floors until we have reached the  500 workplaces in total so this is what this looks like a dynamo so we have here the variables  and when we start twitching one of them so for example here increase the workplace density  and then we will need less floors fewer floors to accommodate all workplaces however if we  decrease the number of slices on one side the building will rise again because it will need  more floors to accommodate all workplaces and and what we can also see is already is that  whenever we change one of the variables the scoring in the objectives of this of the design  changes as well so what i did here manually refinery does automatically in the optimization  it is able to dock onto the variables and change them and observe the output  now if we have that parametric model we need to talk about the design goals so the objectives  the direction of the optimization so together with siemens we chose eight different design goals that  are most important to them in the project development so for example we want to increase  the comfort for the workplaces there so this is measured by the rentable area that is available  per workplace on the other hand we want to limit the energy that is consumed by the buildings so  we want to minimize the ratio of surface to volume or for example to optimize the position of the  building on site we we want to minimize the path from the outside of the site to the building  entrance so now before we start the evolution we need there's a few more parameters that we need to  set first the population size so it's the number of individuals that are in one generation the  number of generations so how many iterations the genetic algorithm will run the crossover  probability which is how often crossover will occur and the mutation probability which is how  often we will have mutation so for the population size and it's good to have bigger population size  because that means the chances are higher that a good solution is already part of the very first  generation however if the population size becomes too big it also takes very long to rule out bad  performing solutions so there's an ideal population size for every optimization problem and in my case  i detected it at a population size of 120 members per population and then i increased the number of  generations until the average fitness of the population increased no further or very little  which was about after 50 generations so i set the algorithm to work and received 14  results from the Pareto front with very different scorings in each design objective so we can see  the scoring here in this overview and the decision maker will then be able to  select solutions based on like personal preference so if they rather want to go with an decreased  footprint or more rentable area etc so afterwards i carried out interviews with some project managers  from Siemens to find out how happy they were with the process and the feedback that i got was  overall positive so they see a high potential in generative design especially because it prohibits  the manipulation of design processes that are often manipulated by personal or internal political  interests but with generative design the hope is that the decision making  process would become objective and data driven however there was also the wish for more  objectives to be included for example the site topology local code requirements or the  surrounding landscape and buildings so to conclude i would say the most important thing in a generative  design study is to have a clear concept of the design variables that you want to include and  the objectives that you choose because that will very much influence the quality of the results  that you will get because there are essentially endless possibilities of what objectives to choose  and you have to consider what is most important to you is it really important to have a beautiful  view from your desk or is that something that is more nice to have but not a priority  because it's easy to implement a lot of different factors but it will also influence what kind of  results you will get and some other things on the other hand they're very hard to teach the  algorithm so for example for human it's very easy to place a rectangle within another shape  but in my study i had to spend a lot of time and effort into teaching the algorithm how to avoid  invalid designs so designs that are outside of the the site so how can we punish those solutions  and teach the algorithm to rule them out as fast as possible  also throughout the study i developed the opinion that the term generative design itself might be a  bit misleading because the computer does not generate a design it doesn't have any inherent  creativity the human designer has to create an abstract vision a concept of its design  and then the computer merely finds the best set of parameter values that  that optimize the design concept to goals that they're also the human defined so therefore i  think the term generative design gives the computer a bit too much credit as so to say  however i also have to say that setting up the algorithm and then letting the optimization run  felt really liberating because i knew that now my computer would like work and work for me  essentially for the next five hours and there was nothing i could do with it during that time and so  i had some some free time essentially it took over a part of the work that i would have to do as a  designer so that felt very much industry 4.0 where we have the computers take over boring parts or  unpleasant parts of our work and then after all the process of choosing a final design becomes  very transparent and and database because you have this very objective comparison of the different  designs and this was also reported by the interviewees from siemens so as an outlook  it would of course be important to also implement the other building shapes that  exist in the siemens construction excellence and then implement the whole process into  a BIM environment so for example to export from Revit the site outline into Dynamo then run the  optimization in refinery pick a favorite solution and export it from Dynamo directly with adaptive  families into Revit and have the final solution as a BIM model automatically generated in Revit  yes so that would be how to turn it into an actual software product for example  and then thank you for your attention and that was it  i hope that was good enough i had to go so fast over some of the things  15 minutes is really not a lot of time for six months of research  but i mean they have time to ask questions afterwards so  then i can explain some things in more detail maybe okay so that leaves one last thing to do  for tonight  and that is choose an outfit for tomorrow  so the first one is a very classic navy white combination with a blazer and a blouse  so this is what it would look like with the blazer on i think i would have enough  mobility to perform all kinds of movements and this is what it would look like without the blazer  if it's warm outside i don't know summer is already kind of over in munich  but maybe we'll get one more nice day of sunshine tomorrow and then the second option would be this  and blackened cream combination of pants and blouse that i also sported at  ayo london let me know what look you think i should wear tomorrow the most important thing  is that i don't forget  this year which is the printed out versions of my um actual thesis so if you're interested in  reading my thesis as well you will probably be able to do so because it will be published on the  university website and i will make sure to share a link on like my twitter or linkedin or wherever  you follow me so  one more task to do tomorrow with the presentation and then i will be done  with university and ready for the job market very exciting times very exciting  good morning today's the day i woke up this morning at four and couldn't go back to sleep  because i was so nervous and my head was just like going through every slide over and over again  um but i do feel ready now i feel confident about it i i think i've prepared well and  after all it is my thesis so when they ask questions like i will be able to answer them  um i chose the second outfit because when i looked at the footage i saw that the first  quite see-through um and also i think it will be warm enough today to go out without the jacket  okay so let's go  yeah
