 Whether you're a competitive cyclist, a speedboat racer or a pilot, you'll find it easier to get from A to B if your vehicle of choice has a streamlined shape.  This will help it reduce the restrictive forces caused by the air or water and allow you to reach a greater velocity.  It'll also help reduce fuel consumption.  If the cyclist adopts a streamlined or aerodynamic position, then there's a greater chance of winning the race and getting out of that rain a little quicker.
