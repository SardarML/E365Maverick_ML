[00:00:00 -> 00:00:14]  Hi, today we're going to talk about riveting. Riveting is used to join two or more pieces
[00:00:14 -> 00:00:21]  of metal together. Riveting is used in railings or furniture or decorative pieces or in this
[00:00:21 -> 00:00:25]  case we're going to show you how to rivet a pair of tongs together. You just need a
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:33]  few basic tools to do some riveting. One of them that you need is a rivet bucking tool.
[00:00:33 -> 00:00:39]  The bucking tool supports the head of the rivet. Your bucking tool should fit flush
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:45]  with the inside head of the rivet. That keeps the rivet head from deforming during the riveting
[00:00:45 -> 00:00:54]  process. The other tool you'll need is a rivet heading tool. This tool dresses up the forged
[00:00:54 -> 00:01:06]  end of the rivet. You also need a small ball-peen hammer for the riveting process. So the first
[00:01:06 -> 00:01:12]  step you need to do is drill your pieces that you're going to be riveting. Drill the holes
[00:01:12 -> 00:01:21]  the correct size. We're using a 5-16ths rivet so I drilled 5-16ths holes in my tongs. You don't
[00:01:21 -> 00:01:27]  want to get your hole too big and sloppy. You want a nice fit. The next thing you do after that
[00:01:27 -> 00:01:35]  is make sure your rivet is the right length. You need the correct amount of material sticking out
[00:01:35 -> 00:01:41]  of your tongs. We're using a 5-16ths rivet. The general rule of thumb is one and a half times
[00:01:41 -> 00:01:50]  the diameter of the rivet for the length of this material. So one and a half times 5-16ths is 15-30
[00:01:50 -> 00:01:59]  seconds. We're making it just a smidge longer so we're at about a half of an inch. Okay then we're
[00:01:59 -> 00:02:04]  going to need to heat this up to do the riveting process and you can heat this up locally with a
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:10]  torch or in our case we're going to be using the coal forge. Now before I stick it in the fire,
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:20]  I take my ball-peen hammer and I give this just a few hits. Mushroom this end a little bit that
[00:02:20 -> 00:02:24]  keeps the rivet from popping out. So now I want to go stick this in the forge so we're
[00:02:24 -> 00:02:29]  going to turn it over so we can heat the end of the rivet. So let's stick it in the forge.
[00:02:29 -> 00:02:39]  While that's heating up let's go over the riveting process. First we want to make sure
[00:02:39 -> 00:02:44]  our rivet is in the bucking tool and that our two pieces that we're riveting together are
[00:02:44 -> 00:02:51]  tight together. We don't want to have any gaps here. And we'll take our ball-peen hammer using
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:56]  the face of the hammer and we're going to use vertical blows. We're trying to upset this rivet
[00:02:56 -> 00:03:02]  making it shorter and bigger in diameter. When we get it about halfway we're going to switch to the
[00:03:02 -> 00:03:08]  ball-peen side of the hammer to the peen side and we're going to work around the outside edges.
[00:03:08 -> 00:03:16]  Around this outside edge and we're trying to shape it like a rivet. And then when we get down
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:23]  to about three-quarters of the way we're going to grab our heading tool and put that on there
[00:03:23 -> 00:03:25]  and this will dress up the end of that rivet.
