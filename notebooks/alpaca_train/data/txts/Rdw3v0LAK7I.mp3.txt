[00:00:00 -> 00:00:02]  Good nutrition is actually simpler than you think,
[00:00:02 -> 00:00:04]  and it doesn't require diets,
[00:00:04 -> 00:00:06]  it doesn't require supplements,
[00:00:06 -> 00:00:07]  it doesn't require keeping track
[00:00:07 -> 00:00:08]  of every nutrient you intake.
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:11]  So, first of all, I have been a fanatic
[00:00:11 -> 00:00:14]  of fitness and nutrition for over two decades,
[00:00:14 -> 00:00:18]  and from day one, I had a strong scientific interest.
[00:00:18 -> 00:00:19]  In my early days, there was already
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:22]  a lot of bro science going around,
[00:00:22 -> 00:00:25]  but it all exploded with social media and podcasts.
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:27]  It is definitely an exciting time now
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:29]  because there is a lot of interesting information
[00:00:29 -> 00:00:31]  and research going around on nutrition,
[00:00:31 -> 00:00:34]  on fitness, on holistic health, biohacking, et cetera.
[00:00:34 -> 00:00:36]  But consider this.
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:39]  Number one, there is too much information
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:42]  from thousands of influencers and pundits
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:43]  often contradicting each other.
[00:00:43 -> 00:00:45]  So, who is right?
[00:00:45 -> 00:00:47]  Number two, information is money,
[00:00:47 -> 00:00:49]  so most information out there is spread
[00:00:49 -> 00:00:51]  by businesses and advertisers,
[00:00:51 -> 00:00:54]  while common sense and simple solutions are left behind.
[00:00:54 -> 00:00:57]  Number three, it can be proven mathematically
[00:00:57 -> 00:00:59]  that most scientific studies out there are wrong
[00:00:59 -> 00:01:02]  due to the statistical methods employed.
[00:01:02 -> 00:01:04]  And I've actually made a video about this already.
[00:01:04 -> 00:01:07]  Number four, the best predictor of success
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:09]  of a daily regime is consistency.
[00:01:09 -> 00:01:11]  If you have to measure every nutrient
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:13]  and buy innumerable supplements,
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:15]  stay on top of all the information at all times,
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:19]  you will eventually be overwhelmed and give up.
[00:01:19 -> 00:01:22]  The result, countless people are eating processed food
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:24]  and trying to make up for it
[00:01:24 -> 00:01:26]  with even more processed supplements
[00:01:26 -> 00:01:29]  or changing diet every time they see a new post,
[00:01:29 -> 00:01:31]  all in the name of science
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:33]  and all in total illusion of control.
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:36]  And don't get me wrong, I am not dissing science.
[00:01:36 -> 00:01:37]  Science works.
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:39]  It makes planes fly, it cures disease.
[00:01:39 -> 00:01:42]  I dedicated the largest part of my life to science.
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:44]  But what people apply to their diet every day
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:45]  is not science.
[00:01:45 -> 00:01:49]  So, right now, I'm going to give you three simple rules
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:51]  to follow for optimum nutrition.
[00:01:51 -> 00:01:54]  I emphasize simple because while you can, of course,
[00:01:54 -> 00:01:56]  become an expert in the field
[00:01:56 -> 00:01:58]  and really fine tune your knowledge,
[00:01:58 -> 00:01:59]  we still have to face the problem
[00:01:59 -> 00:02:02]  that complexity cannot be sustained for too long.
[00:02:02 -> 00:02:04]  And so, at the end of the day,
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:06]  it becomes less effective than simplicity.
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:07]  With these simple rules,
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:10]  you can finally forget about stressing out over your diet
[00:02:10 -> 00:02:13]  and stop trying to piece together all the information
[00:02:13 -> 00:02:15]  on what is good and what is not good for you.
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:17]  Before I proceed, let me remind you
[00:02:17 -> 00:02:19]  that simple doesn't mean easy.
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:21]  You still need to put effort in your nutrition,
[00:02:21 -> 00:02:23]  just like you have to put effort in your workouts
[00:02:23 -> 00:02:24]  if you want results.
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:27]  But it all becomes easy with practice and habit.
[00:02:27 -> 00:02:29]  Rule number one, make it at home.
[00:02:29 -> 00:02:32]  First of all, when making your food at home from scratch,
[00:02:32 -> 00:02:34]  you know exactly what goes into it.
[00:02:34 -> 00:02:37]  And while anyone who knows anything knows that,
[00:02:37 -> 00:02:39]  it is still so overlooked.
[00:02:39 -> 00:02:41]  When you buy packaged food, take out food,
[00:02:41 -> 00:02:43]  or even eat out all the time,
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:45]  you do not know what goes into it.
[00:02:45 -> 00:02:47]  And given that the purpose of all these products
[00:02:47 -> 00:02:50]  is to make money, not to keep you healthy,
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:53]  you're eating excessive sugars, unhealthy fats,
[00:02:53 -> 00:02:54]  preservatives, and other things
[00:02:54 -> 00:02:57]  that are extremely bad for you, day after day.
[00:02:57 -> 00:03:00]  And if you think, oh, but it says healthy on the packet,
[00:03:00 -> 00:03:03]  well, why are you even holding a packet in your hand?
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:07]  If it is packaged and has more than three ingredients,
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:08]  then put it down.
[00:03:08 -> 00:03:12]  And I know you know this, but I can hear somebody say,
[00:03:12 -> 00:03:13]  oh, but I don't know how to cook,
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:15]  I don't have time to cook, et cetera.
[00:03:15 -> 00:03:18]  Well, it is about time you learn or find the time
[00:03:18 -> 00:03:22]  because otherwise it's like those people who are saying,
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:24]  I wanna be fit, but I don't know how to exercise
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:26]  or I don't have time.
[00:03:26 -> 00:03:30]  Well, that just simply means you don't really want to be fit.
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:32]  Same with cooking.
[00:03:32 -> 00:03:34]  It is part of the process of being healthy
[00:03:34 -> 00:03:35]  and having a good life.
[00:03:35 -> 00:03:38]  And in fact, it is a rewarding and fulfilling activity
[00:03:38 -> 00:03:40]  once you start to see improvements
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:42]  and you won't be able to go back.
[00:03:42 -> 00:03:44]  I make all my food at home.
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:47]  And when I eat out, not only it tastes bad to me,
[00:03:47 -> 00:03:51]  I also feel the unhealthiness, so to speak.
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:54]  Plus, you save a bunch of money making food at home
[00:03:54 -> 00:03:57]  and your friends will appreciate your cooking skills.
[00:03:57 -> 00:03:58]  Don't worry, I will make more videos
[00:03:58 -> 00:03:59]  on how to get organized
[00:03:59 -> 00:04:02]  so you can easily make your food at home every day.
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:05]  Now, you decided to cook at home.
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:07]  What do you cook to make sure
[00:04:07 -> 00:04:09]  you get all the nutrients you need?
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:13]  And here comes rule number two, keep it traditional.
[00:04:13 -> 00:04:14]  I was lucky to grow up in Italy
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:16]  because it has such a strong food culture.
[00:04:16 -> 00:04:19]  This really helped me uncover this fundamental truth.
[00:04:19 -> 00:04:22]  Traditional food is the best food for you.
[00:04:22 -> 00:04:25]  First of all, it has been tried and tested over centuries,
[00:04:25 -> 00:04:26]  if not millennia.
[00:04:26 -> 00:04:30]  While most modern diets are made from patched up information,
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:32]  traditional food has been proven to be good for us
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:34]  empirically in real life.
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:36]  It has evolved over time.
[00:04:36 -> 00:04:39]  It's simple, culture tended to eat healthier,
[00:04:39 -> 00:04:41]  were fitter, survive longer, reproduce more
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:43]  and passed on the recipes.
[00:04:43 -> 00:04:46]  It is no coincidence that Italy and Japan,
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:50]  two countries with incredibly established food traditions,
[00:04:50 -> 00:04:52]  have the lowest rates of obesity in the world.
[00:04:52 -> 00:04:54]  But all countries with a long enough history
[00:04:54 -> 00:04:56]  will provide you with countless recipes
[00:04:56 -> 00:04:58]  for tasty and healthy food.
[00:04:58 -> 00:05:00]  The traditional preparations from fresh ingredients
[00:05:00 -> 00:05:02]  deliver the most nutrients.
[00:05:02 -> 00:05:03]  Let me give you some examples.
[00:05:03 -> 00:05:06]  Bone broth is a good example
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:09]  because it is rich in collagen and amino acids
[00:05:09 -> 00:05:13]  which are missing from our modern diets of lean meat.
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:16]  Fermented foods like kimchi, sauerkraut
[00:05:16 -> 00:05:18]  and kefir are rich in probiotics
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:21]  which improve our gut health and boost the immune system.
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:24]  Another example, sourdough bread,
[00:05:24 -> 00:05:28]  real sourdough bread like the one I make myself at home.
[00:05:28 -> 00:05:31]  It helps digestion and nutrient absorption
[00:05:31 -> 00:05:35]  while having lower glycemic index than regular bread.
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:36]  And the list goes on.
[00:05:36 -> 00:05:38]  So by eating traditional,
[00:05:38 -> 00:05:39]  you can finally be sure you're getting
[00:05:39 -> 00:05:41]  all the nutrients you need
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:43]  and you can stop buying all those supplements
[00:05:43 -> 00:05:45]  or following ridiculous diets.
[00:05:45 -> 00:05:47]  Rule number three, listen to your body.
[00:05:47 -> 00:05:50]  Now, here comes another important part
[00:05:50 -> 00:05:52]  that sounds like woo, but it isn't.
[00:05:52 -> 00:05:55]  There are general ways in which we are all the same
[00:05:55 -> 00:05:58]  but there are also small variations between each individual
[00:05:58 -> 00:06:00]  that while small on the statistical scale
[00:06:00 -> 00:06:03]  are very large in our own everyday life.
[00:06:03 -> 00:06:07]  For example, the glycemic index of each food
[00:06:07 -> 00:06:08]  is a ballpark figure,
[00:06:08 -> 00:06:10]  but each food has slightly different effects
[00:06:10 -> 00:06:11]  on different people.
[00:06:11 -> 00:06:13]  So how to tell what is good
[00:06:13 -> 00:06:15]  without having regular blood work done
[00:06:15 -> 00:06:17]  or without wearing expensive monitors?
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:20]  This is where listening to your body comes in.
[00:06:20 -> 00:06:22]  Your body has a way to tell you everything.
[00:06:22 -> 00:06:24]  There is a part of the brain called the insula
[00:06:24 -> 00:06:27]  which tells your conscious self the state of your body.
[00:06:27 -> 00:06:30]  But more simply, think of your appetite,
[00:06:30 -> 00:06:32]  your thirst, cravings, the quality of your moods,
[00:06:32 -> 00:06:34]  your energy levels, your focus.
[00:06:34 -> 00:06:36]  But you can also observe things externally
[00:06:36 -> 00:06:38]  such as your skin quality, your sleep,
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:41]  your breath, your physical performance.
[00:06:41 -> 00:06:43]  If you're not exercising and eating well,
[00:06:43 -> 00:06:45]  some of these things will be off.
[00:06:45 -> 00:06:47]  But how do you listen to your body?
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:50]  Simply start by exercising regularly
[00:06:50 -> 00:06:52]  and making traditional food at home.
[00:06:52 -> 00:06:54]  You will see improvements in everything.
[00:06:54 -> 00:06:57]  Plus, you will discover something else.
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:00]  Your cravings will resume working as they should.
[00:07:00 -> 00:07:01]  When you are healthy,
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:03]  if you crave something, it means you need it.
[00:07:03 -> 00:07:06]  When you had enough food, you feel full.
[00:07:06 -> 00:07:08]  When you're not hungry, you don't need to eat.
[00:07:08 -> 00:07:10]  Your feedback mechanisms are working.
[00:07:10 -> 00:07:13]  When you're sedentary and eat processed foods,
[00:07:13 -> 00:07:14]  your cravings are misdirected.
[00:07:14 -> 00:07:16]  This is such an important hack
[00:07:16 -> 00:07:19]  because it can help you adjust what to eat
[00:07:19 -> 00:07:21]  from the large selection of traditional foods
[00:07:21 -> 00:07:23]  and when to eat them.
[00:07:23 -> 00:07:25]  And this without ever having to track
[00:07:25 -> 00:07:28]  and monitor every nutrient or how much you should eat.
[00:07:28 -> 00:07:30]  Your body will tell you everything
[00:07:30 -> 00:07:32]  if you only learn how to listen.
[00:07:32 -> 00:07:34]  And you will also reduce stress in your life,
[00:07:34 -> 00:07:37]  the stress of having to think about every little nutrient.
[00:07:37 -> 00:07:39]  One final piece of advice
[00:07:39 -> 00:07:41]  which could almost be a bonus rule.
[00:07:41 -> 00:07:43]  Keep the variety going.
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:45]  It is easy to become complacent
[00:07:45 -> 00:07:47]  and always cook the same meals,
[00:07:47 -> 00:07:48]  but that would have the same effect
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:51]  as keep repeating the same routines at the gym.
[00:07:51 -> 00:07:55]  You will eventually plateau and probably injure yourself.
[00:07:55 -> 00:07:56]  With food, it is the same.
[00:07:56 -> 00:08:00]  The variety ensures you're getting all you need
[00:08:00 -> 00:08:03]  and will also keep your feedback mechanisms healthy.
[00:08:03 -> 00:08:05]  After all, in order to have different cravings,
[00:08:05 -> 00:08:07]  you need to be exposed to different foods.
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:09]  You can't listen to your body
[00:08:09 -> 00:08:11]  if you only ever have the same things.
[00:08:11 -> 00:08:12]  I hope this helped.
