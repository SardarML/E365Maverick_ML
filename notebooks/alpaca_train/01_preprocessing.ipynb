So this is actually a favorite area of the examiner. So we need to prepare this topic completely and if you know this topic- emergence of sociology- you can easily understand the other topics like scope of sociology, sociology and other sciences, the comparison and some of the other topics also which are related to this particular topic. So we need to understand emergence of sociology. Now what are the questions you can get from this? Let's start from the questions. The first question itself: you will be getting a short note: emergence of sociology. So you can get a short note like 10 marker- emergence of sociology directly. Or the second way in which they will ask you this question is impact of modernity on the emergence of sociology. So impact of modernity and social changes and social changes on the emergence of sociology. So this is going to be another way in which they can ask you a question from the same topic: impact of modernity. So if you observe here, two new words are involved: modernity and social changes. So when you talk about emergence of sociology in this particular question, you need to talk about modernity and social change. Or if simply they are asking about emergence of sociology, then also you need to discuss about modernity and the social changes associated with modernity. So it's actually you need to talk about modernity, so you need to understand what you mean by modernity and you need to see what are the changes caused by modernity and why these changes led to the emergence of sociology. So this is what we are going to answer. So this is how your answer will look like. So we need to talk about modernity, the changes caused by modernity and the context of emergence of sociology, and how sociology prospered after the emergence. What is the context for the development of sociology? So this is how your answer we are going to prepare. Or another way in which they can ask you a question is how modernity and social changes led to the emergence of sociology. It's the same question, same as the approach. So we are going to discuss about this now. The other way in which they can ask you a long question, like a 20 marker or a 15 marker, is actually they give you a statement just like this: sociology. Okay, the statement will be something like this: sociology emerged as a response to challenges posed before modernity- comment, critically analyze, discuss, etc. Okay, sociology emerged in response to challenges posed by modernity in europe. Okay, now the question can be discussed. Okay, it can be comment, it can be critically analyzed or whatever it is. We are going to answer these. Okay. So it depends on the question: whether it is comment or discuss or critically analyze. The pattern of answer or the structure of the answer will vary, okay, so, for example, if the question is about critically analyze, okay. So then what you need to do, what you need to do is the structure will be: look like this: so in the question they're talking about modernity in europe and challenges posed by modernity, right? So what we need to discuss is: what was the situation in europe before modernity? And we will understand it as dark ages. Okay, so you need to talk about the previous situation- dark ages. We are going to discuss about this. Then we will talk about modernity. What do you mean by modernity? We call this period as renaissance period. Okay, we'll come to that. Or the age of enlightenment. Then we need to see the challenges posed by modernity. That means impact of modernity or the social changes which caused by modernity. So we will talk about changes or impacts and we will tell the changes which led to the emergence of sociology. Okay, so, like this. Then we will see the other factors also. Okay, other factors also. So that's how you will write the answer. Now we need to solve all these aspects now. So the question can be like this also. So they will ask you simply: emergence of sociology. They can ask you: sociology emerged as a response to challenges posed before modernity, comment, discuss, critically, analyze, etc. Or how modernity and associated social changes led to the emergence of sociology. Like this also. They can ask you: question: okay, whatever it is, what we are going to do is we need to talk about modernity? Okay, so we need to talk about modernity now, to understand modernity better, we should talk about the dark age. That means so modernity is actually an ideology and it actually happened during renaissance period or age of enlightenment. I'm coming to all these things. I'm just giving you a broad structure of what we are going to discuss. So first we need to discuss about age of enlightenment. Now how to answer this question. This discussion is confined in examination point of view. So, basically, you need to discuss about modernity, right? So if you need to discuss about modernity, this is actually during the period of age of enlightenment, or this period is actually called as renaissance period. Okay, i'll be coming to all these things: renaissance period or age of enlightenment, age of enlightenment. So when we discuss about modernity, we have to discuss about renaissance or age of enlightenment. So obviously we need to give a brief introduction about the dark ages before enlightenment. What happened, what was the situation? So we call it as dark ages. So we have to talk about dark ages first. Then we will see the age of enlightenment, age of enlightenment, and then we talk about modernity. Okay, then we talk about changes caused by modernity and then we talk about emergence of sociology, and then we also talk about the thinkers. Okay, the thinkers who increased the scope of the subject, or sociology. Okay. So these are the aspects that we need to cover. So let me give you a quick idea of the discussion. So first we need to discuss about dark ages, then we talk about renaissance period, then we talk about the various elements of this renaissance period, so various revolutions on different aspects, like scientific revolution, intellectual revolution, commercial revolution, etc. And together. All this together we call as modernity. Okay, then this modernity led to a lot of changes, so you can see profound social changes and this led to emergence of sociology. Okay, so this is our discussion. Now let's start off with dark ages. Just an introduction. You don't want to talk too much about dark ages. Basically, we need to talk about modernity. So when we discuss about modernity, we call it as renaissance period or we can understand it as age of enlightenment. The reason is there are a lot of changes happened.\",\n",

Now, medieval europe, when we talk about, underwent huge transformation in terms of scientific, commercial and intellectual revolution. Intellectual revolution- okay.

All this together we call as modernity. Okay, then this modernity led to a lot of changes, so you can see profound social changes and this led to emergence of sociology. Okay, so this is our discussion. Now let's start off with dark ages. Just an introduction. You don't want to talk too much about dark ages. Basically, we need to talk about modernity. So when we discuss about modernity, we call it as renaissance period or we can understand it as age of enlightenment. The reason is there are a lot of changes happened. Okay, there are a lot of changes happened in terms of scientific revolution, intellectual revolution, commercial revolution, etc. So this period is called as age of enlightenment. But what was the time or what was the period before this? That period was known as the european society. Before age of enlightenment was known as dark ages. Okay, so it is based on agricultural feudal estate system and the society was rooted in a very orthodox religious view. Okay, so everything is based on religion and very orthodox society and the church was very important. Church and priest was the key players, and they have given excessive reliance to religion, excessive reliance on religion and its beliefs. Okay, so, religion and its beliefs. On the other side, if you talk about political aristocracy. They are engaged in wars- okay. So political aristocracy, they are engaged in wars, unmindful of the plight of the people. They were not thinking about what the people are interested in, or they are not concerned about the people or the public. They are engaged in wars- okay, to expand their territory and all. So this is what you need to write about dark age: one or two sentences, not more than that. European society before the age of enlightenment was based on agricultural estate system, feudal estate system- okay, and this period was known as dark ages. The church and the priest: they gave excessive reliance on religion and its beliefs- okay. And the political aristocracy: they are engaged in wars, unmindful of the plight of the people- okay, this period is known as dark ages, so that you can call before 13th century or before 12th century, etc. That the time of dark ages. Now, medieval europe, when we talk about, underwent huge transformation in terms of scientific, commercial and intellectual revolution. Intellectual revolution- okay. So we can see a lot of changes: scientific, commercial and intellectual spheres- and these dimensions, these changes were gradually accumulating and you can see huge transformation during 15th to 18th centuries. Okay, so these revolutions have brought profound changes in the society. Okay. Now these revolutions are collectively called as age of enlightenment, age of enlightenment or the renaissance period. Okay, so, age of enlightenment or renaissance period. So first is dark age, then age of enlightenment or renaissance period. So when we talk about age of enlightenment, we are talking about scientific, intellectual and commercial revolution. So we can call this as modernity, so this as modernity, the changes- okay, that you can understand basically as modernity. Now we need to see various dimensions of modernity. So when we talk about modernity, let's discuss about various dimensions of modernity. Or where you saw the changes, drastic changes. The first one we can talk about the intellectual dimension. Okay, intellectual dimension. So the changes are basically now more than religion. There is faith in science. Okay, faith in science. Now the intellectual started. Logical inquiry based on evidence and reason rather than the mere beliefs. Okay, so, logical inquiry based on evidence and reason, evidence and reason rather than mere belief. Okay, so one dimension of modernity you can write as intellectual dimension. So faith in science is more than religion. Now, logical inquiry based on evidence and reason. So you can see the attendance in church and all is reduced, because earlier everything was explained through religion and religious beliefs, but now science started explaining everything. So the reliance on the religion actually came down. So this is actually the beginning of secularism. We'll come to that, okay. Now the second dimension.\",\n",

So we will talk about changes or impacts and we will tell the changes which led to the emergence of sociology. Okay, so, like this. Then we will see the other factors also. Okay, other factors also. So that's how you will write the answer. Now we need to solve all these aspects now. So the question can be like this also. So they will ask you simply: emergence of sociology. They can ask you: sociology emerged as a response to challenges posed before modernity, comment, discuss, critically, analyze, etc. Or how modernity and associated social changes led to the emergence of sociology. Like this also. They can ask you: question: okay, whatever it is, what we are going to do is we need to talk about modernity? Okay, so we need to talk about modernity now, to understand modernity better, we should talk about the dark age. That means so modernity is actually an ideology and it actually happened during renaissance period or age of enlightenment. I'm coming to all these things. I'm just giving you a broad structure of what we are going to discuss. So first we need to discuss about age of enlightenment. Now how to answer this question. This discussion is confined in examination point of view. So, basically, you need to discuss about modernity, right? So if you need to discuss about modernity, this is actually during the period of age of enlightenment, or this period is actually called as renaissance period. Okay, i'll be coming to all these things: renaissance period or age of enlightenment, age of enlightenment. So when we discuss about modernity, we have to discuss about renaissance or age of enlightenment. So obviously we need to give a brief introduction about the dark ages before enlightenment. What happened, what was the situation? So we call it as dark ages. So we have to talk about dark ages first. Then we will see the age of enlightenment, age of enlightenment, and then we talk about modernity. Okay, then we talk about changes caused by modernity and then we talk about emergence of sociology, and then we also talk about the thinkers. Okay, the thinkers who increased the scope of the subject, or sociology. Okay. So these are the aspects that we need to cover. So let me give you a quick idea of the discussion.

So first we need to discuss about dark ages, then we talk about renaissance period, then we talk about the various elements of this renaissance period, so various revolutions on different aspects, like scientific revolution, intellectual revolution, commercial revolution, etc. And together. All this together we call as modernity. Okay, then this modernity led to a lot of changes, so you can see profound social changes and this led to emergence of sociology. Okay, so this is our discussion. Now let's start off with dark ages. Just an introduction. You don't want to talk too much about dark ages. Basically, we need to talk about modernity. So when we discuss about modernity, we call it as renaissance period or we can understand it as age of enlightenment. The reason is there are a lot of changes happened. Okay, there are a lot of changes happened in terms of scientific revolution, intellectual revolution, commercial revolution, etc. So this period is called as age of enlightenment. But what was the time or what was the period before this? That period was known as the european society. Before age of enlightenment was known as dark ages. Okay, so it is based on agricultural feudal estate system and the society was rooted in a very orthodox religious view. Okay, so everything is based on religion and very orthodox society and the church was very important. Church and priest was the key players, and they have given excessive reliance to religion, excessive reliance on religion and its beliefs. Okay, so, religion and its beliefs. On the other side, if you talk about political aristocracy. They are engaged in wars- okay. So political aristocracy, they are engaged in wars, unmindful of the plight of the people. They were not thinking about what the people are interested in, or they are not concerned about the people or the public. They are engaged in wars- okay, to expand their territory and all. So this is what you need to write about dark age: one or two sentences, not more than that. European society before the age of enlightenment was based on agricultural estate system, feudal estate system- okay, and this period was known as dark ages. The church and the priest: they gave excessive reliance on religion and its beliefs- okay. And the political aristocracy: they are engaged in wars, unmindful of the plight of the people- okay, this period is known as dark ages, so that you can call before 13th century or before 12th century, etc. That the time of dark ages. Now, medieval europe, when we talk about, underwent huge transformation in terms of scientific, commercial and intellectual revolution. Intellectual revolution- okay. So we can see a lot of changes: scientific, commercial and intellectual spheres- and these dimensions, these changes were gradually accumulating and you can see huge transformation during 15th to 18th centuries. Okay, so these revolutions have brought profound changes in the society. Okay. Now these revolutions are collectively called as age of enlightenment, age of enlightenment or the renaissance period. Okay, so, age of enlightenment or renaissance period. So first is dark age, then age of enlightenment or renaissance period. So when we talk about age of enlightenment, we are talking about scientific, intellectual and commercial revolution. So we can call this as modernity, so this as modernity, the changes- okay, that you can understand basically as modernity. Now we need to see various dimensions of modernity. So when we talk about modernity, let's discuss about various dimensions of modernity. Or where you saw the changes, drastic changes. The first one we can talk about the intellectual dimension. Okay, intellectual dimension. So the changes are basically now more than religion. There is faith in science. Okay, faith in science. Now the intellectual started. Logical inquiry based on evidence and reason rather than the mere beliefs. Okay, so, logical inquiry based on evidence and reason, evidence and reason rather than mere belief. Okay, so one dimension of modernity you can write as intellectual dimension. So faith in science is more than religion. Now, logical inquiry based on evidence and reason. So you can see the attendance in church and all is reduced, because earlier everything was explained through religion and religious beliefs, but now science started explaining everything. So the reliance on the religion actually came down. So this is actually the beginning of secularism. We'll come to that, okay. Now the second dimension. You can understand as economic, various changes in economic dimension, what all things happen. The rational organization of production. Now the production is rationalized, okay, so you can write: rational organization of production. Rational organization of production. Then you can see: use of technology, industrial revolution, okay, use of technology. See, when we talk about modernity, one of the most important aspect you need to talk about is actually industrial revolution, okay. So i told you already, age of enlightenment or renaissance period is in terms of commercial, intellectual and scientific revolution. In that scientific and commercial revolution we already understood, right, we already spoke about, in that actually industrial revolution is automatically implied. Okay, so, use of technology. Then rise of new companies. You can write here: rise of new companies, new management practices. Earlier in traditional society, the joint family used to take care of all these things, but now new management practices, etc. New management practices, expansion in trade. So these are the changes that you can see in economic dimension. So when we talk about modernity, two dimensions, one is intellectual and the other is economic. Now let's see what are the changes you can see in political dimension, or the dimension of modernity on the political side. Okay, so you can see the change from authoritarian to democratic system. Okay, so you can write here: change from authoritarian to representative form. Or you can write it as democracy: okay, democracy, especially after french revolution, and all okay. So we will come to this french revolution i will discuss. Then you can write emphasis on welfare of people. Welfare of people. So when we discuss about dark ages, i told you political aristocracy was engaged in wars, unmindful of the plight of the people. Now they started thinking about the people also. So they are considering the welfare of the public.\",\n",

So they are considering the welfare of the public. Okay, now let's look at one more dimension, that is, social dimension. Okay, so, economic, political, social and intellectual. Let's look at the social dimension. What are the changes modernity brought? Okay, now you can see emergence of industrial society. Emergence of industrial society, you can see emergence of modern education, not completely based on religion, right. Then you can see emergence of secularism, one of the most important dimension when we discuss about social side. Okay, nuclear families emerged because, see, industrialization means earlier feudal system. Right, people are tied on land. But industrialization means industries, means you need free labor. So people started migrating, so nuclear families started coming right. So these are the four dimensions when we talk about modernity- social, economic, political and intellectual- i hope this is clear for all of you. Now, if you observe, you can see the macro changes and micro changes right because of modernity.\",\n",

Rise of liberal democracy- now, what happened with that? Is the micro change, okay, that you can write. I am coming to that anyway. Then what else you can write under macro change? You can obviously write rise of middle class, rise of- because there are a lot of changes in economic setup. So rise of middle class, okay. And emergence of new intellectualism. So these are the macro changes you can write. When you write an answer for sociology, you need to always write macro, micro difference. Macro changes are the broad changes that you can visualize in the society. Micro change is the small, small minute things. Okay, within macro. Okay. So these are the macro changes that you can visualize because of modernity.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"So this is what you need to write about dark age: one or two sentences, not more than that. European society before the age of enlightenment was based on agricultural estate system, feudal estate system- okay, and this period was known as dark ages. The church and the priest: they gave excessive reliance on religion and its beliefs- okay. And the political aristocracy: they are engaged in wars, unmindful of the plight of the people- okay, this period is known as dark ages, so that you can call before 13th century or before 12th century, etc. That the time of dark ages. Now, medieval europe, when we talk about, underwent huge transformation in terms of scientific, commercial and intellectual revolution. Intellectual revolution- okay. So we can see a lot of changes: scientific, commercial and intellectual spheres- and these dimensions, these changes were gradually accumulating and you can see huge transformation during 15th to 18th centuries. Okay, so these revolutions have brought profound changes in the society. Okay. Now these revolutions are collectively called as age of enlightenment, age of enlightenment or the renaissance period. Okay, so, age of enlightenment or renaissance period. So first is dark age, then age of enlightenment or renaissance period. So when we talk about age of enlightenment, we are talking about scientific, intellectual and commercial revolution. So we can call this as modernity, so this as modernity, the changes- okay, that you can understand basically as modernity. Now we need to see various dimensions of modernity. So when we talk about modernity, let's discuss about various dimensions of modernity. Or where you saw the changes, drastic changes. The first one we can talk about the intellectual dimension. Okay, intellectual dimension. So the changes are basically now more than religion. There is faith in science. Okay, faith in science. Now the intellectual started. Logical inquiry based on evidence and reason rather than the mere beliefs. Okay, so, logical inquiry based on evidence and reason, evidence and reason rather than mere belief. Okay, so one dimension of modernity you can write as intellectual dimension. So faith in science is more than religion. Now, logical inquiry based on evidence and reason. So you can see the attendance in church and all is reduced, because earlier everything was explained through religion and religious beliefs, but now science started explaining everything. So the reliance on the religion actually came down. So this is actually the beginning of secularism. We'll come to that, okay. Now the second dimension. You can understand as economic, various changes in economic dimension, what all things happen. The rational organization of production. Now the production is rationalized, okay, so you can write: rational organization of production. Rational organization of production. Then you can see: use of technology, industrial revolution, okay, use of technology. See, when we talk about modernity, one of the most important aspect you need to talk about is actually industrial revolution, okay. So i told you already, age of enlightenment or renaissance period is in terms of commercial, intellectual and scientific revolution. In that scientific and commercial revolution we already understood, right, we already spoke about, in that actually industrial revolution is automatically implied. Okay, so, use of technology. Then rise of new companies. You can write here: rise of new companies, new management practices. Earlier in traditional society, the joint family used to take care of all these things, but now new management practices, etc. New management practices, expansion in trade. So these are the changes that you can see in economic dimension. So when we talk about modernity, two dimensions, one is intellectual and the other is economic. Now let's see what are the changes you can see in political dimension, or the dimension of modernity on the political side. Okay, so you can see the change from authoritarian to democratic system. Okay, so you can write here: change from authoritarian to representative form. Or you can write it as democracy: okay, democracy, especially after french revolution, and all okay. So we will come to this french revolution i will discuss. Then you can write emphasis on welfare of people. Welfare of people. So when we discuss about dark ages, i told you political aristocracy was engaged in wars, unmindful of the plight of the people. Now they started thinking about the people also. So they are considering the welfare of the public. Okay, now let's look at one more dimension, that is, social dimension. Okay, so, economic, political, social and intellectual. Let's look at the social dimension. What are the changes modernity brought? Okay, now you can see emergence of industrial society. Emergence of industrial society, you can see emergence of modern education, not completely based on religion, right. Then you can see emergence of secularism, one of the most important dimension when we discuss about social side. Okay, nuclear families emerged because, see, industrialization means earlier feudal system. Right, people are tied on land. But industrialization means industries, means you need free labor. So people started migrating, so nuclear families started coming right. So these are the four dimensions when we talk about modernity- social, economic, political and intellectual- i hope this is clear for all of you. Now, if you observe, you can see the macro changes and micro changes right because of modernity. So when we talk about macro changes, what are the macro changes you can see? You can see emergence of industrial society, right. So emergence of industrial society. Now, within this you can see a lot of micro changes. There are a lot of impact for emergence of industrial society. See this: emergence of nuclear families, new types of crimes, emergence of slum, etc. As a result of industrial society. So those things you will write under micro. Okay. So macro change you will understand as industrial society. Then another macro change you can write as: rise of liberal democracy. Rise of liberal democracy- now, what happened with that? Is the micro change, okay, that you can write. I am coming to that anyway. Then what else you can write under macro change? You can obviously write rise of middle class, rise of- because there are a lot of changes in economic setup. So rise of middle class, okay. And emergence of new intellectualism. So these are the macro changes you can write. When you write an answer for sociology, you need to always write macro, micro difference. Macro changes are the broad changes that you can visualize in the society. Micro change is the small, small minute things. Okay, within macro. Okay. So these are the macro changes that you can visualize because of modernity. Now, if you take one by one out of this, what do you think? These changes are required or not? See, these changes are highly desirable and appreciated in the beginning because european society earlier was based on. You know already that we discussed about dark ages. Right now, these changes are highly desirable.\",\n",

You can see emergence of industrial society, right. So emergence of industrial society. Now, within this you can see a lot of micro changes. There are a lot of impact for emergence of industrial society. See this: emergence of nuclear families, new types of crimes, emergence of slum, etc. As a result of industrial society. So those things you will write under micro. Okay. So macro change you will understand as industrial society. Then another macro change you can write as: rise of liberal democracy. Rise of liberal democracy- now, what happened with that? Is the micro change, okay, that you can write. I am coming to that anyway. Then what else you can write under macro change? You can obviously write rise of middle class, rise of- because there are a lot of changes in economic setup. So rise of middle class, okay. And emergence of new intellectualism. So these are the macro changes you can write. When you write an answer for sociology, you need to always write macro, micro difference. Macro changes are the broad changes that you can visualize in the society. Micro change is the small, small minute things. Okay, within macro. Okay. So these are the macro changes that you can visualize because of modernity. Now, if you take one by one out of this, what do you think? These changes are required or not? See, these changes are highly desirable and appreciated in the beginning because european society earlier was based on. You know already that we discussed about dark ages. Right now, these changes are highly desirable. But what happened is, with time, these changes caused a lot of challenges before modernity, although these things are expected and desirable. But it also posed a lot of challenges before modernity. So we need to see what are the challenges, and that challenges led to emergence of sociology. See, the process of industrialization was not very smooth. It came with a lot of challenges, like workers are working with very less wages, and, okay, you can write: workers, less wages and inhuman working condition, inhuman working condition. Okay, one of the most important problem faced by workers: very low wage, inhuman working condition, number of hours of working is more, no protections, etc. Okay, so then you can. You have already said the salaries are less and working condition. Then you can see emergence of nuclear families. That also created problem, like it led to split of joint families- okay. Then a lot of migration- okay, that led to nuclear families. And you can see a lot of instances of domestic violence. Okay, you can see a lot of instances of domestic violence. Now, more and more people started migrating to the industrial area.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"Okay, so, age of enlightenment or renaissance period. So first is dark age, then age of enlightenment or renaissance period. So when we talk about age of enlightenment, we are talking about scientific, intellectual and commercial revolution. So we can call this as modernity, so this as modernity, the changes- okay, that you can understand basically as modernity. Now we need to see various dimensions of modernity. So when we talk about modernity, let's discuss about various dimensions of modernity. Or where you saw the changes, drastic changes. The first one we can talk about the intellectual dimension. Okay, intellectual dimension. So the changes are basically now more than religion. There is faith in science. Okay, faith in science. Now the intellectual started. Logical inquiry based on evidence and reason rather than the mere beliefs. Okay, so, logical inquiry based on evidence and reason, evidence and reason rather than mere belief. Okay, so one dimension of modernity you can write as intellectual dimension. So faith in science is more than religion. Now, logical inquiry based on evidence and reason. So you can see the attendance in church and all is reduced, because earlier everything was explained through religion and religious beliefs, but now science started explaining everything. So the reliance on the religion actually came down. So this is actually the beginning of secularism. We'll come to that, okay. Now the second dimension. You can understand as economic, various changes in economic dimension, what all things happen. The rational organization of production. Now the production is rationalized, okay, so you can write: rational organization of production. Rational organization of production. Then you can see: use of technology, industrial revolution, okay, use of technology. See, when we talk about modernity, one of the most important aspect you need to talk about is actually industrial revolution, okay. So i told you already, age of enlightenment or renaissance period is in terms of commercial, intellectual and scientific revolution. In that scientific and commercial revolution we already understood, right, we already spoke about, in that actually industrial revolution is automatically implied. Okay, so, use of technology. Then rise of new companies. You can write here: rise of new companies, new management practices. Earlier in traditional society, the joint family used to take care of all these things, but now new management practices, etc. New management practices, expansion in trade. So these are the changes that you can see in economic dimension. So when we talk about modernity, two dimensions, one is intellectual and the other is economic. Now let's see what are the changes you can see in political dimension, or the dimension of modernity on the political side. Okay, so you can see the change from authoritarian to democratic system. Okay, so you can write here: change from authoritarian to representative form. Or you can write it as democracy: okay, democracy, especially after french revolution, and all okay. So we will come to this french revolution i will discuss. Then you can write emphasis on welfare of people. Welfare of people. So when we discuss about dark ages, i told you political aristocracy was engaged in wars, unmindful of the plight of the people. Now they started thinking about the people also. So they are considering the welfare of the public. Okay, now let's look at one more dimension, that is, social dimension. Okay, so, economic, political, social and intellectual. Let's look at the social dimension. What are the changes modernity brought? Okay, now you can see emergence of industrial society. Emergence of industrial society, you can see emergence of modern education, not completely based on religion, right. Then you can see emergence of secularism, one of the most important dimension when we discuss about social side. Okay, nuclear families emerged because, see, industrialization means earlier feudal system. Right, people are tied on land. But industrialization means industries, means you need free labor. So people started migrating, so nuclear families started coming right. So these are the four dimensions when we talk about modernity- social, economic, political and intellectual- i hope this is clear for all of you. Now, if you observe, you can see the macro changes and micro changes right because of modernity. So when we talk about macro changes, what are the macro changes you can see?

So when we discuss about dark ages, i told you political aristocracy was engaged in wars, unmindful of the plight of the people. Now they started thinking about the people also. So they are considering the welfare of the public. Okay, now let's look at one more dimension, that is, social dimension. Okay, so, economic, political, social and intellectual. Let's look at the social dimension. What are the changes modernity brought? Okay, now you can see emergence of industrial society. Emergence of industrial society, you can see emergence of modern education, not completely based on religion, right. Then you can see emergence of secularism, one of the most important dimension when we discuss about social side. Okay, nuclear families emerged because, see, industrialization means earlier feudal system. Right, people are tied on land. But industrialization means industries, means you need free labor. So people started migrating, so nuclear families started coming right. So these are the four dimensions when we talk about modernity- social, economic, political and intellectual- i hope this is clear for all of you. Now, if you observe, you can see the macro changes and micro changes right because of modernity. So when we talk about macro changes, what are the macro changes you can see? You can see emergence of industrial society, right. So emergence of industrial society. Now, within this you can see a lot of micro changes. There are a lot of impact for emergence of industrial society. See this: emergence of nuclear families, new types of crimes, emergence of slum, etc. As a result of industrial society. So those things you will write under micro. Okay. So macro change you will understand as industrial society. Then another macro change you can write as: rise of liberal democracy. Rise of liberal democracy- now, what happened with that? Is the micro change, okay, that you can write. I am coming to that anyway. Then what else you can write under macro change? You can obviously write rise of middle class, rise of- because there are a lot of changes in economic setup. So rise of middle class, okay. And emergence of new intellectualism. So these are the macro changes you can write. When you write an answer for sociology, you need to always write macro, micro difference. Macro changes are the broad changes that you can visualize in the society. Micro change is the small, small minute things. Okay, within macro. Okay. So these are the macro changes that you can visualize because of modernity. Now, if you take one by one out of this, what do you think? These changes are required or not? See, these changes are highly desirable and appreciated in the beginning because european society earlier was based on. You know already that we discussed about dark ages. Right now, these changes are highly desirable. But what happened is, with time, these changes caused a lot of challenges before modernity, although these things are expected and desirable. But it also posed a lot of challenges before modernity. So we need to see what are the challenges, and that challenges led to emergence of sociology. See, the process of industrialization was not very smooth. It came with a lot of challenges, like workers are working with very less wages, and, okay, you can write: workers, less wages and inhuman working condition, inhuman working condition. Okay, one of the most important problem faced by workers: very low wage, inhuman working condition, number of hours of working is more, no protections, etc. Okay, so then you can. You have already said the salaries are less and working condition. Then you can see emergence of nuclear families. That also created problem, like it led to split of joint families- okay. Then a lot of migration- okay, that led to nuclear families. And you can see a lot of instances of domestic violence. Okay, you can see a lot of instances of domestic violence. Now, more and more people started migrating to the industrial area. So you can see emergence of slum- okay, so emergence of slum and a lot of new crimes- okay, more population, new crimes like pickpocketing, etc. During this time. Now, all these things led to emergence of new type of poverty and deprivation. Okay, poverty and deprivation. So earlier this industrial society and all is not there, but now this also caused a new type of poverty and deprivation. Then, when we talk about this rise of liberal democracy, rise of liberal democracy was not actually very smooth, right. See, in societies like england and all, it was gradual. Okay, the conversion from authoritarian or aristocracy to democracy was gradual. But in societies like france it was preceded by a revolution, french revolution. So a lot of uncertainties was present about the success of democracy, because democracy was altogether new for them. So you can write a point: uncertainty, uncertainty about the success of democracy, okay, uncertainty about the success of democracy was always present and that led to insecurity among the minds of people.\",\n",

So the reliance on the religion actually came down. So this is actually the beginning of secularism. We'll come to that, okay. Now the second dimension. You can understand as economic, various changes in economic dimension, what all things happen. The rational organization of production. Now the production is rationalized, okay, so you can write: rational organization of production. Rational organization of production. Then you can see: use of technology, industrial revolution, okay, use of technology. See, when we talk about modernity, one of the most important aspect you need to talk about is actually industrial revolution, okay. So i told you already, age of enlightenment or renaissance period is in terms of commercial, intellectual and scientific revolution. In that scientific and commercial revolution we already understood, right, we already spoke about, in that actually industrial revolution is automatically implied. Okay, so, use of technology. Then rise of new companies. You can write here: rise of new companies, new management practices. Earlier in traditional society, the joint family used to take care of all these things, but now new management practices, etc. New management practices, expansion in trade. So these are the changes that you can see in economic dimension. So when we talk about modernity, two dimensions, one is intellectual and the other is economic. Now let's see what are the changes you can see in political dimension, or the dimension of modernity on the political side. Okay, so you can see the change from authoritarian to democratic system. Okay, so you can write here: change from authoritarian to representative form. Or you can write it as democracy: okay, democracy, especially after french revolution, and all okay.

See, these changes are highly desirable and appreciated in the beginning because european society earlier was based on. You know already that we discussed about dark ages. Right now, these changes are highly desirable. But what happened is, with time, these changes caused a lot of challenges before modernity, although these things are expected and desirable. But it also posed a lot of challenges before modernity. So we need to see what are the challenges, and that challenges led to emergence of sociology. See, the process of industrialization was not very smooth. It came with a lot of challenges, like workers are working with very less wages, and, okay, you can write: workers, less wages and inhuman working condition, inhuman working condition. Okay, one of the most important problem faced by workers: very low wage, inhuman working condition, number of hours of working is more, no protections, etc. Okay, so then you can. You have already said the salaries are less and working condition. Then you can see emergence of nuclear families. That also created problem, like it led to split of joint families- okay. Then a lot of migration- okay, that led to nuclear families. And you can see a lot of instances of domestic violence. Okay, you can see a lot of instances of domestic violence. Now, more and more people started migrating to the industrial area. So you can see emergence of slum- okay, so emergence of slum and a lot of new crimes- okay, more population, new crimes like pickpocketing, etc. During this time. Now, all these things led to emergence of new type of poverty and deprivation. Okay, poverty and deprivation. So earlier this industrial society and all is not there, but now this also caused a new type of poverty and deprivation. Then, when we talk about this rise of liberal democracy, rise of liberal democracy was not actually very smooth, right. See, in societies like england and all, it was gradual. Okay, the conversion from authoritarian or aristocracy to democracy was gradual. But in societies like france it was preceded by a revolution, french revolution. So a lot of uncertainties was present about the success of democracy, because democracy was altogether new for them. So you can write a point: uncertainty, uncertainty about the success of democracy, okay, uncertainty about the success of democracy was always present and that led to insecurity among the minds of people. Okay, insecurity among the minds of people. Then we have also discussed about rise of middle class. Right, rise of middle class, see, actually rise of middle class- created a divide in society. Till then you have an upper class and a lower class. There are no intermediary. Either you belong to upper class or lower class. Now what happened is new class emerged, middle class. That created a divide in society and that caused a lot of another problems. So the emerging aspirations of the middle class could not be accommodated within the existing framework of the society. So there felt a need to redefine the society. So middle class emergence was also one of the reason for emergence of sociology. Okay, then now we have all these developments like you can talk about. The industrialization was not very smooth. The rise of democracy was also came to be associated with a lot of problems. Rise of middle class again was creating social divide. So to explain all these changes, you don't have a body of knowledge present at that time. Economics cannot define this, politics cannot define this right. So history cannot define all those things. So there is a need for a new discipline arise. Okay, so that is actually the emergence now that set the context for sociology, that actually set the context for sociology. I told you already about intellectuals. Now the intellectuals started thinking of a new discipline which can explain all the changes, also to solve all these problems and also to predict future of the society. And finally, people started thinking of a discipline which is similar to science. Okay, scientific discipline like physics, chemistry, biology, etc. But later the french sociologist, auguste comte, not only coined the word sociology, he also laid the basic foundation of sociology. Now, even before that, another intellectual, saint simon. Saint simon who thought of social physics, but it could not be implemented. And then auguste comte, who not only coined the term, who also laid the foundation for sociology and he is considered as the father of sociology. So auguste comte is considered as the father of sociology. Now, both the saint simon, both saint simon and auguste comte were french philosophers. Right, the reason is actually: the immediate context was present in french, because french society was in total turmoil or chaos after the french revolution. Okay, so the immediate context was present in france and that's the reason why they thought of a science which can explain all the problems and to solve the problem and to predict the future course of the society. So saint simon thought of social physics on the line, similar to natural science. That is physics. But auguste comte later laid the foundation for sociology and he is considered as the father of sociology. I hope this is clear for all of you. Now, after this, with this, your answer is not complete. You need to also talk about the intellectual background. Okay, that we have discussed about saint simon and auguste comte. Then in the future sessions we will be discussing about scope of sociology and we are going to discuss about a lot of other thinkers. You can add the points from that here and you can write with the help of these thinkers. Sociology and the scope of sociology is widened. Okay, then you can also talk about certain methods and methodologies that we are going to use in sociology from the next discussion, and you can add it over here. With that, your answer will be complete. Okay, now the other factors which also help the emergence of sociology is actually the intellectual context. Okay, you need to also discuss about the intellectual context. We have a very well developed political history, intellectual context- right, we have a very well developed political history which provided huge data of the society and that actually helped a lot in sociology. Okay, so a political history, and during 19th century you can see a lot of new methods were devised for the investigation purposes- okay, and that also could be used readily in sociology, like survey method, survey method, etc. Okay, so this also helped.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"So there felt a need to redefine the society. So middle class emergence was also one of the reason for emergence of sociology. Okay, then now we have all these developments like you can talk about. The industrialization was not very smooth. The rise of democracy was also came to be associated with a lot of problems. Rise of middle class again was creating social divide. So to explain all these changes, you don't have a body of knowledge present at that time. Economics cannot define this, politics cannot define this right. So history cannot define all those things. So there is a need for a new discipline arise. Okay, so that is actually the emergence now that set the context for sociology, that actually set the context for sociology. I told you already about intellectuals. Now the intellectuals started thinking of a new discipline which can explain all the changes, also to solve all these problems and also to predict future of the society. And finally, people started thinking of a discipline which is similar to science. Okay, scientific discipline like physics, chemistry, biology, etc. But later the french sociologist, auguste comte, not only coined the word sociology, he also laid the basic foundation of sociology. Now, even before that, another intellectual, saint simon. Saint simon who thought of social physics, but it could not be implemented. And then auguste comte, who not only coined the term, who also laid the foundation for sociology and he is considered as the father of sociology. So auguste comte is considered as the father of sociology. Now, both the saint simon, both saint simon and auguste comte were french philosophers. Right, the reason is actually: the immediate context was present in french, because french society was in total turmoil or chaos after the french revolution. Okay, so the immediate context was present in france and that's the reason why they thought of a science which can explain all the problems and to solve the problem and to predict the future course of the society. So saint simon thought of social physics on the line, similar to natural science. That is physics. But auguste comte later laid the foundation for sociology and he is considered as the father of sociology. I hope this is clear for all of you. Now, after this, with this, your answer is not complete. You need to also talk about the intellectual background. Okay, that we have discussed about saint simon and auguste comte. Then in the future sessions we will be discussing about scope of sociology and we are going to discuss about a lot of other thinkers. You can add the points from that here and you can write with the help of these thinkers. Sociology and the scope of sociology is widened. Okay, then you can also talk about certain methods and methodologies that we are going to use in sociology from the next discussion, and you can add it over here. With that, your answer will be complete. Okay, now the other factors which also help the emergence of sociology is actually the intellectual context. Okay, you need to also discuss about the intellectual context. We have a very well developed political history, intellectual context- right, we have a very well developed political history which provided huge data of the society and that actually helped a lot in sociology. Okay, so a political history, and during 19th century you can see a lot of new methods were devised for the investigation purposes- okay, and that also could be used readily in sociology, like survey method, survey method, etc. Okay, so this also helped. Okay, so you can talk about intellectual context, like this well developed political history and various methods were established or devised which could be readily used in sociology, just like survey method. And also you can also talk about darwin's theory of evolution, darwin's theory of biological evolution, which also used to study the evolution of society. Okay, now when we talk about herbert spencer, we are going to discuss more about this theory of evolution. And when we talk about marx in thinger's chapter, there also i tell you how you can see the theory of evolution, okay, the application of theory of evolution in sociology. So the point is, let me go for a quick recap what all things we have discussed. If you get a question- emergence of sociology, or if you get a question modernity and social change and emergence of sociology, or if you get a statement- modernity- sociology emerged in response to the challenges posed before modernity- in statements or in quotes, and comment critically, analyze or analyze, or whatever be the question. This is your answer. Okay, so first you will talk about dark ages. Okay, one or two line european society before the age of enlightenment was characterized by feudal, agricultural, feudal estate system and chose priest etc. Gave excessive reliance on religion and political aristocracy was engaged in wars, unmindful of the plight of the people, right? So that is what about dark ages, you can write. Then you will talk about age of enlightenment in terms of scientific revolution, intellectual revolution and commercial revolution, and you see the changes caused by all these things. And then that led to emergence of sociology. Then you can talk about modernity, the elements of modernity or the dimensions of modernity, the four dimensions that we have discussed: intellectual, political, economic and social. And then you can also write about the macro changes that caused by modernity: right intellectualism, rise of middle class, rise of new liberal democracy, rise of an industrial society. Then you can talk about the micro changes which caused by this micro changes: industrial society, the evolution of industrial society or the industrialization was not that smooth. It came into associated with a lot of social problems like migration, emergence of slum, workers were working in inhuman working condition with very less wages, etc. And that created a new type of crimes and new type of poverty and deprivation came into existence. Then when you talk about emergence of liberal democracy, that also came with a lot of uncertainty, because if you talk about societies like england, and all the process was gradual, but in societies like french it was preceded by a revolution, so the uncertainty about the success of democracy was there in the minds of the people. And when you talk about the middle class, middle class actually created a divide in the society, so there was a need to redefine the society was felt. So all these changes you need to explain. You cannot explain all the changes with the existing bodies of knowledge, so you need a new discipline to explain all these things and a lot of intellectuals, especially french philosophers like saint simon and auguste comte, thought of a discipline which can explain all these things, because the immediate context was present in french, because french society was in complete turmoil. And saint simon thought of social physics.\",\n",

Right, the reason is actually: the immediate context was present in french, because french society was in total turmoil or chaos after the french revolution. Okay, so the immediate context was present in france and that's the reason why they thought of a science which can explain all the problems and to solve the problem and to predict the future course of the society. So saint simon thought of social physics on the line, similar to natural science. That is physics. But auguste comte later laid the foundation for sociology and he is considered as the father of sociology. I hope this is clear for all of you. Now, after this, with this, your answer is not complete. You need to also talk about the intellectual background. Okay, that we have discussed about saint simon and auguste comte. Then in the future sessions we will be discussing about scope of sociology and we are going to discuss about a lot of other thinkers. You can add the points from that here and you can write with the help of these thinkers. Sociology and the scope of sociology is widened. Okay, then you can also talk about certain methods and methodologies that we are going to use in sociology from the next discussion, and you can add it over here. With that, your answer will be complete. Okay, now the other factors which also help the emergence of sociology is actually the intellectual context. Okay, you need to also discuss about the intellectual context. We have a very well developed political history, intellectual context- right, we have a very well developed political history which provided huge data of the society and that actually helped a lot in sociology. Okay, so a political history, and during 19th century you can see a lot of new methods were devised for the investigation purposes- okay, and that also could be used readily in sociology, like survey method, survey method, etc. Okay, so this also helped. Okay, so you can talk about intellectual context, like this well developed political history and various methods were established or devised which could be readily used in sociology, just like survey method. And also you can also talk about darwin's theory of evolution, darwin's theory of biological evolution, which also used to study the evolution of society. Okay, now when we talk about herbert spencer, we are going to discuss more about this theory of evolution. And when we talk about marx in thinger's chapter, there also i tell you how you can see the theory of evolution, okay, the application of theory of evolution in sociology. So the point is, let me go for a quick recap what all things we have discussed. If you get a question- emergence of sociology, or if you get a question modernity and social change and emergence of sociology, or if you get a statement- modernity- sociology emerged in response to the challenges posed before modernity- in statements or in quotes, and comment critically, analyze or analyze, or whatever be the question. This is your answer. Okay, so first you will talk about dark ages. Okay, one or two line european society before the age of enlightenment was characterized by feudal, agricultural, feudal estate system and chose priest etc. Gave excessive reliance on religion and political aristocracy was engaged in wars, unmindful of the plight of the people, right? So that is what about dark ages, you can write. Then you will talk about age of enlightenment in terms of scientific revolution, intellectual revolution and commercial revolution, and you see the changes caused by all these things. And then that led to emergence of sociology. Then you can talk about modernity, the elements of modernity or the dimensions of modernity, the four dimensions that we have discussed: intellectual, political, economic and social. And then you can also write about the macro changes that caused by modernity: right intellectualism, rise of middle class, rise of new liberal democracy, rise of an industrial society. Then you can talk about the micro changes which caused by this micro changes: industrial society, the evolution of industrial society or the industrialization was not that smooth. It came into associated with a lot of social problems like migration, emergence of slum, workers were working in inhuman working condition with very less wages, etc. And that created a new type of crimes and new type of poverty and deprivation came into existence. Then when you talk about emergence of liberal democracy, that also came with a lot of uncertainty, because if you talk about societies like england, and all the process was gradual, but in societies like french it was preceded by a revolution, so the uncertainty about the success of democracy was there in the minds of the people. And when you talk about the middle class, middle class actually created a divide in the society, so there was a need to redefine the society was felt. So all these changes you need to explain. You cannot explain all the changes with the existing bodies of knowledge, so you need a new discipline to explain all these things and a lot of intellectuals, especially french philosophers like saint simon and auguste comte, thought of a discipline which can explain all these things, because the immediate context was present in french, because french society was in complete turmoil. And saint simon thought of social physics. But later auguste comte, who not only coined the term sociology but also laid the foundation for sociology, and auguste comte is known as the father of sociology. Then you need to talk about the intellectual background. You can talk about well-established political history. You can talk about various methods, like survey method. You can talk about darwin's theory of evolution. Then, whatever things we are going to discuss in the coming sessions, you can add one or two points from that. Thinkers, you're going to discuss various perspectives. You're going to discuss various methods. You need to be accommodated those things here. Then the answer is complete.\",\n",

You know what is the problem here in your personality: ruthlessness. I will explain how. Ruthlessness, if you are given at this stage, between 3 to 6 years- too much initiative without any guilt, when you develop as a person, adult, you take initiative for your goals, but in ruthless fashion because you don't feel guilty. And when you are achieving your goal, you don't care what happens to others. You step on their head or you step on their chest. You don't care what happens to others, you want to achieve your goal. That is the problem. When you are given too much initiative without guilt, you become ruthless. But if this ingredient is over too much, then you have another trouble and that trouble is severe inhibition and too much inhibition in everything. You are not going to take any initiative in the life. Have you seen some people who don't want to make any decision for themselves? They want others to make their decision. They don't want to do any venture. They say: nothing ventured, nothing lost. What is happening with them? They are inhibited and even this may end up in males with impotence and females in frigidity. Right so this? There should be always a beautiful balance in between the two a little more towards positive side, that you should develop a personality with strong initiative, with touch of guilt. This is very important, the touch of guilt, because if you don't develop the touch of guilt, your parents just tell you whatever you want to do and you are having full initiative for everything and full support. What happens? You become a selfish adult. You don't care what happens to others while you are going for your own goals. Is that right? Anyway?\",\n",

I want to kind of highlight that point that there could be some products out there where they're on the label, but there's really not enough amount to be effective. Now, when we go through these individual microbes here, i don't know, i'm kind of kind of putting you under the gun here. If you have any information on what cfu should be for each of these microbes as we go through of it, please, you know, let us know. So we're not getting ripped off here, oh for sure. But generally it's look for the highest numbers you can find. Just in my opinion, having more good microbes in there, like those populations will figure themselves out once they're in the soil and into that environment where they actually start to get selected for the environment that they're in. But yeah, generally just a bigger number is better in this case and so we don't really need to worry about like a balance. We don't have to like look at the back of the label and say, well, this only has this cfus, but this has a lot higher and it might throw off the diversity. Do we have to worry about that? So that's so like labeling with things is a big game that you have to play the back of labels. It's almost always even your fertilizers that you buy, where it'll have like 20-20-20 on the side of it. That's a guaranteed minimum. That's not necessarily saying like the exact proportion of everything that's in there. So it's it's so hard and like soil.\",\n",

First, ace inhibitors, now ace: angiotensin converting enzyme is in the lung, right, that's right. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin one to angiotensin two. So when i say ace inhibitors, here we've got our wonderful little character, our ace card with inhibiting chains, and we've got what? Well, we've got our little pearls, because ace inhibitors end in pril, that's right. So ace inhibitors end in pril. So we've got the fun little pearls here with our ace card with inhibiting chains. I mean little ace card just got the little chain there, poor little thing, anyway. So ace inhibitors. You need to remember pril, p-r-i-l, so you're going to learn lots of different ace inhibitors just by memorizing the drug ending. But if i say ace inhibitors, the first thing that should roll out of your mouth is: what side effect do we have to watch for right away? I mean it should be at the tip of your tongue. You should be spitting it out: cough, that's right, cough, a dry cough. Ace inhibitors. Because of the inhibiting ace, it also inhibits bradykinin and bradykinin basically causes a decrease of secretions, or a decrease. It allows for irritation, basically in the throat and can cause this dry cough. That's a number one reason we need to look for it's a very high yield question and we'd want to switch them to another type of medication.\",\n",

Now, what is the situation in which the equilibrium can break? That will be addressed separately in another theory, another part. That is what you call a cybernetic hierarchy of control, where i will explain how this equilibrium will be broken. So here, temporarily, you just need to see that equilibrium will be broken at some situation. That means there will be some disturbance. I just write it as disturbance. Disturbance means disequilibrium or the equilibrium will be broken. Then what will happen is there will be a feedback which will be given to mechanisms so they will act again and they will fulfill the needs and they will bring back the equilibrium. So let us say there are more crimes are coming. So what will happen? The feedback will be given, so the police system, judicial system, etc. Will be getting active and fulfill the needs and bring the equilibrium, like that. So the disturbance here is temporary. Now, if you compare it with marx, the disturbance are permanent. So the solution is revolution here. That is not the case. It is a temporary disturbance with the feedback which the system will give can solve the problem within itself. So the mechanism. Let us see the system: traditional society, joint family, which was based on joint family. Joint family fulfilled the needs of the feudal setup, feudal way of life and the traditional setup and there was an equilibrium. But when the capitalist setup came or the industries came, now what is required? Joint family will not be enough. So there is a change to nuclear family. So nuclear family now fulfilled the needs which is required for the system and bring back the new equilibrium. So the new equilibrium now based on nuclear family, and when it proceeds further.',\n",

I picked one of carlin's originals here, and the first thing you have to know is that it needs to be fairly flat before you start. This is flat enough. We use a press here at carlin's, but if you have a ripley watercolor original at home, you'd like to spritz it with the back with your fine mister or some other sprayer, put it on something flat, protect it with a towel or a piece of release paper and then you can press it with an iron on steam setting, get it nice and warm, hot and soft and then lay a book or something over it until it cools. The next part is to select a mat. I've picked this one. I like the green around the edge, i like the contrast, and i like this because it'll show up well on the camera that we're using here today. What i'd like to find out first of all is how wide the sides are. Generally, your mats will be the same all the way around, unless they're bottom-weighted, but even ones that have the hole or the window centered are going to have some variation, and i always like to have the widest one on the bottom. So this is three and a quarter, this is three and five. Sixteenths, three and a quarter. Three and a quarter. That makes this slightly wider than the other three. You maybe can't tell, but it is. And when we're finished and it sits down into your picture frame, gravity is going to take over and it should even out.

The thing is, we don't just read our news anymore, we interact with it, and we've built these incredibly powerful but also really dumb algorithms that are simply designed to just maximise engagement, no matter what, and it seems like anger is like rocket fuel for that, because it's not only a negative emotion, it's also a very active one that triggers us into action, you know, to go and defend our tribe, and so it gets amplified way beyond how people would naturally behave. Yes, but we need all this delicious anger? We've got inequality and climate change, pandemics, lying, self-serving politicians. Doesn't it just make you furious?

In this respect, new music in the 20th century followed a material aesthetic whose normative idea was to permanently create new aesthetical material. With adorno, one can say that new music followed the ideal of so-called material progress. The paradigm of new music in the 20th century is thus composed of a descriptive and of a normative guiding idea. It was in itself understanding as absolute music and followed the normative ideal of material aesthetics or material progress. For a long time, the idea of material aesthetics was a source of innovation, but as early as the 1970s the end of material progress was reached. The last new isms, such as music, concrete instrumentals, spectralism, minimalism- they are all developed almost half a century ago. Since the 1990s, the dilemma of innovation has become evident, as even helmut lachenmann noted in an essay at that time. The idea of material aesthetics has since lost its persuasive power in new music and, as here in the model, began to fade since the first signs of exhaustion of material progress. It took another four decades until the digital revolution created a real chance to get out of this innovation dead end. In germany, digitization in new music become a topic of discussion around 2008.. This year, i presented a thought experiment on this topic at the darmstadt spring conference. The decisive factor was that youtube had been around since 2005, and composers were beginning to discover the platform for themselves from this time of 2008,- 2009,. for example, johannes kreitel created charts music, peter ablinger the talking piano and trond reinhardsen the complete music performance videos.',\n",

So let me start with the very first simple attribute. When you look back in hr, we very often followed on a definition, a traditional definition of human resource management which says human resource management is about right people at the right time at the right place. This is a very traditional view: right time, right place, right people. But what does that mean? Right people, what is that? So we always had an idea saying: okay, firstly, before we fill a position, we have to be absolutely clear about the requirements people must fit into, must fit, must match to predefined profiles. And sometimes you can see in companies that there is a kind of common profile, there are common expectations. And i will put things extreme now. I will do it a couple of times, knowing that things are very often somewhere in between. But a very extreme view is that you want in your organization that the people are all more or less the same: same thinking, same attitudes, same whatever. And this is the very often cited box. People must fit into a box and the box is there, it's predefined. First comes the box and when you think in terms of boxes, saying our employees must fit to specific criteria, conformity is very essential in your organization. So you can sometimes tell it when you visit a company, and i do it very often. So i visit an office, let's say i visit a company, and i have the feeling that the people all look the same, they have same style, they have same competencies, they are more or less the same, while in another company on the other side of the road, you visit that one and you have the feeling that, wow, that's very colored.

What is in the basket on the left side of the screen has to be owned by some party on the right side of the screen, either a creditor or the owner of the business. Therefore, assets have to be equal to liabilities plus owner equity. This basic equation- assets equal liabilities plus owner equity- is called the accounting equation, and in doing accounting, all we ever do is keep track of what the business assets are and who owns them. People often refer to accountants as bean counters, but i think you understand now that really accountants are asset and equity counters.

So the second observation leads you to think again and recall what else you did yesterday. You remember that you put your cell phone in your backpack during school, so you decide it must be there and you go and check and lo, there it is. Life can continue and you're so happy that you share the results with your best friend and explain why it took you so long to text them back. Science, these are the steps of the scientific method, and at any step you can go back and repeat the process. Typically, after you conduct an experiment and conclude that your results aren't answering the question, you go back and try something else and really, truly, observations and research are going on the entire time. Science is a continually ongoing process. Now let's break down each of these steps into their component parts. All that can be observed with the five senses are included in observations. You use your sense of smell, sight, taste, touch and hearing to make your observations in science. Research is an important step in science because it may answer other questions you have and help refine your experiment. Before you go down a path that leads to nowhere or conduct an experiment that's already been done, make sure you use reliable sources to learn background information. Scientific journals and online sources that are vetted and trusted are best. Avoid information from blogs and out-of-date textbooks, as the information might not be reliable. Once you have your research completed, you can form your hypothesis, which is a prediction of what you believe will occur. It is often seen as an if-then statement and is very specific. Here's an example: if gummy bears are placed in water for 24 hours, then they will swell to over twice their original size.\",\n",

Okay, very good, let's do an example. No, let's not do an example. Let's finish the postulate, because there's a special case that you have to be aware of because we're going to say these words a lot now. Not all states are somehow the same. Some states are purer than other states. The terminology that we use for such special states is pure state. A pure state is one that cannot be prepared as a probabilistic mixture of two other states. We'll come more to that in a minute. For pure states, those are represented for pure states. Those are represented as a one-dimensional projector and that will need some comment and i will give some comment about that in a minute. So that means that your state, rho, is called pure, if you can write rho as a product of a column vector and a rho vector in this way. Okay, i'll do some examples to illustrate this postulate in a second. Let's put the whole postulate there. A preparation in quantum mechanics- simplified quantum mechanics- is characterized by a state. A state is a density matrix. This is a positive matrix, rho, which acts on our hilbert space and has trace one. And specifically for so-called pure states, rho has a special form.

Now, it's, of course, way too big, but we can easily fix that by scaling it up. So, as you can see, it is super easy to get started here in sketchup, and you can also get into a lot more complicated things, as you do have a bit more features than inside of tinkercad, where it is limited to the basic shapes. Here you can create basically anything. There's arcs and whatnot and all the different features that you could want.\",\n",

The only difference is a little bit of configuration here and there, but that's usually copied from some sort of documentation or you just need to turn on some options, for example, to make the thing work. So essentially, the principles we are going to see here in this video apply to every other platform which provides devops operations. So first things first, what is continuous integration? Continuous integration means that your code is validated on a standalone server, it's built and its tests are run. These are two common tasks that you can see in almost every project. So essentially, what i can do is i can, instead of running all my tests locally, i can trigger a build. If i have too many tests and i don't want to wait for 15 minutes, for example, i can just push my code and wait for the continuous integration service to report results. That's one thing. Also, another positive side of using continuous integration is that usually when you develop alone, you won't have that much problems. You won't have that much changes to your system, you won't have that much issues or bugs or whatever. But when you work in a team, when you work with more than five people, for example, and everybody is merging code in the same repository in the same place, bad things happen because you may change a module which is required by someone else's work, but he didn't reflect the change in his part of the system and everything will work correctly on your machine. But when you merge the code and upload it, it will show that you have some bugs, you have some problems and so on.\",\n",

I'll let you do the math on that one. This is my last commission i have remaining, so let's crush it. So, if you weren't aware, a knight is a very large model with many pieces. Because of this, even a simple step like cleaning and assembling the model can take a decently long time, just like on smaller miniatures. We're clipping away various parts off of the sprue, shaving away extra sprue bits, removing mold lines, filling gaps, drilling holes in otherwise solid gun barrels and gluing together some parts with plastic glue.

But with a computer we can look at a lot more design options a lot faster and through multi-objective optimization we can be able to find well-performing design solutions. So how does it work? Its background lies in and the natural principle of evolution. So through mutation we get different variations of genes and then, through natural selection, those that don't perform well get ruled out, and this process repeats itself until we end up with a diverse set of very well adapted genes. And if we translate that to design, the individuals in a population are the different design solutions and the genes the chromosomes are represented by the values of the properties of the model, so in a parametric model, the values for the parameters. So what we want to do is basically generate a bunch of different design solutions, evaluate them based on their performance and then use the principles of evolution to optimize them and generate new solutions. And to imitate this process of evolution, a few different genetic algorithms have been developed in the past couple of decades. The ones that we use today work quite similarly. So a population is generated, then for each individual the fitness is calculated and then we use the evolutionary operators of selection, crossover and mutation to create a new generation. And what a genetic algorithm is supposed to do is preserve previously found good solutions- that is a principle called elitism- and progress to the true pareto front as fast as possible, which is the convergence rate, as well as- and this is especially important in design- provide a diverse set of solutions to the human decision maker, so that the final solution can be selected by the human designer. And this is especially important in design because we are most of the time dealing with multi objective optimization problems. That means we have multiple, often contradicting, design goals or objectives.\",\n",

Volume is the measurement of how much space an object occupies. The volume of a regular cube can be calculated with the following formula: length multiplied by width, multiplied by height. The si units are in meters, so the answer will be in cubic meters. Depending on the size of the object, you may use millimeters or centimeters, so these will be cubic millimeters or cubic centimeters. The next derived si unit is density. Density can be defined as the mass per unit volume. Basically, it tells us how much kilograms are in every cubic meter of the object. We measure it by dividing the mass in kilograms by the volume in cubic meters. So the derived si unit for density is kilograms per cubic meter. So why is this important to know? Knowing what quantities to use means that you will be working on the same level as everyone else. You can compare your answers because you are using the same formula. Now you know that derived quantities are quantities that are based on the seven fundamental quantities of the si system. There are meters squared for area, cubic meters for volume and kilograms per cubic meter for density. It's always good to go over these quantities again and get used to using them. Why not try finding these quantities for an object you have at home, see what the area, volume and density is and convert it to si units. Happy measuring.\",\n",

The black keys are named according to their location compared to the key, either to their left or right. To handle this, we use fancy terms called sharps and flats. Sharp means we go up to the next closest key, and a flat means we go down to the next closest key. The gap between each key on a piano is called either a half-step or a semitone. For example, the black key directly to the right of c is one semitone above c and therefore called c-sharp. However, as if this weren't confusing enough already, the same exact note is also called d-flat because it lies one semitone below d. so now to really hit it home, let's quickly recap all the notes in any given octave, starting with c, c-sharp, d, d-sharp, e, f, f-sharp, g, g-sharp, a, a-sharp, b, bringing us to a grand total of 12 semitones in a single octave. Scales: scales are a collection of notes that sound good when played together. This note may sound fine by itself, but when played in succession with these other notes, not so much. This is because it's not in the same scale as the other notes and therefore is considered off-key. The two most common types of scales are major and minor major scales generally sound happy, while minor scales sound sad. A scale has a root note which it's named after, for example, c-major.\",\n",

These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. In addition, there are other organic compounds that may be found in or produced by some organisms. All organic compounds contain carbon, usually bonded to hydrogen. Let's take a closer look at the key types of organic compounds and see examples of these important molecules. Let us explore more about these compounds. Let us start with the most familiar one, which is carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are organic compounds made up of elements such as carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. One example of carbohydrates is glucose, or blood sugar, and its chemical formula is c6h12o6.. as you can see, it only has carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Another thing that you can notice if you will look at the chemical formula: the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 12 is to 6.. Simplifying it, the ratio of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms in carbohydrate molecules is 2 is to 1.. now let us have the uses of carbohydrates in organisms. Carbohydrates is used as the main or primary energy source, especially in humans. Also, it can make up cell structures. In addition, they are also used as stored energy in plants. From lots of vegetables that we eat, we are actually eating their stored energy in the form of starch, like potatoes and grains. Carbohydrates are classified according to how many subunits they contain. Simple carbohydrates are called sugar. A sugar made of one unit is called monosaccharide.\",\n",

I would like to show you a clip from the film that was shown during the concert. You will first see how the pianist plays through the entire repertoire of modern piano music, from debussy to stockhausen, to come up with new ideas. Then she takes a cat to the composer's studio and the time for the empty set appears, which, in this context, means that all assumptions and values of new music should be suspended. The piano concert makes a clear sweep and seeks a radical new beginning. The pianist searches, together with three trolls, for a way out of the so-called postmodern march. These are pure e-player compositions in which all vocal parts were by franz heinrichson himself sung and edited on the computer. Piano only no vocals. Piano only no vocals. Piano- only no vocals.

You know, that's true to some extent. You know that a bank should have a little more skin in the game. If you're gonna originate a loan, you should vet that borrower and make sure they have the credit and the income necessary to. You know, continue to make payments. But the notion that you know a bank selling a loan to another bank is inherently evil, you know. I would encourage you to think about that, because imagine that wells fargo made, let's say, a billion dollars in mortgage origination this year. Then next year wells fargo has a meeting and says: you know what? We're way too heavy into real estate loans. We don't wanna make any more real estate loans anymore. Let's focus more on auto loans. Now, borrowers that come into wells fargo to borrow money to buy houses the next year aren't gonna be able to secure financing because they're otherwise qualified. It's just that the bank doesn't wanna play in that sandbox anymore because they have- you know, they've made- too many loans of that type. So in order to kind of keep money flowing through the system and keep credit flowing through the system and make sure there's always money available for real estate loans, the government actually participates in this secondary market where these loans are purchased from other investors just to free up capital and make sure that money stays flowing through the system.\",\n",

I did this because it was better to overestimate how much copper i needed than to not add enough. Now to mix the copper with it, i had to melt it all together. I'd done this before on a very small scale in a porcelain dish, but never with this much metal. There are many different setups that people use to do this, but i wanted to go with the simplest and the cheapest. From some videos that i saw, i found that it was possible to just do it with a paint can, some blowtorches and fiberglass insulation. So i ordered the fiberglass from amazon and i went and picked up the torches and the paint can from my local hardware store. Also, while i was on amazon, i picked up this small metal melting starter kit. Now, to put this whole can thing together, it was really easy. I just had to cut out a small circle to cover the bottom and then i cut a larger piece to cover the sides of the can for the torches. I drilled a hole in each side and shoved them in. I then put a crucible that i had inside, turned on the torches and tried to position them properly to try to keep the heat inside. I covered the top with more fiberglass and i waited for it to warm up. As a point of safety, though, some torch heads, like the one i have on the right, are made of brass. For general use, this is totally fine, but in this case, the tips of the torches are surrounded by insulation. This causes them to heat up way more than normal, and with brass, it can start releasing toxic zinc vapor.\",\n",

Rondo form consists of repeating a material, separated throughout the movement with areas of contrasting or developmental material. The a material serves as a main anchoring theme that comes back throughout the movement and is known as a ritornello. The contrasting episodes between ritornellos are shown here in the b and c sections. Another common form used during the classical period in compositions with multiple movements is the binary or rounded binary form. In four-movement sonatas, symphonies and string quartets, these binary forms could be used for the second or third movement. It's important to note here that binary form and rounded binary form get used in almost every genre of classical period music. As noted in the diagrams for these movements, each section moves through specific key areas. While some baroque music used the same key areas in their sonatas, the system of tonality that was codified during the classical period was not written out until jean-philippe rameau's treatise on harmony in 1722.. In his treatise, rameau incorporated mathematics to argue for a harmonic gravity, whereby a fundamental base served as the musical ground from which all harmonic movement originates and must necessarily return to.

If we take a look at some of the buildings he designed, a lot of the architecture nowadays is, in a way, trying to mimic his style. Basically, most of those typical looking houses that we see on pinterest or in instagram are mimics of what he way back in the 1950s. If you want to dig deeper into his philosophy, i highly recommend you take a look at more of his work right after you finish this video. So the first type of minimalism is aesthetic minimalism, which might be the most popular form of minimalism that is today. I think we can all agree that clutter isn't pretty. Therefore, this type of minimalism strives a simple and clean aesthetic. Clean lines, white walls and a few belongings have become such an interior design trend in the last few years and it's hard to escape from the popularity of it with all the exposure that it gets on social media. Decorating, tidying and general living are a lot more complicated when you have a wide range of ornaments or stuff in general in our living areas and instead minimalist seems to always have one of these type of pictures in the wall and usually a color scheme of white, beige and gray. The second type of minimalism is eco-minimalism. Eco-minimalism in design seeks to lower the amount of items so in the future there is less waste produced by that living area. People that experience eco-minimalist design primarily enjoy the benefits on the overall environmental impact that their lifestyle has, but at the same time unconsciously experience decluttering and the psychological aspect of it.\",\n",

So i've always just loved voice communication apps and basically my entire life, even when i was a child, i was always building voice communication apps because i thought it was so cool. So root is a communication platform in the social space and, to give you some perspective, the other major application in this space is an app called discord. So if you're familiar with what discord is, we're basically building a communication platform at that scale and we're looking at opportunities where we can innovate and improve, which we think. We've discovered a bunch of those where there's a lot of areas in discord that we can make better, and that's what we've been doing for the last few years.

Dll injection: so dll injection is a form of an attack, but does this maintain capability between newer os and older versions of the software? No, does it apply to the first part of the question?

When your software has a bug, typically you cannot reasonably quote-unquote handle the situation. Instead you should focus on detecting, reporting and ultimately fixing the bug. Also, you typically cannot continue execution. Instead, you must carefully devise a damage control strategy. This is where the assertions come in. In contrast to errors, exceptional conditions are specific circumstances that can legitimately arise during the system's lifetime, but are relatively rare and lie off the main execution path of your software. Examples include incorrect user input, transmission, errors on inherently unreliable connections such as wireless, abnormal or degraded modes of operation, etc. In those cases, you should not use assertions. Rather, you must carefully design and implement strategies that handle such exceptional conditions using regular code. Attempting to quote-unquote handle an error as an exceptional condition is just as bad as the other way around. This programming style is known as defensive programming. It aims to make the software more robust to errors by accepting a wider range of inputs or allowing an order of operations inconsistent with the program's state. For example, a defensively programmed int-div function would not assert, but instead it would quote-unquote handle the 0 divisor by returning some bogus value, such as 0xffff. Similarly, a defensively programmed int-log2 would quote-unquote handle the below-the-range x by returning, say, negative 1, the above-the-range value by another made-up value, such as 999, and only otherwise the real value from the lookup table.\",\n",

So i'll start by telling you guys what the answer is. The answer is gonna be option three- assess the client's pain level. Then option four- check the client's blood pressure. And option six- administer a second nitroglycerin. So it looks like about 90% went with option three, 89% went with option four, and then option five- check the patient's blood pressure, and option six- administer a second nitroglycerin. So it looks like 89% with option four and then 82% with option six, and then also option five did seem to be an attractive option as well, at 45%. So let's talk about this a little more. First, the usual guidelines for administering nitroglycerin to a hospitalized client includes administering one tablet every five minutes, as needed for chest pain, for a total amount of three tablets. If the client does not obtain relief after taking a third dose of nitroglycerin, that's when the healthcare provider needs to be notified.\",\n",

I'm going to tell you about not quantum mechanics, but i'm going to tell you about something that we could call simplified quantum mechanics. Now i'll try and be very precise about what is being simplified here and what you're missing out on and what you're gaining. So to teach quantum mechanics properly, you do need a good grounding in all of physics so you can sort of place the theory of quantum mechanics in context, and that takes many, many years of an undergraduate degree. However, and further, you need to be comfortable, you need to really engage with infinite dimensions to do quantum mechanics as a physical theory justice. Now, these two prerequisites usually mean that quantum mechanics is incredibly hard to learn because, okay, it may be easy to learn probability theory and linear algebra, but the minute you talk about infinite dimensional vector spaces and fitting this all in the context of a broader theory of physics, that places a massive hurdle to entry, a massive barrier to entry when learning quantum mechanics. However, it turns out that for the purposes of quantum computers- learning about enough quantum mechanics to understand how quantum computers operate, or at least how to model, quantum computers. You don't need to know about infinite dimensional vector spaces- this is not required, and you don't really lose anything by not knowing that part of the quantum canon. And secondly, if you're willing to accept a couple of postulates on faith, you don't actually need to know the full baggage of all the historical development of quantum mechanics and other physical theories on which the development of quantum mechanics was built. So this is why we can teach the elements of quantum mechanics without this huge barrier to entry.\",\n",

And then the amount of your loan forgiveness would be the amount of reduction- okay, beyond the 25%.

Good producers really can see the true cost and benefit of the goods. This is obviously really important when we've got positive and negative externalities which lead to goods being priced incorrectly in terms of the socially efficient output. There are lots of effects of intervention. We're going to have a slide about each of these in a second. It's just a list, so you can see them here. I believe there are six effects of intervention: public goods, externalities, correcting information failure, price intervention, regulation and control of monopolies and the redistribution of income. Public goods are non-excludable and non-rival, which means that they don't tend to be produced in the private sector because they're unprofitable to supply. This means that the free market totally fails to provide important public goods, which is complete market failure. This means that the government has to provide them, and to provide them, the government needs to have the money to do so. It means it has to tax the people in the economy because obviously the government requires funding to be able to supply these public goods. So, in terms of correcting market failure, the government has to supply public goods. Externalities are obviously a really big issue in terms of market failure and stuff like that, with positive and negative externalities, meaning that the market mechanism output is either far higher or far lower than the socially efficient output. We have lots of different ways of trying to correct this. One of these is regulation. Regulation is rules to the firms to make sure that they try to keep their negative externalities to a low. So, for example, there might be regulation saying you can only pollute up to a certain amount. You can only use trees which were dying anyway.\",\n",

The secondary market would be if wells fargo were to sell that loan to, let's say, bank of america. That would represent activity in the secondary mortgage market.

Frankly, if you look back at this last recession, you know 2008 and 2009,- a lot of people say: well, the reason that we're kind of in this, the conundrum that we were in, the problems we were having, is because a lot of the banks would just sell off these loans and they wouldn't really care whether or not the borrower could pay. You know, that's true to some extent. You know that a bank should have a little more skin in the game. If you're gonna originate a loan, you should vet that borrower and make sure they have the credit and the income necessary to. You know, continue to make payments. But the notion that you know a bank selling a loan to another bank is inherently evil, you know. I would encourage you to think about that, because imagine that wells fargo made, let's say, a billion dollars in mortgage origination this year.

London sent ambiguous messages to berlin suggesting that britain might remain neutral if germany did not attack france. Kaiser wilhelm now asked molke to abandon the schlieffen plan and stop his armies from marching across the french border. Von molke replied that stopping the massive and complex mobilization was impossible and suicidal. Really, yo, he's wearing a mop. Look at that. Look at that. Fully understand his own military machine. Your illustrious uncle von molke the elder would not have given me such an answer. If i order it, it must be possible. Geez little full of yourself.

The mood in britain: once you do that, there's no going back. The british informed the french that they would block any german naval movements in the channel and would uphold belgian neutrality. Belgian neutrality was britain's final red line, but it was a line that germany had already begun to cross. They already committed. Germany delivered an ultimatum to belgium that it had prepared.

One of them is the possibility of breaking a rib. If you do break a rib, please try not to worry. It is at the bottom of our priorities. Breathing is first. Just make sure your hands are right in the centre of the chest and continue to do what you're doing at the correct depth. Don't change the depth of your compressions. Okay, another couple of things that might happen is the casualty might be sick. Don't worry about that. Just turn your casualty away from you, allow them to be sick, drain away, come back, check for breathing and then carry on cpr if they're still not breathing. Okay, so earlier i asked for an aed when i had a non-breathing casualty. An aed is an automated external defibrillator. It's a really clever piece of kit and it can increase the casualty's chance of survival anywhere up to around 75% if it's got to them within the first couple of minutes. So what this piece of kit will actually do is analyse the casualty's heart rhythm and determine whether there's a shockable rhythm. It will try and shock the heart in order to stop the heart, to bring it back to its normal beat, normal rhythm. Okay, so i'm just going to open this up and let you see what's in here. It's a really safe piece of kit. It can't harm you, so nothing to worry about.

And, yes, and the system needs to be dealing with that, but it is something that's important to pay attention to, but still definitely not insurmountable now. So here's an example of this implementation, of something like that. So this chip basically implements the functions of that one single branch and within that, so the architecture is shown on the lower left, so there's a downconversion processing, and then this is what we call hybrid analog digital time delay, so delay unit, and this basically allows you to control the timing, which is very important if you're dealing with data, because, as you know probably, is that in an array, it's not sufficient. If you're dealing with data, it's not sufficient to be dealing just with the phase, and also you have to deal with the actual timing of data to avoid creating distortion in the system and this system. Actually, in this example, we are operating with a free running oscillator in the system. So now the question is that how do you achieve this time delay? The challenge is that you need a fair amount of time delay. If you're not talking about systems that are on the range of several meters or higher, you're talking about 10 nanoseconds of delay range.

The key to this feeling, for matisse, was making it look like the painting itself was effortless and natural, as if it had spontaneously formed on the canvas, appearing out of nowhere, as feelings of joy or the rhythm of dance often do themselves. To achieve this sense of natural ease, he created this first version, now referred to as dance 1, in full scale, using oil paints, which was unusual for a preparatory work, but also allowed him to plan and control every aspect of the final version. The difference between it and the version suchkin got is illustrative of matisse's process of looking and reworking and the kind of results it could produce. The second version of dance keeps the aspects of simplicity and rhythm, but there's been some changes to the colours and the figures that drastically alter the tone. Unlike the soft, amorphous forms of the dancers before, these figures have harsher angles, traces of outlines that denote a strength of form not present in dance 1.. then there is the colour. The rusted red that the figures are soaked in creates a very different feeling to the soft pink flesh tones of before. These figures seem somehow more primitive and tribal. We can almost hear the chanting and drumbeats of ritual that the movements imply. The refinement of the concept has uncovered something different in the concept of dance, something ancient and ritualistic, as if we are seeing the genesis of the act itself. Matisse's ultra-simple painting style has exposed this expressive quality in a way that more realistic methods would struggle to depict. Just as with the fauvist works, dance also makes use of ultra-saturated tones that pretty much tell colour theory to take a hike.\",\n",

And the old adage of pictures worth a thousand words, well, a video is worth like a hundred thousand words. That's why we're doing video right now as well. To be able to communicate to you like this, you need to make sure that you're as information rich as humanly possible when you communicate.

So what i suggest you do is, if your budget is quite low, get on skype. Skype is free if you have a little bit more of a budget. Zoom is more expensive, but much better as a tool to be able to work and collaborate through video with co-workers that are remote.\",\n",

Then they develop an adult. If you are very harshly- unduly harshly- toilet-trained all your life, not only your anal sphincters become tight, i think your moral and social sphincters also become tight. Yes, people become more unduly moralistic. They start passing judgment on others. They want everything to be perfect. Because these were their mothers. They wanted perfect control on the sphincters. So because they were harshly punished for their sphincter failures, so themselves they got very tight control on their sphincter. But that affects their whole personality when they grow up. They want perfection in everything. They are obsessed with their times. They are obsessed with their schedules. They are obsessed with their programs. If any program changes they get very disturbed. Right, they are very much concerned with the list of the things and if anything is short their whole world falls apart. Is that right?

During this, when the plan is being established, you want to meet with the key stakeholders in your organization to make sure that everyone is aligned and every key person supports this adoption plan. During this step- the alignment of people who will make this plan a reality is very important. It is also a step where you map your people to the capabilities so you know who should be engaged when and once your organization is aligned, you will create skills readiness plan. During this stage, you want to review your current skill sets in your company and create a plan that will address the gaps, because in the cloud, you will need to have a lot of new skills in your company across different teams and different people, and this plan will take care of that. And once you do all those things, simply put it into so-called cloud adoption plan. This plan will be used to manage the change across your digital estate skills and the organization and the processes. To summarize, in the planning stage, we want to create actionable plan for our cloud adoption. From there we move to the next stage, called ready. So readiness stage is all about preparing your first azure environment. To do that, you start with azure setup guide, so you read azure documentation on how the initial environment should look like. You want to become familiar with the tools and approaches that will help you create this first azure environment. Also, at this stage, you will want to choose which type of azure subscription should you use and which is the best for your company?\",\n",

The advantage of the graphical display, of course, is that it makes it very clear visually what the relative sizes of these quantities are, and so this would be a bar graph for categorical data. So this was a bar graph for this frequency table of car colors. So now we're going to try to create something called a pareto chart. Now, a pareto chart is really the same idea as a bar graph, it's just a specific type of bar graph. So we're going to start it the same way: 5, 10,, 15,, 20,, 25,, 30,, 35,, 40.

You can look at a map and you can see that there's still forest there, but if you go back a few years, there was even a lot more forest. So it's constantly being cut off. Every place there is road, they're cutting the forest off. It may not be immediate, but within a few years it'll all be gone. So when they build a new road, it means the forest is gone. If you don't get there exactly when they build the road or before they build the road, you're not going to get anything. So they build the road and within months the trees are all gone. As far as you can see, they're growing either oil palm in the lowlands, or they're growing this naranjillo up in the highlands, or they're growing cacao in the lowlands. They're always cutting it off for some purpose and it doesn't last very long until the soils have become depleted and they have to abandon it. Now, when they abandon it, it regrows, but it just regrows in secondary growth, especially if they burned it. So there's nothing there. There's no seeds left, there are no sprouts, no seedlings or anything to regrow the forest. So generally it just ends up being a trash pile of weeds and grass and they try to raise cattle on it, but there's very little nutrients in the soil, so there's very little nutrients in the grass. Cows have to have hundreds of acres of ground to get the proper nutrients. It's not like in iowa where we grew cows.

Your testosterone or your adrenaline's higher, your heart rate's higher, everything your defense mechanisms are all higher. That stays like that until the stress is over or until you run out of you just can't carry it on any longer. And then what happens is it drops off the cliff. It drops off the cliff- i don't know if you saw my hands on that, i can't see myself- but it drops off the cliff and then you're, when you finish, you're lower than when you started.

So hybridization is kind of a big one, uh, that confuses a lot of people. So the basic idea behind hybridization is that you have atomic orbitals mixing together to form hybrid orbitals, and the advantage that the atoms enjoy when they form hybrid orbitals is that hybrid orbitals tend to overlap better with other atoms than just standard atomic orbitals do, right? So if you have a better overlap of orbitals, right, that's going to give you a lower potential energy, right, and so by forming hybrid orbitals, those central atoms like carbon can form more bonds to other atoms, and forming more bonds, uh, leads to a lower potential energy. And so you get, you know, s orbitals. Or you get the s orbital in a, in the uh energy level, mixing with p orbitals to produce hybrids. Right, if you have one s orbital and three p orbitals together, that'll give you four sp3 hybrids. If you have the s orbital combining with two p orbitals, you'll have three sp2 hybrid orbitals.

We only downloaded one variable. We'll look at kind of multivariate analysis soon enough. So again in our single quotes we go fed funds, so that creates kind of this basic plot. And there it is, so we can go ahead and copy this, select it, copy it right into your document. You're ready to go. Obviously we would want to add a lot to this.

It's a really clever piece of kit and it can increase the casualty's chance of survival anywhere up to around 75% if it's got to them within the first couple of minutes.

And because the ear says so, the beginning of the following tune is too loud, regardless of what the meter says. One solution is to try to increase the space between the tunes. Another solution is to slightly turn down the introduction of the next tune, just enough to reduce the disturbance on the ear, making sure that you can lead the listener on an upward journey through the next tune. This is why it is important to use meters, but not to depend on them. Your ears should always be your last port of call. Audio meter weaknesses because of the aural sensitivity. To contrast, a sudden burst of loud sound in the midst of soft sounds has a much greater impact than something of equal intensity in the middle of other loud sounds. No meter can make this type of loudness judgment or substitute for a set of trained audio engineer's ears. Also, meters do not take into account the listening sound pressure level. Our ears are not flat and, depending on how loudly we're listening, meters may over or underestimate our sensitivity of low frequency sounds. Audio meter strengths, however. Despite these shortcomings, meters are absolutely necessary. Our ears can be temporarily reset by listening to a loud passage for a long time, but a meter can help us verify that the soft part of an album is not too soft. Meters are very good at detecting a domino effect, wherein a tune becomes slightly louder than the previous one and the ear gets accustomed to the escalation. We must learn to work with the audio meter, to take advantage of its strengths and to understand its weaknesses. In general, audio metering has matured greatly. It is far more effective now than it has been since the time of dawn for audio recording.\",\n",

For example, the difference of the range is from a minimum of 29 years of age to a maximum of 73 years, and this, to you, refers to a distance or the difference between the minimum and the maximum, unlike the difference between population and sample mean. The difference between a variance for the population and a sample is that when you compute the population variance, denoted as sigma, squared you divided by the total number of observations, these are the deviations between observation and the mean squared, then added and then divided by the total number of observations. For sample variance, which is denoted as s squared, you divided by n minus one. The purpose of using n minus one is so that our estimate is unbiased in the long run. That means that if we take a second sample, we'll get a different value of s squared, if we take a third sample, we'll get a third value of s squared, and so on. We use n minus one so that the average of all these values of s squared is equal to sigma squared. We usually talk about squares called standard deviation rather than the variance. Standard deviation is essentially the square root of the variance or the variances in square units. So it's good to use the standard deviation because it's exactly the same units as the variable. The standard deviation of age will also be measured in years rather than years squared. Here you see that we just took the square root of variance and this becomes standard deviation. We will return to our data set and we'll look at the variables that we computed before. You can see that the standard deviation for beauty evaluation scores and age were computed with the descriptive statistics using the describe function in python.

Off-site construction offers many benefits. The factory environment provides a cleaner and safer place of work. Production is more efficient. Therefore, performances are enhanced. The factory environment guarantees higher quality, more predictable timescales, better performance with fewer defects and higher customer satisfaction. The optimized use of materials allows for reduction of waste. The application of building information modeling and automation allows for quality control through virtual reality and augmented reality. The design process for off-site construction systems can be described as front-loaded. With off-site construction, we often use an approach known as dfma. This is design for manufacturing and assembly. This includes manufacturing process and standard sizing limitations, dimensional tolerances of the chosen off-site system, transportation restrictions, supply chain, manufacturing capacity and site-specific restrictions. We have some examples of off-site construction from across the uk. Firstly, looking at a high-rise building in london known as the cheese grater, designed in 2014 by architects roger stark, harbour and partners, with arup being the engineers. The building was a combination of steel and concrete with highly prefabricated components manufactured in ireland and northern england. The superstructure was constructed in a very short time of approximately seven days per floor, 48 floors in total within 11 months. Moving north to glasgow, this mid-rise apartment building in earlesley road, it is the tallest timber building in scotland and was completed in 2017..

       "  'input_text': \"So what i've done there is just use two complementary colours and then, when they mix together, they create the grey. By surrounding saturated colours with grey, it gives me what is known as a contrast of saturations. If we go back to the work of henri matisse, matisse was considered as being revolutionary in his colour use. He was one of the founding artists of the movement of fauvism, fauvism deriving from the word wild beasts, and there were wild beasts of their colour use and they used non-literal colour, but the colour was all based on theories and balance. Now they used very saturated colour and the controlled use of saturated colour is very important. You can't just fire saturated colour onto a canvas or a design without consideration of what is being read next to. If you've ever wondered why the saturated colours, or really bright colours, look great in a black background or look great in a white background, it's because it's being read with a balance to something that doesn't have that has the least saturation. So saturated colours combined with unsaturated colours gives the saturated colours a little bit of a stage to perform on. Something's only hot when it's compared to something that's colder, and it's the same with colour. It's the same with painting, and this is what matisse told us. Matisse was working with colours from all around the colour wheel and high saturations, and as soon as he combined it with grey, blacks and whites, he was able to then stop bombarding the viewer with all this colour information and give a balance, a balance of saturations. The concept of complementary colours, creating grey, provides you with a way of creating those greys to break up your saturated colours. I've got this painting here that i produced recently, and it's all about this theory.\",\n",

You can totally apply this with a paintbrush and it works amazingly, but i decided to use an airbrush to expedite the process. Applying an even layer of this stuff over a large surface is very quick with an airbrush. And here's a disclaimer: this stuff is probably awful to breathe in. While i was doing this, i was wearing a respirator, i had an air purifier running, and i had a fan running in an area pointed at an open window. I hope that i appeased the youtube health police with this grand gesture of safety. Seriously, though, this is not water-based acrylic paint. You don't want to haphazardly spray it around. Once it was on and looked like it was dry, i began to dab it up with some more white spirits, and this makeshift sponge on a stick tool patent pending in an episode of trapped under plastic. My co-host, john, let me know about these eye makeup sponge things that are great for this operation, but i didn't have any, so i tried to make one, and you know what? It worked out great. The sponge was moistened with white spirits, not soaked in it. I mostly was swiping toward the recesses on the model, so the oil paint would collect there. After each part, i rinsed out the little sponge in more white spirits and proceeded, and it lasted the entire time. Good job, little sponge boy.\",\n",

Yes, animals are multicellular diploid organisms, and i'm using the abbreviation 2m to stand for diploid. Do we have any haploid cells in our bodies? Yes, we have the gametes. Our gametes are the only haploid cells, plants. They alternate. They alternate between a multicellular diploid stage called the sporophyte and a multicellular haploid stage called the gametophyte. So let's now look at it in more detail. First, let's take the animal life cycle. So we start out as a multicellular diploid organism. Special cells within this organism undergo meiosis. And what does meiosis produce? That's right, gametes, the haploid gametes. And you have both female and male gametes which will unite in fertilization to produce the diploid zygote. And then the zygote divides by mitosis into a baby and eventually the adult, and you make a new multicellular diploid organism which can begin this life cycle all over again. Now let's look at plants. So the plant multicellular diploid stage is the sporophyte, just like in animals, certain special cells can undergo meiosis, but this time meiosis produces haploid spores, not gametes. What is the difference? So both gametes and spores are haploid, but how are they different? Well, once you make gametes, can they divide again? No, once gametes are made, they're done spores, on the other hand, they can divide again.\",\n",

Having said all that, let's now talk about a few concepts that lie at the heart of accounting. Let's focus on understanding why it is we're going to be doing what we do when we finally get down to the nitty-gritty and begin working accounting problems. Accounting is viewed as being a pretty complicated area, but it's really, at heart, quite simple. The process of doing accounting involves keeping track of only two things: assets and equities. Since accountants keep track of assets and equities, we need to understand what they are. Let's look at the definition for assets. An asset is something that the business owns, and this generally means that the owner of the business holds legal title to the asset. An asset is something that is needed in order to operate the business and it's going to provide benefits to the business over a long period of time, not just today, but also tomorrow and the day after. Examples of assets would be things like buildings, furnishings in the building, such as shelving and carpet, and desks and chairs, and so on, equipment such as cash registers and office computers and adding machines, supplies such as paper and pencils and envelopes that are used in the office, and so on. These are all items that will benefit the business both today and tomorrow. Now, eventually, the supplies become used up and eventually the equipment becomes obsolete or wears away to the point that it can't be used anymore and eventually the building wears away and falls down. But as long as these items can still provide their benefits to the business, then they are assets.\",\n",

The music video became a new storage and distribution medium for new music. Conceptual music is in stark contrast to the idea of absolute music. It is the complete opposite of pure instrumental music. Sometimes, musical instruments are also deliberately destroyed. For this reason, conceptual music had no role in new music and was largely ignored and systematically excluded in the 20th centuries from the new music system. However, the digital revolution is not only a technological but also a social revolution and sets everything in motion, both in terms of the production, distribution and reception of music. An important aspect, among many others, is that digitalization also changes the structure of institutions. In principle, the digitalization of new music also leads to a deinstitutionalization of the new music system. Thus, it was only the dissemination of conceptual music via youtube that led to the subsequent inclusion of conceptual music in art music. Music institutions create prerequisites for the emergence of such a sophisticated cultural achievement as new music is the first most important institutional pillars of the new music system were, in the 20th century. First, the academy. This refers to all institutions where music is taught. The knowledge of notation, playing techniques, compositional techniques was, at least until recently, a kind of secret knowledge that could only be acquired within and not outside these institutions. A second institutional pillar is formed by the ensembles which perform art music. Music does not really exist if it exists only as a score. Thirdly, one of the most important music institutions was the publishing house that printed music scores. Fourthly, an essential institutional pillar in countries like germany is public broadcasting preparation, through which new music distributed, promoted and financially supported.',\n",

You'll see as we go along, there's actually necessary to be there. Some papers and textbooks put a two out front and i've seen some cases left out. But it is actually necessary, and you'll see why as we go along, it is necessary to have that form of half m, g, mu, nu and so on. Okay, so there's some, some papers and textbooks. Just put a two out front, but i'll just leave the half in front. It's a familiar form we used to. So our lagrangian then, if we expand all this out, becomes l as m on two times. This is the gtt term, gt phi term, the cross term, the r term, the grr, g theta theta and g phi phi term. Okay, so written all out with these coordinates. Okay, now the euler lagrange equation, given by the total derivative dd lambda of this object here, which is the partial derivative of the lagrangian with respect to the x dot coordinate minus tl, dx mu is zero, or the partial derivative of the lagrangian with the x mu coordinate.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': 'The score method was integrated into apex operations management body of knowledge framework and apex certifications to provide optimized supply chain management knowledge, best practices and performance. This brief history is important to show that score is a tool created by and for practitioners to improve their supply chains. Score uses best practices arising from real-world examples and research and is not an academic exercise. Score is a living document. There are numerous committees and teams that are rethinking, developing and researching information to continuously enhance the score model. Score provides a single integrated approach to supply chain improvement. A goal of the score framework is to assist supply chain management to solve business problems and improve processes and performance. Score attempts to accomplish this goal through four main techniques. First, to pursue continuous supply chain improvement by closely examining business processes and validating that they make sense. They are measured in score terms, to capture the as-is state and then to determine the desire-to-be state. Second, to compare supply chain performance to other supply chains at all levels and benchmarking like-for-like measures. Third, to examine existing supply chain practices and identify practices and technology solutions that result in significantly better performance. Score provides an easy-to-use basis for analysis to ensure the existing supply chain is starting out at least even with competitors. Finally, the score framework supports organizational design. Engaged in continuous learning and skills enhancement, and focused on performance, the score framework links process elements, metrics, practices and the requirements on staff operating the processes in a unique format. The uniqueness of the power of framework is chiefly derived from using these four elements together with a predefined relationship between processes. These predefined relationships are the result of research and collaboration in the development of score. This graphic illustrates the level one processes of all apics frameworks. Score is a part of this collection. These frameworks provide companies with a comprehensive set of tools to undertake supply chain improvements from several angles.',\n",

So i mean, if you've got a big enough saw, i mean because you can get saws that are, you know, four or five feet wide. So for me, like here's, here's the thing i would say too, because we keep talking about table saw and i'm going to say i love a table saw, but i think a table saw is best if used in a workshop, if you have a table built around it where you have an outfeed table and side feed tables, things that you can utilize to cut large pieces like, like big sheets of mdf or something of that nature. I agree, if you don't have the ability to handle a big piece of mdf, then it's not not that useful. You need a plenty of room for the outfeed. You do need side feed tables, and the table saw that i've been working off of it can do a 30 inch wide cut. But that thing you don't want to do, a 30 inch wide cut on that thing it's probably not safe. And i'll tell you the two i would say if people said: hey, what are the two, the two things that you need the most. If you're just getting in this industry, i would say: forgo all saws. First of all, because you can typically get home depot or lowe's or any big box store to cut it for you, alright, so if, if you can't afford a circular saw, which my first thought would be: go grab a cheap circular saw. You get one a yard sale for under 20 bucks typically. But then the two things you absolutely need is a sander.\",\n",

These two variables are examples of categorical variables and if we are comparing or trying to determine the correlation between two categorical variables, we would use the chi-square test. We would begin with a cross-tabulation between the two values. If we have two continuous variables, for example the teaching evaluation score and the beauty score of an instructor, then these are two continuous variables and they can assume any reasonable value within the range. In this case we use a pearson correlation test. We usually begin with a scatter plot to see what's the nature of the relationship between the two variables. Let us start with categorical variables. We will use the chi-square test for association. First we state our hypothesis. We will test the null hypothesis that gender and tenureship are independent against the alternative hypothesis that they are associated. Let's begin with a cross-tabulation between gender- male and female- and tenure- that is, tenured profs- then followed by a chi-square test. So we do the tabulations. In the rows we have tenured no versus tenured yes and female instructors and males. We would like to eyeball these numbers before we turn them into percentages. Looking at instructors who are non-tenured, we notice that 50 of the instructors are female versus 52 who are male. But for the instructors who are tenured, 145 of them are female and 216 of them are male. So within the tenured group we see greater probability for males to be tenured, but in the untenured group the distribution between males and females looks similar.

You're going to need an accountant. Now, you don't have to hire us, you can hire in house. So we're going to talk about that. If you hire in house, who should you get? Because there's a lot of options and there's a lot of different budgets out there that you need to be aware of so that you don't get the wrong person for the wrong job description. Okay, the first person you're going to hire is your bookkeeper. Now this is the data entry specialist. Depending on where you live, you're going to pay a different amount for this person. So if you live in idaho, for example, you might be on the lower end, around $18,000 to $20,000 a year. But if you're in new york or california, you could be upwards of $40,000 or even $45,000 a year. So know that this person serves a specific role. They're not going to be strong in creating reports for you or doing business analytics or accounting processes. Their job is to get data into the system and if you're a new entrepreneur, this is likely you. You've been doing this yourself. So this is a good option to offload some of the heavy kind of, you know, grunt work of accounting and allow you to begin analyzing some of the reports. A good hire for anybody that is ready to expand their business but not really ready to invest in the high, top tier accountants just yet. The next level up guys is the accountant. Now, a lot of people think bookkeepers and accountants are the same thing.\",\n",

Different tissue types come together to form organs. This brings us to the organ level of our anatomical organization. Organs provide specific functions in the body. For example, the brain is the control center of the body. It receives sensory input, integrates information and sends motor commands. The heart is an organ that functions to pump the blood through the blood vessels. The kidneys are organs that filter the blood and make urine. The lungs function to inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. The stomach is an important organ for digestion. Organs work together in the body in a cooperative fashion as organ systems. This brings us to the organ systems level of our anatomical organization. The human body has 12 organ systems, each of which contains several specific organs working together to perform specific functions in the body. These include the digestive system, the integumentary system, the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the skeletal system, the muscular system, the immune system, the lymphatic system, the endocrine system, the reproductive system and the urinary system. The digestive system functions to absorb nutrients from the foods we eat and to eliminate indigestible waste. Ingested food must be broken down and processed to make nutrients available for the tissues. The portion that is not digested is eliminated from the body in the form of feces. The integumentary system includes the skin, hair, nails and exocrine glands. The integumentary system forms the external body covering and protects deeper tissues from injury. It houses important touch, pain and temperature receptors, along with sweat glands and oil glands. The nervous system allows for fast, specific communication between the body and the brain.',\n",

First of all, when you are just six, seven month old and you had some sort of stress, what do you do? You cry. Your mom puts you with her breast nipple is in your mouth and you feel great. Your stress is gone. Is that true or not? Now you are adult, grown up, adult, intelligent, but still your unconscious mind is same. So some of you even go under stress.

You can see it here in the sagittal diagram and the tongue is just just touching right behind the the teeth and that's your alveolar ridge right there. So we have a lot of alveolar sounds in english. That's to do mmm, oh and er, all right. Then we have velar sounds. Velar sounds are gonna take place in the back of your mouth and so, with the other sounds, you're using the front tip of your tongue. This one is gonna have the body or the back of your tongue going up against your velum, which is towards the back of your mouth, and we have three velar sounds in english. That's good. And being like at the word end of the word song, right? That's not two different letters, that's not an n and a g combined, that's one sound it's. And that's just an example of a few different places of articulation we have in english. There are more and there are other places that are not used in english, but i just wanted to give you the main ones in this video. The next criteria that we need to know about in order to describe speech sounds is manner of articulation, and that just has to do with how the air is passing through your vocal tract. Place of articulation talks about where in your mouth the constriction is taking place.\",\n",

I haven't had a chance to actually try it yet, but just watching the amount of effort that the creator, jared sumner, is putting into it, he's put a crazy amount of attention to detail in identifying things that are slow, such as copying files and extracting them during installation or websocket message handling or http request serving and things like that, and has done a ton of optimization work to make that stuff fast. Does this guarantee that the tool is going to be a massive success? No, and the fact that it is a one-person effort so far is a little bit scary, but the fact that someone actually has taken the time to put in that much effort to try to make a new alternative javascript runner, bundler, transpiler, package installer- swiss army knife- is really very impressive and it has a lot of potential.\",\n",

Lovely, really nice, fantastic, okie, dokie, cool. Don't forget to ask questions if you do have them, but otherwise we will keep pushing on. Okay, so this is an example question. It's a past paper question about mass spectrometry. So it says: the copper used to make a batch of coins is analysed by mass spectrometry. The mass spectrum is shown below: calculate the relative atomic mass of the copper used to make the coins. Give your answer to two decimal places. So we basically got to do exactly the same thing, the one thing that i will do just to be sure, and you can assume that they aren't trying to trip you up- but i will just make sure that my percentages add up, because if they don't, there may have been a bit of information in the question that i've missed, telling me about a third isotope or something like that. So, because it only takes me half a second, i'm just going to check: do those numbers add up? Yes, they do. Great, that's fine. So i'm happy that i'm only using these values here. I haven't missed anything in the question. It's a nice quick check. So anybody got a value for me then. So we're calculating relative atomic mass. It's the same as we did before. It's the sum of the abundance times by what we're assuming is the exact mass divided by 100. That looks good. So don't forget to keep the numbers associated with each other. So 69.17% of the coins have a mass of 63.\",\n",

It's probably because of the calcium channel blocker- super common, see it all the time. Now the other one that we see when we use diltiazem or especially verapamil. Verapamil by itself usually causes what verapamil we see causes: constipation. That's another side effect. We've got the little cortcon toilet here inside of our image and gingival hyperplasia.

Today we think that our perfection and the sparkle that it brings to a stone is worth the trade-off for some lost carrots. Losing a few carrots to get a sparklier stone is a worthwhile transaction for what it's worth. This pink stone is the agra diamond, which was a 16th century golconda stone purchased by the duke of brunswick and a big part of my original research, and it's got a crazy origin story involving an interolith and a horse and some soldiers. Check it out. Another advance worth mentioning is that there was a change in thinking about how to house these new brilliant cut stones. Ferdinand herpers was a jewelry setting manufacturer in newark, new jersey, which was a hotbed of jewelry setting manufacturing, and he patented his improvement in diamond setting in 1872. And then eight years later, sold that patent to charles tiffany.\",\n",

It is built on numpy, scipy and matplotlib. Statsmodels is also a python module that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models and perform statistical tests. Now let's get into statistics. Thanks for watching. Welcome to statistics. In this module, we will explain how statistics surround our daily lives. All we have to do is to think of the conversations we have on a regular basis. A day start with this concern about rain or snow, we turn to the weather channel to see whether it will rain or snow today or tomorrow. When the weather channel informs you that the chance of rain is 35% or 60%, you are essentially relying on statistical tools and technologies to come up with those forecasts so that you may be better prepared for either rain or snow. If you happen to live in a large city in north america or europe, in east asia, housing affordability is likely to be a concern, and when you hear in the news media that housing is becoming more expensive over time, this analysis is coming out of statistical analysis. At the same time, you will hear if the unemployment rate has fallen or has risen over time, or how millennials are looking for jobs that may not be full-time, and when we track those numbers over time, we realize we are using statistics. Statistics are not just confined to economics. We appreciate players based on their performance and we judge their performance using statistics. Millennials and the sharing economy is perhaps redefining the way we understand economics and business these days. The way millennials have defined their preferences, different from previous generations, is something of interest. Many say that they would like to rent than to own a house. That didn't used to be the case in the past, but the norms are changing.\",\n",

The roots of biochemistry go way back into the 1700s or 1800s, where people first started thinking about the reason that cells were alive and other things weren't alive. And, by the way, anything that you're responsible for today, i will tell you. So i'm just kind of blithering and blathering about things today just to kind of get the mood set. Okay, so when they first started thinking about biochemistry, the term didn't exist, of course, but they were very curious about what separated living systems from other systems. Okay, why is a cell alive and a rock is not? Okay, and that's a philosophical question at one level, but it's also a very practical and a biochemical question at another level. Okay, thinking about what was it that made an organism alive is something that probably has permeated all of human history. Okay, we had this notion, or people had a notion for a long time, that human beings were something that was very different from the rest of the living world. But one of the things i think- and i hope that you'll learn this term- is that human cells are really no different than anybody else. You're going to be astonished to see how similar in- not necessarily structure, but how similar in organization- human cells are to bacterial cells. The simplest bacterium on the face of the earth has much more similarity to your cells than you would ever imagine. Okay, people didn't know that at the time. A bacterium doesn't look anything like a human cell. In fact, back in the beginning of time, people didn't know bacteria existed.\",\n",

So be careful of this. On the test of the question on the exam were to say: who will investigate complaints against licensees? The commissioner. Prosecution for a violation of the real estate law, of course, is done by the district attorney. So i'll give you an example of this. Let's say that i'm your real estate agent and i steal $10,000 from you. Now, of course, you're gonna be pissed because i took 10 grand from you, as you should be, and you're gonna complain about me to the real estate commissioner. Now, initially, the real estate commissioner will investigate that complaint. Now, if it's true, ultimately, that i did steal $10,000 from you, i should say: do you think i should be jailed for stealing $10,000 from you? Of course i should go to jail. Right, i stole from you 10 grand. So who's going to ultimately prosecute me? That's going to be the da. So be careful of this distinction.

If they're not essential, if your study has a very long title already, you want to get rid of these, because the longer your title, the harder it is to search for. Don't use questions or complete sentences in the title. A phrase is often the best way to go. Don't use abbreviations in your title. There are some exceptions to this, such as if you are using an acronym that is widely known, interdisciplinary, such as dna, but otherwise don't use too specific abbreviations within the title. Save that for after the abstract. You want to narrow the scope of what is in your paper. So if you have a paper that is about the gastrointestinal diseases in 70-year-olds in seville, spain, writing a title that reads disorders of the stomach in elderly spanish people is too broad. Right, it's definitely too broad for what your paper is about. So you need to keep it narrow. But you also want to use keywords that other researchers will use. So the balance of narrowing your scope and using general keywords to have a greater chance of hitting upon your manuscript in the database is the real trick of the title, and one way to do that is to put important terms at the beginning and at the end of your title. So if you have a case study at the beginning, it's less likely to get a hit. If you have the content, the real focus of your study at the beginning, it's easier to see and it's more likely to result in a keyword hit. And last on this list again, research, the journal database. You really need to do your homework before you submit to any publication.

You can probably think of a time when you were involved in a conversation and you're communicating with somebody, but not really. You're kind of going through the motions, you have your mind somewhere else, you're thinking about something, you're preoccupied and although you're physically present, mentally you are absent and that obviously is an obstacle or barrier to effective communication. In addition, you also have issues with education. You know, if you're communicating with someone who is of higher education or less, you do have to take that into account, because if you're sending the message, you do want to make sure that the person can understand it. So if you're going to communicate to a group of elementary school students, it's probably going to look different than if you communicate to a group of college students, because you have to take into account the knowledge and educational level of the audience, and so, from a receiver standpoint, if you're interpreting a message, then that could also be a deterrent to effective communication. You've probably been involved in a high school setting or in a college classroom and a professor or instructor is lecturing on a particular set of material and you're sitting there not understanding a word they are saying and maybe, just maybe, that's because the person communicating isn't doing so with the actual audience in mind.

And we're also going to see how future punishment induces cooperative behavior. Today this relates directly to the concept of the prisoner's dilemma and repeated prisoner's dilemmas, and we'll see that in action. Then we'll actually start talking about more specific things. We'll get to the big big thing, that sort of overtook international relations in 1995, which was an article by a professor at stanford named james fearon, who wrote an article called rationalist explanations for war, and he just asked a very simple question: if war is costly, why can't states settle their differences at the bargaining table, given that it's going to cost both sides something to fight a war? And in this article he lays out this big research question and then provides a few answers. He talks about preventative war and preemptive war and how asymmetric information, incentives to misrepresent, can cause war and issue indivisibility. So we'll talk about this war's inefficiency puzzle, as it's termed now, and how these four things at the bottom of the bullet points can lead to states fighting over conflicts rather than bargaining over them.\",\n",

You can imagine breathing into this region and breathing out from this region, not trying to change the sensations, but trying to see them more clearly.

In the classical period, sonatas became standardized as a three-movement genre and each movement had specific forms to follow. A good example of a typical sonata from this period is mozart's sonata no 10 for piano k 330.. This sonata takes place over three movements with a fast allegro, moderato, first movement. A slow andante, cantabile, second movement and another fast allegretto, third movement. Let's look at the movements from the sonata in greater detail. The first movement of the sonata is in the classical version of sonata allegro form, which developed out of the rounded binary form of the baroque period. The classical sonata allegro form has an aba outline with the first a section, called the exposition, consisting of a first theme that's composed in the primary key of the piece, a second theme written in the dominant or relative major key and then a conclusion back in the tonic key. The entire exposition then repeats and enters the b section, called the development, where the themes are manipulated and played with in various ways and through various other keys. Finally, we return to the a section material in the last section, the recapitulation, which is altered harmonically to land on a final cadence in the home key. In classical period sonata allegro form, the development and recapitulation are repeated as shown in the diagram here. For more on sonata form, check out the article what is sonata form on the liberty park music blog. The second movement from the sonata is slow and song-like, with the marking cantabile or singable, as is expected from the second movements of sonatas.\",\n",

And, to go back a slide, it comes back to that idea for a fair hearing as well. When you have a fair hearing, you should also have reasons given for a particular decision at the end of that fair hearing. So before we come to the end of this and move on to remedies, i want to talk a little bit about human rights, because i think this is maybe an area that you could gain some extra marks on in an exam question or in a coursework. It's something that students tend to forget about, because it is still a relatively new phenomenon within the area of judicial review and a key section of the human rights like 1998. here is section 6.1. That says it's unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a convention right, and so it's something to bear in mind, especially thinking back to procedural impropriety. We can think about the right to a fair hearing, and that links very closely to article 6 of the european convention on human rights, and so if you don't think that there's been a fair hearing or reasons haven't been given for a decision, then definitely mention article 6, because it is an important consideration and, as we can see from section 6.1, it's something that the courts ought to take into consideration, that public bodies should be taking into account people's convention rights.\",\n",

When i moved to dc, the project started in earnest and once i had a working prototype, luke ordered 50 more iphones so that we could have 100..

You have no idea what i'm talking about, okay, so when you find the area, the square foot of your house, that's how wide. It is not wide, but length and width. It's the total measurement of the inside of the house. Okay, so you're finding how big it is, not the measurement around it, because you could have a. oh, it's, the perimeter of our house is 200 feet. Well, it could be a straight line. You could just be walking through a hallway. Okay, with area, you can see all that. Well, i guess it could still be the same thing, but area's better for square footage, okay, if you don't understand what i'm talking about, talk to your mom, okay, or your dad. I have no idea what they're talking about, all right. So the formula for area, as we're using formulas, it is: length times width equals your area. Okay, all i do is plug in what i have for length, which is 15 inches times my width, which is 7 inches. All right, now we just multiply 7 times 15, which is 70, times 5,, which is 105, and then when you do inches times inches, you do the little thing called inches squared, because we don't know, we don't want to put in what inches it is. We want to put inch squared because it gives us our form of measurement: equals area.\",\n",

So g, phi, phi here times phi dot, and that's equal to a constant constant h. now this component, the particles for momentum, is conserved along geodesics. And there's another killing vector in the direction of the phi coordinate and so this is a conserved quantity along the geodesic, so particle following along the geodesic, but only this component of full momentum is conserved. The total for momentum involves the other angular coordinate and the variables t and r, and that is not conserved. The total angular momentum is not conserved. Remember, there are no purely radial paths in there. These particles for momentum will change angular- sorry, this particles angular momentum will change due to the inertial frame dragging effect. Okay, so p phi is mu phi, m on 2 g phi, t, ut plus m on 2 g, phi, phi, u, phi.

You've got it ready to use for your problem. So we can think of machine learning really in two categories. So there's classical machine learning. Classical machine learning supposes a model from heuristics or statistics. It extracts features that have been put together by experts. It learns a mapping from a representation that's controlled directly. So imagine changing the parameters of a model and really doing some tuning of knobs. That's how you can kind of get value out of this model. It's usually a low cost solution and a great first approach. But really where we've been moving in the past decade has been deep learning. So that's really data driven learning. So imagine these two steps of feature extraction and applying a model within this box being done for you. So this supposes a model based on learning directly from the data for a task or a set of tasks and that's multitask learning. But we don't have to talk about that and get too deep there. But these features are automatically computed from the data and these can lend to improving task performance. So the examples i showed previously of change detection and doing image registration. We're really learning features from the data and applying that model all in one step. We're not having to extract features, figure out what features are good or bad, throw them out. Go pick a model, figure out what model is good or bad, throw it out. We're doing these two steps together, which can really help. But there are some cons. It can balloon in cost because having to use gpus and cloud resources and kind of go down the search of what model and how to train the model can be difficult.\",\n",

So we have, say, classical bits. So if you're sort of like struggling to imagine something that fits into this. Imagine we have some mirrors, we shine some very faint light into this collection of mirrors, the light bounces around the mirrors, and then we have a photon detector somewhere, something that just detects light, and this detector just clicks or doesn't click. Now that's actually a surprisingly good representation for very many situations in experimental physics, and the information you get when you measure light, or, in particular, is a photon there or not, is a click or a no-click. In fact, it turns out that all the observables that quantum mechanics will give you predictions about are of that form: does event a happen or not happen? So that's why probability theory will play a role in terms of preparation here. Usually there's some information required to describe the preparation of your experiment. So we have a list of variables, a1 through to am. These are also classical bits. You can just take your information that describes the setup of your apparatus and express it as a list of bits as well. So what you should be seeing here is a picture where classical information is used to create a preparation for your experiment. The experiment proceeds and then there's a measurement and out comes classical information, and so that's all experiments that we try and describe in physics. If you work hard enough, you can reduce them to this abstract form here, and so the goal of quantum mechanics is to describe the probability that we get a given outcome given a certain income. So this is to predict the probability, because we can't.\",\n",

Does this guarantee that the tool is going to be a massive success? No, and the fact that it is a one-person effort so far is a little bit scary, but the fact that someone actually has taken the time to put in that much effort to try to make a new alternative javascript runner, bundler, transpiler, package installer- swiss army knife- is really very impressive and it has a lot of potential.\",\n",

The resulting project is an app and server called multiphone that links all 100 iphones together and turns them into a giant video screen, a chess board, a deck of cards and more. You can check out my video explaining exactly how the app works. I'm really proud of it. This project is another example of starting small and working my way up. When i first had the idea, i didn't even know if it was going to be possible. These phones are pretty old, so i'd have to figure out what version of xcode i needed to use and see if i could even build and run apps on these old phones. Once i got that figured out, i had to make sure that the phones could communicate with the server in reasonably close to real time. Once all of the experimentation was done and i felt confident that i could build the app, i worked on one feature at a time until i had enough features to call the project finished and make a video on it.

       "  'input_text': \"This is the idea of monetary policy. Again, this is called the money market graph and it shows you the supply and demand for money and it sets the nominal interest rate. But there's another graph you have to know, called the loanable funds market, which sets the real interest rate. This graph shows the demand of loans set by borrowers and the supply of loans set by savers. The main difference between the money market graph and the loanable funds market is that this one focuses on the short run and sets the nominal interest rate, whereas this one focuses on the long run and sets the real interest rate. Now, of course, there's more to it than that, but i'm not gonna cover it now. Instead, if you wanna learn more about that, take a look in the link in the description. One of the things you gotta know about the loanable funds market is that changes here can affect the economy in the long run. For example, assume that foreigners wanna put a lot of money into your economy. That would increase the supply of loanable funds and decrease the real interest rate. That means that consumers and businesses are gonna take out more loans. It's gonna increase consumer spending and investment. More investment means more factories and tools and physical capital, so we can produce more than we did before. So a decrease in the real interest rate means there's an increase in business spending and investment. So aggregate demand goes up and because we have more tools, aggregate supply goes up and that means we also have an increase in the long-run aggregate supply. The economy is growing. This shows the idea of economic growth and of course, you can show that same concept on the production possibilities curve. When the long-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, we can produce more than we ever could before. That's like this curve shifting outward, making points over what's impossible possible.\",\n",

Please don't feel like you have to necessarily have them all in this order. You know the criteria is that it needs to be in a logical order. This is just to make sure that you've included everything. Now it makes sense to begin with your hypothesis and to talk about whether it was supported or not based on your results. Don't put figures in. Don't put data in. You need to refer to the figures or tables that you included in your results. You can also talk about the degree to which it addresses the hypothesis. You can say supported, not supported, but you can say you know it's supported to some degree, or it's supported but maybe the difference in the results aren't significant enough to strongly support the hypothesis. Show the little nuances there in your understanding. You then need to evaluate the sample and talk about the size and the representativeness of that sample and really being specific about, for your particular research question or your hypothesis, what factors are going to be most relevant. Obviously, every sample could always be bigger, but try and talk about things. It might be gender, it might be age, but pick something that's relevant for your particular focus. Really important.

But this is like just to show the concept here, and you can see that if you have a regular one-dimensional array, there's a fixed relationship between the transmit and receive angle, the receiving angle and the transmitting angle that is determined and controlled by the time delay of each one of the elements. So if you program each one of these elements for a given phi tx and phi rx to this value, you will indeed receive a signal from a direction and retransmit it in a different direction, which is programmable. Now by controlling and reprogramming the tm you can actually change that direction. So this picture basically shows a picture on the left shows that this pattern is this. So basically what you have here, you know that shows in this example. Yet you have a receive pattern which shows how effectively power is received, and the transmit pattern that basically shows that how effectively the power that's received is retransmitted in a different direction. So in this example we are receiving from negative 30 degree and retransmitting to plus 60 degree and in this example we are doing a one-dimensional array actually here to simplify the situation. So you can actually see that it's an eight-branch array that receives in one direction. So you can think about it as a programmable mirror, so you actually can bounce it in a desired direction and you can imagine this could be useful because you can imagine an environment where there's a large number of these in the same environment and by receiving and retransmitting signal you can actually route it through different pathways and get it to places where we basically do not have visibility.\",\n",

Pretty much no matter how long the nail is, you can get it out with the quickripper. It doesn't matter if the nail is mangled or headless. In fact, it's got enough gripping force that you can actually grab the pointed end of the nail, pull it right through a corner. It doesn't matter if the head is there or not. The quickripper helps everybody with several different tools. It replaces a lot of tools that you would normally have to carry around, things like locking pliers, a bar, a crowbar, a hammer. It replaces several tools at once, so you don't have to hunt for another tool when the one you have won't do the job, because the quickripper does them all. It can actually help you repurpose wood. You can take old boards off the deck and pull all the nails off, no matter how embedded that head is. You just grab the little thing and pull it through. It works really well. You can reuse all those boards. It works great for trim, because trim always uses those little tiny brass that are hard to get out. You can't get out until you get it back. You can just grab it from the back side and pull it right through. It saves everybody time, no matter what they're brought to. The quickripper was designed to be used by everybody, from professionals down to your own.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"In linux, processors write to standard out. Standard out is the default file descriptor that processors can write to. Instead of writing logs to a file, it goes to standard out. This prevents the disk from getting full and provides simple, standardized logic in our apps to send logs to standard out. When processors run in containers, the container runtime gathers all these standard out logs and manages them for us. The container runtime takes care of the lifecycle of these logs. So let me demonstrate this. If i run a container, let's say i say docker, run redis and i run a redis container. Look what happens now. Because i'm running the container with the minus it flag, docker picks up all these standard out logs and prints it to the terminal. You can see all the redis logs are shown here. If i open up another terminal and i say docker ps, you can see we have redis running. I can go ahead and grab the container id and i can say docker logs with the container id and i can get the same logs. We can see the container runtime collects all the standard out logs for each container. Now, remember, a container is just a process. So if i ran redis on top of linux without a container, i would see exactly the same thing. This is because, if we look at the documentation, by default docker logs shows the commands output just as it would have appeared if the command ran interactively in the terminal. So whether it's running in a container or not, it's going to behave the same. Docker picks up all the logs from standard out and standard error. So if docker is by default writing all the container logs to standard out, how do we access those?\",\n",

They do not extend forever and ever in both directions like lines do. The following are examples of line segments: the line segment on the left can be denoted as ab or segment ba. Notice that we add a segment on top of the letters in order to distinguish it from that of a line which contains arrows in both ends. Also, notice that a segment is named in terms of its two end points, because a segment has a definite beginning and end. The figure in the middle contains two line segments. The vertical up and down segment can be called rs or segment sr. once again, we usually denote them in alphabetical order. The horizontal, crosswise or from left to right can be named as segment st or segment ts. In the following number line, the segment whose end point is located at the coordinate of negative 1 and 1 is denoted as line segment bd or segment db. Likewise, a segment that has a coordinate at negative 2 and 2 is denoted as segment ae or segment ea. So we learned about lines which extend forever and ever in both directions, and we learned about segments which have a definite length and do not go on forever and ever. Is it possible to create a figure that contains both of these characteristics? The answer is yes. These hybrids are called rays. Rays, like lines and segments, are made up of points and are straight. A ray differs from a line or segment in that it begins at an end point and then extends infinitely far in one direction only. Segments extend in two directions. Rays extend in one direction only, so make sure you keep that in mind. The following are examples of rays.',\n",

In order to get prime display space, coke may have a promotion. For example, have a coke with someone today and the novelty of the packaging gives the intermediary incentive for that prime display space and, in that way, pushing the product out to more consumers. Point of sale displays and discounts are also push strategies. In the case of a discount at the point of sale, the consumer is being offered a incentive that forces more volume through the channel. In the case of the point of sale display, both the intermediary and often the consumer gets an incentive to purchase more product pull. Promotional tools work differently. Promotional advertising reminds consumers that there might be a different, exciting, short-term reason to return to the outlet- in this case mcdonald's because of their sponsorship with avatar- and in that way draws the consumer back into the outlet so that they purchase more of the offering. Branding is a very important. Although this is an older logo for apple, we're all familiar with the icon, with the mark and because of this, when apple launches a new product, the strength of the brand itself draws people to retail stores, apple stores, online- to purchase the product because they're drawn to the brand word of mouth. Another word for that is referrals. When a small business or a large business has a referral program where they give an incentive to their current customers to refer new customers, that's drawing in new customers to that business. In this case, you're using your best advocates, which are your happiest customers. Relationship marketing is a large area in and of itself.\",\n",

You also want to completely remove them from society. A lot of people make the argument that the death penalty is about general deterrence. Oh well, i mean, if they see that they're going to get death penalty, they're not going to do that crime. Quite honestly, having worked in the criminal justice system for a long time. I feel like people that are going to commit crimes that are worthy, that are bad enough, severe enough for the death penalty or life in prison, are not the kind of people who sit around saying, oh well, if i commit this crime i'm going to go and i go to jail. They don't. Either they don't think they're going to get caught or they really don't care if they get death penalty. They're not thinking about it during the commission of the crime or just prior to the commission of the crime. They're only thinking about the crime.

You know you should have initiative with purpose. There is no purpose in flushing the watch and it should not be done by this baby. You are understanding now, baby who is developing, person who is developing on the positive side. In first year of life he developed to be the strength of hope. Then, during autonomy, he learned willpower and determination. And during initiative versus guilt, baby developed that whatever initiative should be taken, it should be taken with a purpose and courage. So these are the positive strengths which you are developing in your personality. If you are developing on this side, you are developing very sad type of personality, weak type of personality. You don't trust people with little problems, you become hopeless. On this side, you are always not sure, you are doubtful about your capabilities and you are not willing to take initiative, because whatever initiative you took in your childhood you felt guilty. So this will be strong personality or weak personality on this side. Weak personality, is that right? No problem up to this. And another thing i want to tell that if autonomy is pathologically too much, if parents make you too much autonomous in early life, that is also dangerous. People who are made autonomous too much at early stage, when they grow up they develop a problem and problem is impulsivity. They become impulsive. You know what is impulsivity?

If you understand the basics of algebra, you're going to notice the rest of your algebra life throughout high school is going to be very easy. I've assessed too many students and in year 9 and 10, they come and i notice their problem is that it's not the year 9, nor the year 10 work, nor the year 11 work. It's actually the basics of not understanding algebra. Today i'm going to spend some time going through a lot of the examples, just so you can understand algebra very well. Algebra is used to simplify mathematical problems. We like to make things simple. You'll notice a lot in maths where the question says simplify or write your answers in simplified form. So it's very important. We understand algebra very well. You're going to notice it is easy. Once you get the hang of it, you'll become very fast. Let's go through some of the rules. In algebra, when we have a multiplication, it's basically invisible. So looking at these examples here, in these diagrams, m times n- it is the same as mn. So all we do is get rid of the multiplication m times n, meaning mn. We also have 4 times b. Now, b is a number but we don't know what it is. So 4 times b is exactly the same as 4b. So we don't write it as 4 times b, we write it as 4b. We're going to do more examples, but now just go through the theory division. When we have an example of g divided by 7, we write it in fraction form.\",\n",

The second thing that you get when you're a realtor is you get something called zipforms, and zipforms is a contract generation software. So when somebody says, hey, i want to sell my house or i want to buy that house, you don't just open up microsoft word and start typing up a letter to the owner. You have preprinted forms. You get access to those forms and that library by becoming a realtor. The third thing that you get- that's important- is you get a suprakey. Now a suprakey is an electronic key that opens up lockboxes that have keys for the homes that are for sale in them. So those are the three big things that you get when you're a realtor. You get mls access, you get zipforms and you get a suprakey to open up property. Now should you ever lend your suprakey out? Under no circumstances. Under no circumstances should you let someone else use your suprakey, because any time that key accesses a lockbox that leaves a thumbprint on the box. So if something comes up missing and that report is run on the box, it's going to show that you accessed that, not the knucklehead that you let borrow your key. So make sure you never- and by the way, it's against the terms of service for supra also- to let someone else use your key.

They admit that this would not be a reality anytime soon, but nonetheless they want to be ready when space tourism and other out-of-this-world opportunities begin to take off. While we still haven't found intelligent life on other planets, you can imagine that if we did, there would be plenty of people wanting to do business with them. These foreign planets would represent untapped markets for your products and services. For instance, let's say you are a successful watchmaker and that your watches are sold all over planet earth. If it were a possibility, there are three main reasons why you might want to start selling beyond earth. First, you have been doing well, but because there are no new areas to expand, your business is not growing. However, one day in your intergalactic travels, you find a planet whose inhabitant lifeforms are, as you like to call them, aliens. They tell time using pocket watches, but no one uses wristwatches. Part of the reason could be that they don't really have wrists that are smaller than their hands. The idea of putting something on their wrist every time they put their arm down seems rather absurd. However, you see a potential growth opportunity. While the exact watches you produce may not be suitable for this population, you realize that with some slight modifications, using the incredibly advanced technology of spandex that you already use in some of your watches on earth, the watches could stay attached to the aliens' wrists. If you are successful in entering this planet's market, as well as atmosphere, then you might be able to grow yourselves.\",\n",

But still, if i want to have continuous deployment, i need to set up the azure pipelines. So let's go to. I'm going to leave that for now. Let's go to azure.

You will decide that, in spite of many troubles in new relations, it's worth it. Let me give you an example. Let's suppose in your class there is a girl who's very positive minded and unfortunately she gets a boyfriend who's negatively developing. Now girl who is very positive minded, what she will do? She is in a big test in relationship. But if she has developed in positive way- then boyfriend is not behaving in a good way, she will be still hopeful. She will have a true willpower to change him according to her wishes. Right, she will work on that purpose. She will develop new skills to tame that boyfriend and even when boyfriend is fooling around she will remain loyal. And one day boyfriend will say, oh, my girlfriend really loves me, is that right? But if she's developed in negative way, when boyfriend become a little bit less interested in her, she will become hopeless. She will not have will and determination to continue the relationship in spite of some trouble. She will never work with a special purpose- how to improve this particular relationship. She is not interested to develop new skills for this particular relationship and she will also become disloyal. Do you think that love can go far? No, so all these things will now determine that either your mind will decide your emotional circuits in your mind will decide that intimacy is worth it in spite of all problem. Or if you are a person who are unfortunately weaker in personality, with little little trouble in intimate relation, you will say: this is a hopeless situation, i cannot win over there and you start getting isolated. So it means that if the person who is positively developing, he has a stronger capacity of intimacy.\",\n",

So, basically, in your company, go through every project that you have, assign one of those rs for every project that you can, and then create a plan out of this. Next step is initial organization alignment. During this, when the plan is being established, you want to meet with the key stakeholders in your organization to make sure that everyone is aligned and every key person supports this adoption plan. During this step- the alignment of people who will make this plan a reality is very important. It is also a step where you map your people to the capabilities so you know who should be engaged when and once your organization is aligned, you will create skills readiness plan. During this stage, you want to review your current skill sets in your company and create a plan that will address the gaps, because in the cloud, you will need to have a lot of new skills in your company across different teams and different people, and this plan will take care of that. And once you do all those things, simply put it into so-called cloud adoption plan. This plan will be used to manage the change across your digital estate skills and the organization and the processes. To summarize, in the planning stage, we want to create actionable plan for our cloud adoption. From there we move to the next stage, called ready. So readiness stage is all about preparing your first azure environment. To do that, you start with azure setup guide, so you read azure documentation on how the initial environment should look like.\",\n",

This process can be repeated for each root note. For example, drawing in all the white notes from d to d results in what's called a dorian scale. But if you're just starting off, i'd recommend sticking with only major and minor scales for now. Chords- chords are multiple notes played in harmony at the same time. The most common type of chord consists of three notes and therefore is called a triad. A chord is named after its root note and its quality. For example, this is a c-major chord. An easy way to remember how to make major chords is to pick your root note and draw in another note four semitones above that, and then finally one more three semitones above that note, or a total of seven above your root. Another, even quicker way to remember major triads is to draw in a major scale using the trick previously described. Let's pretend i want to be in f-major. Now pick any note to be the root of my chord, let's say a-sharp from here. Draw in a note at every other key in the scale moving upwards. In this case we skip over c, the next highest note in the f-major scale. Draw in a note at d, skip over e and draw in a note at f. for this reason the major chord is referred to having the pattern of 1-3-5,, since our root is the first note and from here we use the third and fifth notes in the scale respectively, we now have an a-sharp major chord and, just like magic, it also follows the pattern we previously described, where the gap between the root and the second note is four semitones and the gap between the root and the third is seven.\",\n",

This is in fact how a modern four colour printing press works, by placing tiny dots of pure colour next to each other to create an image in the eye. The process is just too taxing for most artists, though, so pointillism as a movement didn't last for very long. Post-impressionists like paul gauguin and van gogh learned the techniques of the impressionists, but began to use colour in a more emotional manner. They were less concerned with the actual appearance of light and atmosphere than with emphasising the beauty of pure colour and line in a fairly flat picture plane. Van gogh felt that colours had symbolic meaning to him: yellow symbolised love and light, red and green conveyed passion and conflict. Deep blue was the colour of spiritual rest and grey was associated with surrender. Paul cézanne's later work can be seen as one of the bridges between the art of the 19th century and the 20th century. He used colour almost as a chisel to shape objects, where he enjoyed the contrast of greyed colour with saturated colour. He wrote: when the colour achieves richness, the form attains its fullness. Also, his work, along with others, inspired the cubists, expressionists and fauves, who all used colour in an arbitrary fashion, no longer concerned with representing nature and her richness, but turning more to the inner world of the artist to draw inspiration from. So postmodernism was born, and a gap of some hundred years ensued until today, when we are seeing a resurgence in the academic popularity of representational art.\",\n",

I let this stir for about an hour, and then i filtered it off. This was done by just using a couple coffee filters, and the solution that passed through was really nice and clear. When it was done, i washed the filter paper with a lot of distilled water, because as long as it was yellow, it meant that there was gold in it. When i eventually had a completely colorless filter paper, i took away the funnel and i dumped all of this gold solution into a larger container. I also washed the beaker a few times with distilled water to make sure that i transferred everything. Okay, so now the next step was to get the gold out of this solution, and to do this i used potassium metabisulfite. I made a solution of it by adding about 120 grams to 200 mils of distilled water. I thought this was enough to dissolve everything, but it wasn't, so i just kept adding more water until it all disappeared. Normally, i would have just dumped in all of the metabisulfite, but i thought that maybe it could be interesting to add it drop-wise. The moment i did, some brown gold powder started precipitating out, but it wasn't particularly interesting, so i ended up just scrapping that whole idea and dumping in the rest of it. Potassium metabisulfite is a reducing agent, and it reduces the gold in the chloroauric acid back to its uncharged metallic form. It also reacts with leftover nitric acid, though, which is why it was important to use a minimal amount of it when i was dissolving the gold.\",\n",

As you probably all know, the purpose of the verb tense is to indicate the timing or action of a condition's existence. That's the definition of a verb. Surprisingly, many researchers are confused about which tense to use when they describe their research, and i don't blame them. There's specific rules for the different style of formatting guides, so you have to be careful of which to use. But here's a quick guide of which tenses you should generally use, generally speaking. You use the past tense when you're discussing prior research. Dr watson asserted that the mice in group b would be blind. So this is a prior research, not in this study. You use the past tense when discussing the result or observation made during your study, when you're observing the mice in group b. the mice in group b developed tumors in their parietal lobes. Okay, so these are real. You talk about these as you would a real event in life. Right, it's your observations in the present tense. You want to use present tense for general facts such as the earth revolves around the sun, scientific laws, et cetera, the subject of a sentence. When the subject of a sentence is your paper or your study, our study demonstrates our work focuses on. You want to use present tense when discussing a conclusion or interpretation of current findings. So this is again your findings or another's your speculation. Entropy may be involved in this phenomenon. Let's look more closely at some examples. Again, these are past tense and these are general rules. So here's some examples of using prior research.

Protecting children from serious bodily harm or death is a legitimate government interest. Is that an important government interest? Even though we're not applying intermediate scrutiny, just think about it. Is protecting children from harm or death an important government interest? Probably right. In fact, i would say in most cases that's going to be a compelling government interest. Anytime we see the government is protecting children from death or serious bodily harm, this is one of our highest levels of interest the government could have. Anytime the government is really protecting the health safety of large segments of the population, that's probably a compelling government interest, which means it's important, which means it's legitimate. In fact, what we see is most government interests are legitimate, even if it's trivial. Say, the government is trying to increase tax revenue 0.3%, right, whatever, something kind of trivial. Is that a legitimate government interest? Yeah, that's legitimate. Is it important or is it compelling? Probably not. A slight increase in tax revenue- again, it depends on the facts. We'd have to see everything. But just off the cuff, a small increase in tax revenue- probably not a compelling government interest maybe could be important depending on the facts, but probably not an important government interest. It's more trivial, but it's definitely a legitimate government interest. It's hard for a government interest, for the government to have an objective that's actually not legitimate.\",\n",

Das ist aber noch kein konzeptkunstbegriff, der im allgemeinen diese kanonisch beschriebenen werke hinreichend charakterisieren würde, und deswegen besteht eigentlich die philosophische aufgabe nach wie vor, sich die frage zu stellen: was ist eigentlich das vereinigende prinzip, was ist die struktur, die all diesen werken zugrunde liegt?',\n",

And then i'm going to take a script and adapt it so it is more video-friendly. Okay, so if you've watched my other videos, you know i'm a huge fan of having a plan, no matter what that looks like for you. I'm an outliner, i'm not a scripter. So i make a shot list, an outline of the video on my ipad using notability, and then i move to my computer and i use keynote to make a more detailed outline. But a lot of my faculty really prefer using scripts, and i get it because it really does reduce anxiety. It also kind of front loads the work so that by the time you get to the actual recording you're much more calm and relaxed, which is really important, and you can really work that script until it is exactly the way you want it. However, reading from a script usually sounds a lot less natural. It is very difficult to humanize and something usually feels or sounds off almost robotic and it's very, very hard for most people to figure out why it's so different. There's good news, though: if you understand how spoken language differs from written language, that's going to help you when you write your script. So let's take a look at that. We're going to compare typical features of speech versus writing. Speech is much less explicit. There are less clear sentence boundaries, and that gives it a more simple and loose and relaxed structure, and also, speech tends to have more repetitive and more restrictive vocabulary compared to writing. In addition, we have normal disfluency in speech. That means that we make errors in speech and it's considered normal.\",\n",

Make sure the coffee you're using is between five to 14 days off its roast date and measure the yield in grams. To be able to replicate a great shot, you'll often see dose and yield written as a ratio. This specific formula measures ground coffee input to liquid espresso output. A ratio sets the strength of your shot. Ratios for espresso typically range from one to one to one to three. The general rule of using smaller ratios for darker roasts and larger ratios for lighter roasts. Clive's signature recipe is one to 1.5.. that's what we'll be following today: 20 grams of ground coffee in our bottomless portafilter to 30 grams of liquid espresso. Time is what ties everything together. This is the total number of seconds a shot takes, including drop time, from the moment you engage the machine's pump until the last drop of your yield. A one to 1.5 ratio can taste very different at varying amounts of time. For a rich and full-bodied flavor, aim your shot to pull between 25 and 30 seconds. To make this happen, look to your grinder. We'll manipulate the grind size to change how long it takes for the water to flow through the coffee bed. Think of coarse coffee like stones and fine coffee like sand. If you were to pour water over the top, the water would make its way through the rocks much quicker. Changing your grind will allow you to fine-tune the time of your shot. Coffee changes day to day. You'll most likely need to change your grind daily too. As coffee ages, your shots will pull faster, encouraging you to grind finer.\",\n",

Guys, how we maintain the system, how we are able to take classes, how we are able to attend these classes, how the finance is coming, how the technology is coming, how the norms and values are shaped up, how the tension is managed and how all these things are maintained, because the system needs to survive- there are certain things which need to be taken care of- and how the system is surviving. We are here, we are attending this class, for i think it's been two months, right. So how we survived for this two months, how we are doing that in the system. Similarly, if you take any system, how the system is surviving or how the system is maintained, that is one important question that you need to address. That is what he is going to do in the first part of the theory, and the functions fulfilled by a particular system. What are the functions? Which is done, and he will address these two questions in two parts. So this theory will have two parts. The first part obviously addressing this question, and the second part will be addressing this question, and the name of these two parts are like this: moving equilibrium phase.

So the question really is: is your company mainly about continuous improvement or is your company about being hungry enough to kill existing technologies with a new one, even though that, you know it's going to take time? You know this is the difference. This does not refer to human resource management in the first place, i know, but as you're going to see later, an hr strategy that is surrounded by a business environment that is about disruptive development will look different than an hr strategy that is surrounded by a business environment that is about static development. Whatever you look at- variable pay, performance appraisal, talent development- how are you going to look at it. It's really fascinating. It's really fascinating. So let's move further. We still talk about the task, and here is one very essential differentiation. This is about what i name task certainty, and task certainty is about two dimensions: certainty of outcome and certainty of process. So what is this all about? Certainty of outcome means that when you are doing a task, do you know the outcome? Do you know what you will have in the end? Do you see it? You want to build a house from the beginning of what you're doing, do you already see the result? Do you see it? Or an employee is working on a certain kind of procedure. Does the employee know how the result must look like or not? And it's not only about the result, the outcome, it's also about the way to get there. We name this the process. How is it about the certainty of process or process certainty? So when we look at repetitive tasks, we always have a high certainty of outcome and we have a high certainty of process. You do the same things over and over and over again.\",\n",

I like to reuse and recycle materials as much as possible. This is not only economical, it also reduces our impact on landfills and the environment. When creating a cottage garden, it is best to use homely materials like gravel, stone or brick to build out hardscape structures like paths. The trick to break these bigger blocks is to leverage them a bit with a shovel or iron rod, leaving an air gap beneath them. That way, when you hit them with a sledgehammer, it shatters after a few blows into irregular and more manageable shapes. Concrete is generally the last thing you want in a cottage garden. However, you'd be surprised how broken up old concrete paths and patios can suddenly take on a stone-like character. Non-reinforced concrete paths break into irregular shapes that somewhat mimic stone. This material even has a name in the industry. It's called urbanite, since you find it everywhere in urban construction zones. It's usually just trash or fill-in material. Whoever installed this path here did not do a great job laying it out. It was all broken and out of level anyway, so i felt free to experiment. I could always remove it in the future and relay a path with more appropriate materials. I was only spending my time and some elbow grease to reshape the space into a more pleasing configuration. I redrew the path as a curve. This would enlarge the planting space next to the foundation of the house and would create a more harmonious and inviting curve to travel on. By installing the new path a bit below grade, i would also create a channel to steer water away from the house.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"Logistic regression is similar to linear regression, except logistic regression predicts whether something is true or false instead of predicting something continuous like size. These mice are obese and these mice are not. Also, instead of fitting a line to the data, logistic regression fits an s-shaped logistic function. The curve goes from 0 to 1, and that means that the curve tells you the probability that a mouse is obese based on its weight. If we weighed a very heavy mouse, there is a high probability that the new mouse is obese. If we weighed an intermediate mouse, then there is only a 50% chance that the mouse is obese. Lastly, there's only a small probability that a light mouse is obese. Although logistic regression tells the probability that a mouse is obese or not, it's usually used for classification. For example, if the probability a mouse is obese is greater than 50%, then we'll classify it as obese. Otherwise we'll classify it as not obese. Just like with linear regression, we can make simple models. In this case, we can have obesity predicted by weight, or more complicated models. In this case, obesity is predicted by weight and genotype. In this case, obesity is predicted by weight and genotype and age. And lastly, obesity is predicted by weight, genotype, age and astrological sign. In other words, just like linear regression, logistic regression can work with continuous data like weight and age, and discrete data like genotype and astrological sign. We can also test to see if each variable is useful for predicting obesity. However, unlike normal regression, we can't easily compare the complicated model to the simple model, and we'll talk more about why in a bit.\",\n",

The dna carries the genetic information for the cells. Sections of a dna molecule called genes contain the information to make a protein. Dna serves two main functions. Molecules of dna can produce other dna molecules and rna molecules. Rna molecules are directly responsible for synthesis of proteins. And that is all for the four types of organic compounds.

On independent practice, grouping matters for teaching table you want it homogeneous so you can target that lesson, and then in collaborative practice you want it to be mixed skill. So here's how it works: you would take students from group two, which is assigned to collaborative practice right now, and you would assign them working partners from group four so that you can mix the skills in collaborative practice and they can help each other. And the way that you rotate this chart is: you start on the right, where it says group four, you remove that yellow square at the bottom of the chart on the right, then you move each of them over in a clockwise position. So group three would go to collaborative practice, group two would go to independent practice, group one would go to collaborative practice and group four then would be coming to the teaching table and as you progress through the morning you would continue rotating those the bottom of the chart to indicate where each group would go. And our small group times are usually around 15 to 20 minutes and that sounds like a short amount of time but that's really support. What the cognitive research says for targeted explicit instruction for an adult is about 20 minutes. So your students are even younger than that. So this rotation chart is just poster board and velcro but it becomes the essential key that guides students through the activities. They see at the top who they will work with. They see at the bottom the order of their activities. So here's some rotation charts. The one on the left is obviously young, pre-k and kinder. When they can't recognize their name, we use pictures. Chart operates the same. Notice: we do not call it collaborative practice because they can't say that. We call it centers, but it's the same thing.\",\n",

Hi, i'm mike cohn and i'm the author of three best-selling books on agile and scrum. I help teams succeed with agile. First off, sprint goals are great for some teams. Some of the time i just don't think every team needs one every sprint. I have to tell you, though, i'm in the minority on this view, just like i'm in the minority in believing, or at least hoping, that nessie is real. Okay, maybe nessie isn't real, but there are real benefits to having a sprint goal for some teams, just not every team. A sprint goal is a short one or two sentence description of a scrum team's single objective for the sprint. I love that. I spend a lot of time advising organizations to narrow their focus regarding what they'll achieve, whether it be for a year, a quarter or even a single sprint. It's all too common for an organization or team to select a goal the way i load my plate at a buffet: a little of this, a little of that, some of the other, but sometimes a sprint cannot be focused on a single objective. Some teams simply have multiple things that need to get done. For example, consider a digital agency. A team there could be simultaneously building a new website for one client, doing some mid-sized enhancements for a second client and making small bug fixes or edits for five additional clients. How should their sprint goal be written? Should the goal focus on the new website, which will consume the most work during the sprint, or should the goal focus on the small edits, if those are for the company's most important client?\",\n",

For our introduction, we are going to cover these four topics, so our objectives include: explore the origins and goals of the score model, understand the basic structure of score, overview the four central parts of the framework and overview a score improvement program. So first we'll talk about what is score. Score is an acronym for supply chain operations reference model. It was developed to assist businesses to understand, structure and evaluate the performance of their supply chains. It was founded as a supply chain improvement methodology using process analytics, performance metrics and best practices to improve supply chains by identifying performance gaps, guiding organizational change management and providing the analysis needed to drive improvement programs to achieve increased levels of supply chain performance. The score framework was developed in the early 1990s by a consulting firm, particularly rabin todd and mcgrath and amr research, with the assistance of individuals from corporations such as bayer, compaq, procter & gamble, lockheed martin and others to develop a methodology to improve supply chain performance. In 1996, prtm and amr founded a user-based organization, the supply chain council. Starting with the original 69 corporations driving its inception, scc managed score for many hundreds of member companies and by 2012,, the initial score framework had progressed through 11 revisions. In 2014,, scc merged with apex. The score method was integrated into apex operations management body of knowledge framework and apex certifications to provide optimized supply chain management knowledge, best practices and performance. This brief history is important to show that score is a tool created by and for practitioners to improve their supply chains. Score uses best practices arising from real-world examples and research and is not an academic exercise. Score is a living document.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"The best way that i can describe business ethics is: it simply represents the what we would call principles and standards that determine acceptable conduct in business. And these principles and standards are really important because in a business setting, we need to be able to understand what are the essential rules of the game, so to speak, and what is going to be acceptable versus unacceptable behavior. Now, when we think about business ethics, a lot of times we think about our own individual ethics. Right, we think about our own individual beliefs about what is right and what is wrong in this. While there is some degree of consistency between person to person- right, we have established laws around things that we view as a society. That is something that is particularly unethical. There can be varying degrees of what is considered to be okay from person to person. Now the challenge is, within a business context, is you have a significant motivation for making sure that your employees act in an ethical manner? Because there are huge downsides associated with engaging in unethical behavior, and we've seen huge examples of this, for example, wells fargo opening fake accounts or incentivizing folks to open fake accounts for a variety of different reasons but as a way to kind of attain certain monetary type bonuses. So when we're thinking about what impacts business ethics, we usually think about three things, three specific factors that are going to have an influence on business ethics. Now, what i do want to emphasize is, individually, each one of these isn't going to entirely sway a particular decision and affect the extent to which people engage in good, ethical behavior, but these are the three factors that are going to have an impact on the decisions that we make within an organization.\",\n",

So phenytoin, also known as dilantin, is an anti-seizure medication. If you didn't know this, you can focus on the data in the question and know that a diagnosis of seizure disorder is provided there for you, and so, if there's a diagnosis noted in any pharmacology question. This can help you to determine if you didn't know, or what it's being used for. A very important adverse effect specific to phenytoin that you're likely to be asked about is that it causes gingival hyperplasia. Gingival hyperplasia causes bleeding, tenderness or swelling of the gums, and so be sure to remember this about this medication. Fatigue and drowsiness are kind of comparable or alike to the symptoms of a seizure disorder, and so you can eliminate these as adverse effects. Dizziness may occur, but in this case is not an adverse effect. So be sure to know what the question is specifically asking about, and in this question you can see it's asking about an adverse effect. All right, so next linda's going to go over a question about amoxicillin. Thank you, angela. Okay, on this slide we have another question about an adverse effect, and the medication is amoxicillin. So a client diagnosed with a genital urinary tract infection is receiving amoxicillin 500 milligrams every eight hours. Which sign or symptom would indicate to the nurse that the client is experiencing an adverse effect related to the medication? One nausea, two headache, three nausea: one nausea, two headache, three hypertension and four watery diarrhea.\",\n",

Rightio, let's take a little bit of a break from botany. Let's mix it up, let's get crafty. See that weeping willow tree right there. We're going to take a branch of that weeping willow tree and we're going to miraculously fashion it into a signal whistle. You what, son? Indeed a search and rescue whistle. And we're not talking about a tenuous little whistle whom siren is that of a teapot boiling over. No, no, we're talking about a signal whistle that can achieve sound levels of upwards to 100 decibels, which is just as loud as commercially sold search and rescue whistles. Just imagine cross woodland communication with your brethren, catcalling your girlfriend, impressing your girlfriend with your handy woodcrafts, signalling for rescue, deafening your friends by blowing it right in their ear. The possibilities are endless, and all you need is a stick of willow and a knife. So let's proceed. To begin, i will annotate the areas of interest, the far end of this stick. Nothing goes on here. Everything occurs up this end. This is the working end and this is the cut-off point. This is what will eventually become the mouthpiece of the whistle, once all is said and done. So the first order of business is to create the blowhole of the whistle in the form of a small v-shaped notch about an inch or so below the cut-off point. So let's do that now. That's done, we just need to pull off the bark. So we'll need to separate the whistle's bark from the rest of the stick.\",\n",

In the recorded force elongation diagram the force f1 is the force at which the test piece can sustain elastically. The force fel at the upper yield point can clearly be seen. This is the highest force the test piece can sustain elastically. Fel is defined as the force at the lower yield point, fmax as the maximum force. Using these forces the strength properties of materials can be calculated. The lower yield strength, rel, is defined in a similar way. The maximum force divided by the original cross-sectional area is called tensile strength, rm. In the last step the tester swings the extensometer back into its resting position and removes the broken test piece on the work table. He puts the fragments back together again. With the help of the distance marks the percentage elongation after fracture can be determined. This is the permanent strain after fracture and amounts to about 30% in this example. Please note that the percentage elongation after fracture depends on the length to diameter ratio. By measuring the smallest diameter at the point of fracture, the percentage reduction of area can be calculated. It describes the reduction of cross-sectional area at the point of fracture in relation to the original cross-sectional area. In the second tensile test a material without yield point phenomenon is to be tested. In this case it is a precipitation-strengthened aluminium alloy. The test piece has exactly the same shape and dimensions as the specimen in the first test. It is cylindrical, with an original diameter of 10 mm and an original gauge length of 100 mm. After fitting the test piece into the testing machine and panning the extensometer into its working position, the test can start.',\n",

In summary, our first stage strategy is about defining business justification and the outcomes. Once this stage is completed, we move to the planning phase. In the planning phase, there are again few steps that we need to follow. The first step is digital estate. This is so-called inventory of assets.

This definition emphasizes that mere belief is not enough to constitute knowledge. Rather, one must have good reasons for believing something to be true. So when one says i believe this to be the case, it should not be assumed to have the same meaning as if one had said i know this to be the case, and in everyday language a difference between these two statements is indeed usually recognized. Rather, in order to know or have knowledge of something in the sense of justified true belief, there must be solid grounds for holding the belief, and the individual must be aware of such grounds. Guesses, conjectures and mere opinions that may or may not lead an individual to a correct belief of a fact are typically not classified as knowledge, because such an individual would not be aware of the reasons for the proposition being true. Now that we have introduced epistemology and looked at what it means to have knowledge. We will conclude the lecture by addressing the interesting question of why humans need a theory of knowledge in the first place. As aristotle seems to have alluded to in the quote at the beginning of this lecture, humans seem to be inquisitive by nature. In a related manner, nicholas rescher suggests that, but while this may explain why we as humans need knowledge, it does not quite address why we need a theory of knowledge. If one accepts what is presented to their senses or determined through the rational workings of their mind as true and is not skeptical as to its validity, then the need for epistemology is limited, for in such a case one does not question what knowledge is or how humans can obtain it.',\n",

And then from the next part in the scrum master definition, scrum master serves the organization in several ways, including leading, training and coaching the organization in its scrum adoption. Notice the focus on the word leading here. Right, you are a leader that drives the scrum adoption in the organization, planning and advising scrum implementations within the organization. Once again, if it seemed like something an agile coach in your organization would usually do, now it is clear here that it is the scrum master's role to actually do that. There is no separation between someone who works with the organization and someone who works with the team. It's the scrum master.

Hair is composed of a strong structural protein called keratin. The hair grows within a hollow tube called the follicle. Here's a little hair trivia for you. Hair can be shaved, cut, styled and groomed. But why doesn't it hurt when you cut your hair? The answer is: it doesn't hurt when the hair is cut because there are no nerves. But then why does it hurt when you pluck your eyebrow or pull a hair out of the scalp. That's because at the base of the hair follicle are sensory nerve fibers that wrap around each hair bulb. Alright, the third major part of the integumentary system is the nail. The nail's main function is to serve the fingers and toes as protective plates and enhance the sensation of the fingertip or the toe tip. Like the hair, the nail is also composed of keratin. Primarily, the nail is made up of dead epithelial cells packed tightly together to form a translucent, thick, dense surface of keratin. The nail is formed in the nail bed. If you slam your finger in the door, you may lose a nail, but it will regrow. If you damage the nail bed, however, that nail will never come back. Before we conclude part one of the integumentary system, let's review. There are three main parts to this body system: the skin, the hair and the nails. And the skin has three main layers: the epidermis, which is the outermost layer. The dermis, which is just below the epidermis and contains major structures and functions for the skin within a framework of elastic connective tissue.\",\n",

It means it has to tax the people in the economy because obviously the government requires funding to be able to supply these public goods. So, in terms of correcting market failure, the government has to supply public goods. Externalities are obviously a really big issue in terms of market failure and stuff like that, with positive and negative externalities, meaning that the market mechanism output is either far higher or far lower than the socially efficient output. We have lots of different ways of trying to correct this. One of these is regulation. Regulation is rules to the firms to make sure that they try to keep their negative externalities to a low. So, for example, there might be regulation saying you can only pollute up to a certain amount. You can only use trees which were dying anyway. I don't know what sort of regulation you might have, but stuff like that. Try to reduce negative externalities. Pollution permits are the big things nowadays. These are permits which allow firms to pollute up to a limit, and these permits can be traded between firms, countries, whatever. So say, i had a permit which allowed me to emit 100 of pollution. I don't know what measurement you'd use, and i only used 50, i could sell the other 50 to another company which is polluting more. So it's really beneficial for me and other firms to keep our pollution to a low, whereas firms that have higher pollution have higher costs and may end up getting kicked out of the market.\",\n",

Qualitative might be: well, what does the customer think about the item that we just sent them? Do they like it? Those type things, those tend to be more qualitative rather than quantitative. Quantitative deals with numbers, information which can be measured, such as length, height, so on, sound levels, cost members, ages.

Qualitative deal with descriptions and information that can be observed but is difficult to measure, and maybe in discovering attitudes or opinions, you would use qualitative.

The phrase less is more, which is something that we hear often in the design world, was first applied by ludwig mies van der rohe, who was one of the pioneers of the minimalist movement. If we take a look at some of the buildings he designed, a lot of the architecture nowadays is, in a way, trying to mimic his style. Basically, most of those typical looking houses that we see on pinterest or in instagram are mimics of what he way back in the 1950s. If you want to dig deeper into his philosophy, i highly recommend you take a look at more of his work right after you finish this video. So the first type of minimalism is aesthetic minimalism, which might be the most popular form of minimalism that is today. I think we can all agree that clutter isn't pretty. Therefore, this type of minimalism strives a simple and clean aesthetic. Clean lines, white walls and a few belongings have become such an interior design trend in the last few years and it's hard to escape from the popularity of it with all the exposure that it gets on social media. Decorating, tidying and general living are a lot more complicated when you have a wide range of ornaments or stuff in general in our living areas and instead minimalist seems to always have one of these type of pictures in the wall and usually a color scheme of white, beige and gray. The second type of minimalism is eco-minimalism. Eco-minimalism in design seeks to lower the amount of items so in the future there is less waste produced by that living area.\",\n",

It didn't do hook things, it was just somebody had been reading react code and was like: oh, everything starts with the word use, so i guess my function should start with the word use. And we got on the topic of: well, what really makes a hook a hook? How do you know that your hooks are hooks, that they're doing hook things? It seems like something that someone new to react could easily get confused around. So how would all of you try and explain something like this to someone who's less well-versed in react? Kent, let's raise his hand. I've got a very simple definition for what a hook is. A hook is a function that uses other hooks. That's it. Somewhere in that call stack it needs to call one of the actual hooks built into react. It might be through some other custom hook, but if it doesn't ultimately result in at least one hook from react being called, it's not actually a hook.\",\n",

Alright, so here's pythagoras, here is the general equation for a circle and here is the unit circle. Now we're in a position to relate that during our arithmetic break, notice that we generated through that little break a bunch of equations exactly of this form. These are exactly of this form and if these have this form, then this must be a legitimate x and this must be a legitimate y on this circle. And therefore, this is an x, this is an x, this is an x, this is a y, this is a y and this is a y, because they all satisfy the unit circle relationship. And we figured out what these points were simply by doing some arithmetic during our little 1 plus 1 equals 2 break. So that is a way to generate points on the circle. So let's see what that looks like. Okay, so i'm just repeating over here what we had. These are some of our points that we generated in our arithmetic break. They have to lie on the unit circle because they follow the form: x squared plus y squared equals 1.. we just need to figure out how to plot them. Okay, so let's take this point right here, which is halfway between 0 and pi over 2, or 0 and 90. And because it's halfway, one of the things that we automatically know is the x and the y value must have the same value. And notice that this point, therefore, at pi over 4,, which is half of pi over 2, must be this value, because it's the only one that's halfway. Pi over 4 is halfway.\",\n",

Yeah, the bad guys are definitely out there and they're the bad guys and gals. They're figuring out different attack vectors. They have. You know they're first trying to figure out if you are running your containers, where you're running it, and then, once they identify that you have kubernetes, that gives them a whole other list of things to check off and test, for you know if any of your containers and your clusters are privileged and you know if they can somehow gain root level access. You know, and escape the docker, you know runtime and then get into a node and compromise a node, because then, once they compromise one node, they can do things like you know, in a large cluster, start dropping bitcoin mining agents in there and, you know, utilize all your resources to fatten their purses. And as you mentioned that- sorry, i had to go back and look. So the first publicly acknowledged kubernetes incident that i'm aware of was in 2018.. and it was tesla. There was a ton of coverage of it before gks, before gke, before all of the managed kubernetes platforms. They had split up a couple of kubernetes platforms in aws, accidentally exposed unauthenticated api endpoints to the internet and somebody came along and dropped a bunch of cryptocurrency miners on them- yeah, which i think is sort of the base. You know, using somebody else's cpu to mint money for you is a very quick way to monetize a compromise like that. You know, i think we are going to see attackers get better at this.\",\n",

But if you don't measure the system, if you gain no information about the quantum system, then the evolution of the system is described always by a unitary matrix: u. This turns out to be really crucial, this distinction between evolution and information gain and closeness. All right. So the evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary matrix, and we describe evolutions in one of two equivalent ways. We could do either in the so-called schrodinger picture, where your preparation gets updated to a new preparation. And what's the new preparation after the system has evolved? Well, the new preparation is u rho u dagger. So after the evolution takes place, you can describe the system as being really equivalent to the system whereby we've just prepared it, in a different quantum state, different density matrix. What density matrix? Well, the one where you've taken the old one and you've multiplied it by u rho u dagger. Or in the heisenberg picture, whereby we update our detector operator. So the detection that we're going to do gets mapped to a new one: f, prime, u, dagger, u f, u. So you either implement your evolution in the schrodinger picture, where you model the system as being prepared in the new state rho prime, or you model it in the heisenberg picture, where you say the preparation is the preparation, that doesn't change, but the device that we detected the system with is now effectively replaced with another one. As we'll see, these two ways of implementing evolution lead to the same outcome, the same probability. So we can never tell operationally.\",\n",

I mean it kind of has some green tea qualities if you look at it that way. But there's, and then this is really strange how green coffee has this color, whereas you know you actually get some yellowing and browning. But the green coffee is darker. And also, oh my, there's an interesting layer in the cup down there between the green. It looks like maybe just the chaff has settled the silver skin. That tastes like play-doh or crayon or something. That's really not a coffee flavor at all. So that was pretty interesting to look at these from that perspective. The color difference alone is great, but i think this is really interesting. The smell, the smells from these lighter ones here. Grinding the coffee, whatever it is, the raw coffee, really strong bittering, smells really interesting. So kind of a fun, not as stupid of a just a haphazard lesson as i thought. I actually got something out of this in terms of identifying, you know, especially triganelline, which is the compound that, as you roast, is actually diminished in darker roasts, and triganelline is an extremely bitter compound, so but i'm going to go back and taste these some more.

So that's another way to run your pipeline. The other way is a schedule type pipeline.

But i can tell you that that kind of style wouldn't have the emotional impact that this style has, which is more abstract. That's why artists like bob peake or bernie fuchs turned to a more abstract style later in their life. Their style begins to change because they begin to realize that a more abstract style like this, in which the principles of design are applied, is able to express mood in a much more powerful way than a more strictly realistic, more tight look. Now, peake didn't make this subject look realistic because he understood that reality in art is independent of literal visual scenes and objects. Art has its own truth and reason for being, and this is peake's truth of the subject that he is showing us. He has created a kind of new reality that is much more visually interesting and exciting to look at than real reality and thereby lets us see the subject in a new way, in a fresh way, in a way that we haven't seen before and that gives us an emotional experience. One of the great illustrations is all about mostly emotion. Sure, there's story involved, but it's the emotional form that should become more important, and emotional form isn't just about abstraction. It is adding all those other additional things of picture making, like i've been pointing out, like the principles of design and lighting, value patterns, animation and so on- all of the components of picture making, in addition to the abstraction, results in what is called emotional form, and there can be different degrees of abstraction, like ben stahl shows in his chart here that i showed you earlier in the video. You have to decide how abstract you want to make your subject.\",\n",

Itunes soundcheck technology, the cross-genre itunes playlist, exhibits big loudness jumps, especially between older and newer material. The solution for itunes, as for broadcast, is loudness normalization. Soundcheck is itunes' loudness normalization technology. It can be enabled in the itunes preference settings. From there on it will work transparently and seamlessly. Upon playback, the gain of each file is adjusted to eliminate sudden increases or decreases in track-to-track sound level as you listen. The music files themselves are not altered in any way by this process, which is reversible. With soundcheck activated, modern hip-hop can play next to classic rock and dynamic material can sit effectively next to compressed material in any tailor-made playlist, soundcheck on by default. I believe soundcheck will be turned on by default in future versions of itunes and apple ios devices, though apple has made no announcements about this. As of the upload date of this video, soundcheck on by default will be a game-changer. Although producers have no control over the playback loudness of their product, they can create a new product with much more control over its clarity, macrodynamics, microdynamics and spatial characteristics. The word competition takes on a whole new meaning with loudness normalization. Life in the music world just gets better. When producers listen to their song on itunes with soundcheck turned on, they discover that over-processed material sounds worse. Neither your music playback platforms are capable of loudness normalization. New cars come equipped with aux connections, and the aux and itunes are rapidly replacing the compact disc player in the car and at home. Other playback systems and some digital music services, such as spotify, are also using loudness normalization technology.\",\n",

Das sind 4-5 gruppen, jede woche ein haus. Es boomt auch in der corona-zeit. Wir merken nichts davon. Tatsächlich ist die nachfrage nach fertighäusern in den monaten der pandemie sogar gestiegen. Mehr als 11.000 bekamen im 1. Halbjahr eine baugenehmigung- ein rekord. Diese bauherren wirken entspannt noch, man muss ja noch nichts machen. Jetzt ist es noch lustig, man passt auf und andere arbeiten. Später kommt man selber mit dazu und muss gucken, dass man fertig wird.',\n",

Moon daisies are edible in their entirety, and not only edible, but incredibly high in vitamin c and provitamin a in the form of beta keratin, which is useful in the maintenance of immune system function, particularly pertaining to the protective barriers of the skin and the production of lymphocytes, otherwise known as white blood cells in. So the consumption of moon daisies will serve to fight infection from within by boosting immune system function. Not only that, but moon daisies boast an antispasmodic property. What does that mean? Well, it just means it will relieve muscular spasms and muscular cramps. Why would you need an antispasmodic? Well, if you are an otherwise healthy individual, male, then you would not typically need one. But the females, during their menses, during their monthly discharge of blood and cellular debris from the uterus, are probably all too familiar with the agonizing stomach cramps that are associated with that. But moon daisies will work to relieve your menstrual aches and pains, leaving you free to take on the day and resume shopping and buying shoes or whatever the fuck it is the girls do, i don't know. But here's a secret: moon daisies, as an ornamental flower, are a fan favourite amongst the females for their heavenly and harmonious aesthetic appearance. This is a fact based on very little evidence, but search your feelings. You know it to be true that if you were to present onto your fair maiden a bouquet of freshly picked moon daisies, a brilliant cluster of fluorescent, snow-white inflorescence, then her knickers will drop like a sack of bricks.

We probably would use a t-test to determine this difference, again relying on statistics. If you were to recall your conversations in a given day, you probably realize now that you have been using the language of statistics on a daily basis. At the same time, the news media use statistics all the time to demonstrate how trends are changing. 2016 was the year american presidential elections were held. Big surprises there between what the polls forecasted and what the outcome was. But again you see these numbers portrayed in the newspapers. At the same time, you have other publications that show you how housing prices or other development-related statistics vary over countries. In a nutshell, the information we consume and the conversations we have every day involve a lot of statistics, so it pays one to learn some statistics. The first step in analytics or statistics is to have a good look at your data and, before you begin, try to understand what kind of variable you're working with and based on the type of variable, you will decide what kind of analytics could be performed with it. Let's have a look at various different types of data that we encounter and is commonly used in our daily lives. The most common one would be a cross-sectional data, which is basically looking at a measurement taken at one point in time. Census in a given year is a cross-section of the society as students evaluate, course, an instructor. That's a cross-section at any given point. Compared to the cross-sectional data, we can have panel or cross-sectional panel data, which is essentially asking the same group of individuals, the same questions repeatedly over time.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"Later in this lesson you'll see an implementation that is much more appropriate for embedded systems, but before that i'd like to discuss the proper use of assertions. To use assertions properly and effectively, you must clearly distinguish between programming errors and exceptional conditions. Errors, known otherwise as bugs, are persistent defects due to design or implementation mistakes, for example dividing by zero, overrunning an array index, dereferencing a null pointer or using a peripheral before initializing it. When your software has a bug, typically you cannot reasonably quote-unquote handle the situation. Instead you should focus on detecting, reporting and ultimately fixing the bug. Also, you typically cannot continue execution. Instead, you must carefully devise a damage control strategy. This is where the assertions come in. In contrast to errors, exceptional conditions are specific circumstances that can legitimately arise during the system's lifetime, but are relatively rare and lie off the main execution path of your software. Examples include incorrect user input, transmission, errors on inherently unreliable connections such as wireless, abnormal or degraded modes of operation, etc. In those cases, you should not use assertions. Rather, you must carefully design and implement strategies that handle such exceptional conditions using regular code. Attempting to quote-unquote handle an error as an exceptional condition is just as bad as the other way around. This programming style is known as defensive programming. It aims to make the software more robust to errors by accepting a wider range of inputs or allowing an order of operations inconsistent with the program's state. For example, a defensively programmed int-div function would not assert, but instead it would quote-unquote handle the 0 divisor by returning some bogus value, such as 0xffff.\",\n",

Secondly, the different transporters responsible for active secretion, like pgp and the different types of oats and octs can be a cause of drug-drug interaction. These transporters can be induced, inhibited, blocked or saturated. For example, cimetidine, an h2 receptor blocker used for ulcer treatment, inhibits the organic cation transporter, reducing tubular secretion of metformin, which could cause an increase of plasma levels of up to 40%. Fortunately, there are only few clinically relevant interactions, but i'm sure more will surface in time. By the way, fun fact though, used for the calculation of glomerular filtration rate, creatinine itself undergoes tubular secretion for about 10-20%, and this amount can increase up to 50% in people with renal failure. This is why you see an increase in serum creatinine levels when you prescribe trimethoprim, without actually causing a decrease in gfr. Lastly, remember in the absorption video when we talked about the influence of ph on the ionization of weak acids and bases. Well, that applies here too. A trick used in toxicology is to alkalinize the urine with sodium bicarbonate. This is, for instance, used for the treatment of an aspirin overdose. Aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid. Sodium bicarbonate ionizes the drug and makes it more water-soluble, keeping it in urine and out of our body. The same goes for phenobarbital. And that sums up what i wanted to share on excretion and renal clearance. And that brings us to the end of the introductory series on pharmacokinetics.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"Okay, so here are five tips on how to draw perspective. First one is the most basic and simple one. Tip number one: the horizon line. Always start a sketch with the horizon line. What is the horizon line? It's a horizontal line running through a view that marks your eye height. That means that everything that is on the horizon line is as tall as you. Everything that's below the horizon line is shorter than you and everything that's above the horizon line is taller than you. Keep that in mind. Tip number two: the heads of all people in an eye height perspective are on the horizon line. No matter how far away the people are standing from you, the heads will always lie on the horizon and the body will extend underneath it. Why? Because the horizon represents the eye height and most grown-ups are roughly as tall as you. To create a feeling of space, we can draw figures of different sizes with their heads on the horizon. If the figure is smaller it doesn't mean it's shorter, but it's standing further away from us. Of course, there are exceptions: children are below the horizon line and most basketball players would reach above the horizon line. Tip number three: use people to determine proportions. In a sketch let's draw a person standing somewhere in space with his or her head on the horizon, like we just learned. Let's call the person charlie. Charlie is going to be our basic size unit. Everything and everyone that is standing next to our charlie is reaching downwards from the horizon the same length charlie is. That means it's standing the same distance away from us. Because of that, we can use charlie to determine the height of all the objects in that distance. So let's say we want to draw a five meters high lamp post.\",\n",

I can go ahead and grab the container id and i can say docker logs with the container id and i can get the same logs. We can see the container runtime collects all the standard out logs for each container. Now, remember, a container is just a process. So if i ran redis on top of linux without a container, i would see exactly the same thing. This is because, if we look at the documentation, by default docker logs shows the commands output just as it would have appeared if the command ran interactively in the terminal. So whether it's running in a container or not, it's going to behave the same. Docker picks up all the logs from standard out and standard error. So if docker is by default writing all the container logs to standard out, how do we access those? So if we take a look at the docker host and we ran docker system info, if we scroll down we can see that docker root directory is set to var lib docker. This is the directory that docker stores all its data, including logs. So if i say docker ps and i grab the id of the redis container and then let's try to access that docker directory by running a container and mounting var lib docker into the container.

So let's go through the laundry list of all quantum gates. I'm going to start drawing pictures without defining this notation, but you'll get used to the pictures. So here's evolution according to x. pauli x, it's called. Got to get used to this notation. Pauli x is the matrix. U equals 0011, like that. Is it unitary? Well, that's an exercise for you, but i hope you can do that sort of while i'm writing. Here's another evolution in quantum circuits. It's called pauli y.

The silver and other trace metals are also being converted to nitrate salts and getting dissolved into solution. The silver nitrate is colorless, though, and there isn't enough of the other metals to really affect the color. When the reaction died down, i added another load of dilute nitric acid, and it started bubbling like crazy again. I waited for this to also settle down, and when it was done, i dumped everything into a larger beaker. I then kept adding more of the dilute acid, and i continued the same cycle. As i mentioned before, i'm using dilute acid here instead of the concentrated stuff, and there were two major reasons for this. The first one is that it stops the reaction from getting out of control, and the second one is that i needed the extra water to dissolve all of the metal salts that i was making here. A major effect of this, though, is that, compared to the concentrated stuff, the reaction is slowed down quite a bit, which makes it take a lot longer. So to speed things up, this reaction needs to be heated, usually close to the boiling point. I didn't use a thermometer, though, and i thought i was close enough, but i don't think i was, and because of this it would initially react quite a bit when i added more acid, but then it would kind of just stop. However, just by looking at the stuff at the bottom, i could tell there was still a lot of copper left. At the time. I thought that maybe the acid was just depleted, so i dumped off the liquid and i added new, fresh stuff. The same thing happened again, though, so i started getting suspicious, but still i decided to dump everything off and to add more fresh acid again.\",\n",

So what does that mean? Well, it's kind of a difficult thing to explain and it's because when you're talking about voltage and amperage, what you're talking about is electrons moving through wires and across materials and through distributions, and it is difficult for people to think like that. But i think there's a fairly good analogy. Say, you've got a hose- yes, this is a hose. Okay, when you're dealing with voltage, that's the pressure difference. Let me show you what i mean. So here's your hose, i'm gonna give it a place for water to flow out, and let's give it some water, and of course it's gonna spill out of it. And there we go, okay. So let's look at this point: in the hose, p1, and out here, p2. So these are the two pressures. Now there's a lot of water in the hose and there's a confining space. So the pressure in here is pretty great, greater than pressure to where there's no confining space for the water to be jammed against one another. So that's sort of like voltage. So out here you've got your high voltage, so your five volts plus, and out here you've got your ground, that's zero volts. Okay, then you've got amps, which is volume of water. So we look here a one, amount one, and out here a two. The amount of water is the same, so the current is the same.\",\n",

Our null hypothesis will be mean beauty scores for instructors don't differ with age and the alternative hypothesis will be: at least one of the means is different. First, this variable does not exist in our data. We will need to group or bin the continuous age data using the dot lock function in pandas, then use the f underscore one way function in the scipy stats library to perform the anova test. We will then print out the f statistics and the p-value. What we can see is that the p-value is 4.32 times 10 raised to the power of negative 8, and that is less than 0.05.. we will reject the null hypothesis as there is significant evidence that at least one of the means differ. If i do the same test for the teaching evaluation scores that we observed for the three groups and we run anova on these three mean values. We find out that the p-value is 0.295, which is greater than 0.05.. we will fail to reject the null and infer equal means, that is, that the three means are not statistically different. Here we have the analysis of variance performed on two samples. One is the beauty score. We notice that the difference in means for beauty scores between the three groups is based on the significance value. This leads us to conclude that at least one mean is different and we reject the null hypothesis that states equal means. And here, because the p-value for teaching evaluation scores between the three groups is greater than 0.05,, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. We believe that these three means are statistically equal. Now, moving ahead from comparing the average values between two or more groups, we are looking at two variables.\",\n",

That's right. Life insurance companies, right. Life insurance companies are least likely to make those small loans. They'll generally make large loans, let's say, $3 million and up. Another thing that's pretty important about life insurance companies for our test is at the bottom of the page in bold, you'll see the term participation loan. So a participation loan is a loan wherein the lender typically a life insurance company. In this context, a lender will make you the loan, but they'll also take a small minority share an ownership in the project. So the lender might say, look, we'll make you the loan, but we also want a small equity share in the project. Now you have to be careful, though, as an investor, because a lot of the times, when life insurance companies make these participation loans, they'll have a say in management also. So if you have a gardener friend of yours or a landscaper that you're pretty close with and that lender says that hey, look, this landscaper's charging too much money, it's possible that that lender might be able to dictate who you actually can use to landscape the project, because they also have an equity interest in the property. So two institutional lenders, one commercial banks- right, we know these guys make a variety of loans and they're active in construction lending. We know that.

Before going to the lecture, create a topic skeleton from the lecture slides or handout to familiarise yourself with the topic. Then, when in the lecture, condense what is said into bullet points, using sub-bullet points to give ideas a hierarchical structure that is easier to remember. Focus on extracting key information said by the lecturer rather than writing every single word, and try to make keywords bold as you go along. Finally, grapple with tricky topics after the lecture, explaining things to yourself and drawing diagrams. And remember my top tips.

Here on the left we have our tool panel where we can choose what we want to do. Let's start off with a rectangular sketch here. Let's do it on the bottom here. This gives us our sketch and then we can also- we could add even more detail to it. But let's just take this sketch and extrude it, give it some height. Let's say: right about here, and then we maybe want to add some holes into it, just like before. We can just create another sketch here with all the holes that we want, and then we can use this tool again, and maybe this is actually not what i wanted to do, but we can then just simply, like that, create a hole into our part here. And if you want more than that, you can. Of course there are more features available. You can also use this other sidebar here where you can do things like change the color of it. Let's say, here we take the gray paint bucket and then we can paint it gray. There's also a whole components warehouse. Well, let's say we want to add some bolts to this. We just search for bolt here and then it gives us a whole list of different things. There are actually 2400 pages just for bolts, so you might want to specify it a bit more. But let's say we want this one, we just download it real quick and add it in here, and we already have the bolts inside of the model now. Now, it's, of course, way too big, but we can easily fix that by scaling it up.\",\n",

He want or she wants mutuality of mutuality of orgasm with the loved one partner right, from opposite gender, right, with whom one is willing and able to share trust. The true love is not only sex and orgasms. There should be some degree of trust in between. Right, so there should be also trust. And with whom? Any other person with whom one is able to regulate the cycles of work, cycles of procreation and cycles of recreation. True love does not mean just sex. Again, i'm repeating the component which eric rickson said, that genital utopia. He says it's ideal, it is not achievable, but this is what almost every girl think, that if it can happen in her life, and maybe some boys also.\",\n",

They're called quantum gates. All of these things here are examples of quantum gates. Examples one and two are examples of single qubit gates. Like doing nothing is like just doing nothing on qubit j. So these are called single qubit gates. They're allowed evolutions of closed quantum systems. Doing c, not on neighbouring qubits, is a two qubit gate, right? We've got qubit j and j plus one. Something happens to them. Swap is a two qubit gate. Unitaries, one to four.

So we've got our little masked hippo glue bottle right here inside of picmonic- just a little cute little nugget right there. And what are those signs and symptoms? Well, beta blockers block beta receptors and when they block beta receptors they prevent the release of epinephrine. And that prevention of epinephrine, when you get a low blood sugar, your body throws out a bunch of epinephrine and when it throws out that epinephrine it causes those systemic symptoms. What are they? Well, that's going to have a little bit of tachycardia, which is beta blocker blocks. You're going to have a little bit of sweating, a little bit of diaphoresis and you're not going to get those symptoms without that epinephrine because of the beta blocker. So it masks those signs of hypoglycemia. You need to remember- also important, not to give a beta blocker in a patient with a heart block- we've got our heart with blocks here wrapped in caution tape- or for asthma, because it can cause bronchoconstriction.

Cardiac muscle allows the contractions of the heart muscle. Skeletal muscle attaches to bones, allowing for conscious movement. Nerve cells or neurons come together, forming the major cell type of nervous tissue. Nervous tissue allows for integration and communication. Different tissue types come together to form organs. This brings us to the organ level of our anatomical organization. Organs provide specific functions in the body. For example, the brain is the control center of the body. It receives sensory input, integrates information and sends motor commands. The heart is an organ that functions to pump the blood through the blood vessels. The kidneys are organs that filter the blood and make urine. The lungs function to inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. The stomach is an important organ for digestion. Organs work together in the body in a cooperative fashion as organ systems. This brings us to the organ systems level of our anatomical organization. The human body has 12 organ systems, each of which contains several specific organs working together to perform specific functions in the body. These include the digestive system, the integumentary system, the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the skeletal system, the muscular system, the immune system, the lymphatic system, the endocrine system, the reproductive system and the urinary system. The digestive system functions to absorb nutrients from the foods we eat and to eliminate indigestible waste. Ingested food must be broken down and processed to make nutrients available for the tissues. The portion that is not digested is eliminated from the body in the form of feces. The integumentary system includes the skin, hair, nails and exocrine glands. The integumentary system forms the external body covering and protects deeper tissues from injury.',\n",

Okay, postulate one: each type of quantum system is assigned a hilbert space h. okay, i'll immediately do an example to give you an example. So we're assigning a hilbert space to each type of quantum system. Let me give you an example of a type of quantum system. We're doing quantum computation here today. The most fundamental atomic type of quantum system in quantum computation is the quantum bit or qubit, and that is assigned the hilbert space, c2, the space of all column vectors, with two complex entries. This hilbert space you shouldn't think of is directly leading to any predictions in quantum mechanics. Rather, it's the kind of mathematical space upon which the structure of quantum mechanics is built. So it's the background set in which quantum mechanics takes place. So the qubit is one type of quantum system that you might think of as the qubit. So the qubit is one type of quantum system that you might encounter in quantum computation. You might encounter the qubit. As the name suggests, the qubit is a d-level quantum system and it's assigned the hilbert space, or vector space within a product, c to the d. so this is just the space of all column vectors with d entries.

So this shows that from the rgb imagery, we can detect these changes. These changes also line up with the parcel data that has appeared over the last five years, and so, using these layers together, we're able to come up with really cool insights for the future. So we use this to validate our approach, and one of the cool things that we're kind of looking at now is trying to be able to track construction without having to send people out on a site, which seems to be one of the stories that people are really interested in looking at. So i want to talk briefly about how we're actually detecting these changes. So we're using a combination of four different popular packages within the python ecosystem, and really we use a lot of open source tools and contribute a lot to open source. This visualization at the top is showing each one of these bars is a single gpu in the cloud, and we're using four gpus in the cloud in parallel to be able to run the change detection- over 80 gigabytes of satellite imagery- in just under a couple of minutes. So for this change detection specifically, we trained a deep learning model in pytorch, and pytorch is a machine learning framework for fast research, prototyping and production deployment. We scaled up our model using dask and cuda. So dask is a way to horizontally scale your code. So imagine you write some code and you've got it working on your laptop, but you want to be able to run it on hundreds of machines in the cloud or even hundreds of machines on a server locally, if you have that. So dask is really good at horizontal scaling. Cuda is used to be able to run code directly on a gpu.\",\n",

Okay, if you've paid everybody and you're good to go and you didn't reduce any salaries and you didn't reduce any ftes and you hand in the application, it's done and over with in determining what happens on the go forward. Okay, if ftes and the salary reduction comes into play, okay, your time period ended of tracking that. So let me say it the opposite: you're handing in a loan forgiveness app and you got a haircut.

Another trouble with the unconscious mind: unconscious mind cannot differentiate between fantasy and reality. Unconscious mind cannot differentiate between fantasy and reality. Is that right?

This means that i'll skim-read through the notes or the lecture slides before the lecture and create an outline of the topic i'm going to be making notes about. I number each of the sections to give the notes a clear structure and because when i come to memorise the notes later, i find it easier to think: oh yeah, i remember here there were four sub-ideas and i'll then go through and simply identify each one in order. Having a topic skeleton helps with my overall understanding of the topic because i'm able to visualise how each of the different sub-topics fit together. It also prevents a situation where, having gone straight into making notes, i spend ages trying to get to grips with a section of the topic when in fact this will be explained or elaborated on later in the lecture or the notes coverage of the topic. It took me around 45 minutes, until about 11.15, to complete a topic skeleton for these notes, because there are around 180 pages of notes to get through in this introductory lecture note pack. However, with a standard 30 pages of notes or a one hour lecture, it would normally take me between 10 and 15 minutes a day. At this stage, you want to begin to condense what the lecturer and the lecture notes say into short note form- bullet points. The key here is that, rather than writing down every single word the lecturer says, you're actually computing and trying to understand what he or she is saying and then writing down the key ideas in a hierarchical bullet pointed list.\",\n",

The set of criteria which need to be fulfilled are what we call the gauss-markov assumptions, and assuming that each of these is satisfied, then ordinary least squares are a sort of useful thing to use on our sample. But how do we actually go ahead and test these certain criteria? Well, we need a sort of set of what we call diagnostic tests. And what these tests enable us to do is they enable us to test as to whether it's the case that these criteria are satisfied. And if each of these criteria are satisfied, that's fine. We can still use ols on our sample and that will enable us to make some sort of good estimate about the population parameters. But if these criteria aren't satisfying- so these diagnostic tests show us that they aren't satisfying- then ordinary least squares is no longer blue. And in this particular circumstance we need to define a whole sort of new set of estimators which may not be blue but they may possess some other sort of good property which an estimator might have, in particular consistency, and under a sort of set of less restrictive assumptions, they may happen to be blue or consistent. So some of the estimators we're going to discuss here are the sort of instrumental variables estimation, gls estimators and sort of maximum likelihood estimators. We may also talk a little bit about gmm, but we're going to keep that to a minimum. I should also mention that i'm going to try and make this course as non-mathematical as possible.\",\n",

Now i'm piecing together some things from the past and we know that there's been updated guidelines upon updated guidelines. My understanding is that whatever amount is not forgiven, the interest is going to start accrue at the date that you got the money originally, the disbursement date. So it's not really a strategy to say, well, i'm not going to be able to get any of this forgiven, for whatever reason, so i might as well just wait the 10 months past the end of my covered period because at least i'm deferring interest.

So there's a period of time where every one of us was able to speak but we were not literate. Okay, they're separate tribes living in the jungle with no dictionaries, no writing, no pens, no paper. They're able to speak and they spend their entire lives able to speak but not able to write. So writing systems, spelling, dictionaries, grammar books, these are not important to a language. They have some relations, some connection, but they're separate and you have to keep them separate because this tribe that lives in the jungle, they speak rule bound grammar. There are, there are rules to the language that they speak. Those rules were just never taught in english class. They acquired them naturally. What is language? Continued, all right, language behaves in ways that literacy does not. No one naturally acquires literacy. You have to go to school to learn how to read and write, and it takes years of practice and you have to do exercises and you have to first learn to write your letters and then learn to write simple words and you have to take spelling tests.

If the instructor was a native speaker of english language, one zero. Otherwise. If the professor was tenured, one zero, otherwise. I have produced some descriptive statistics for your reference, for instance for the continuous variables such as age and beauty, and teaching evaluation and the number of students who were enrolled in the course. On the number of students who performed the teaching evaluations, i produced the descriptive statistics such as the minimum, the maximum mean and standard deviation for categorical variables such as gender, female, yes or no, visible minority yes or no, person being a tenured professor or otherwise. I produced the frequency distributions and percentage of individuals falling in one category or otherwise. Notice that the teaching evaluation score is 3.99 with a standard deviation of 0.55. and let's see if i were to produce a histogram of this variable teaching evaluation, how will it look like with raw data? And if i were to use the normal distribution and feed the two parameters, that is, the mean and the standard deviation, how will the same distribution look like using a normal distribution? I am presenting here the distribution of the raw data on left side and the presentation of the same data with the same parameters- the mean and standard deviation- using normal distribution. You could see that the data not exactly following a bell curve- this is the raw data and it seldom does. But then the theoretical distribution looks like this: essentially the same data set with a mean of 3.998 and standard deviation is presented here, and then a normal distribution drawn from these two parameters appears here.\",\n",

In the last podcast we looked at the definition of educational research and the importance of educational research. Let's look now at the problems with educational research, discuss the process and look at some of the ethical considerations and consider some of the skills that you bring to the research process. A lot of problems occur with research today. Findings may be contradictory or vague. As a matter of fact, that's just the nature of statistics. It's very possible to take the same data set, same population rather, and do it like the data set and come up with different results on the same questions, and do it legitimately. Sometimes the data can be questionable. We can have unclear statements about the intent of the study. Or maybe we don't fully disclose the data collection procedure so a reader or consumer would not know how that affects the outcomes. Or maybe the research problem just wasn't rendered clearly or articulately enough. Now the process of research should really start with identifying the research problem to start with. Keep in mind that the very foundation is: what is the research problem? That guides everything else. Once one has identified a research problem. Then one conducts a review of the literature, and by literature we're talking about literature dealing with scholarly work regarding a problem. That might be journal articles, it might be a dissertation, that was done, but we're talking about peer-reviewed literature. Then, once the literature is reviewed, one would determine what is the research purpose. It might be that the literature indicated that the purpose was not really needed. It might be that the literature, a review of the literature, really caused a purpose to stand out and caused the study to narrow some. Once one has identified a problem, reviewed the literature and determined the purpose of the study, then one can begin to collect the data.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"We're going to need a lot. What about the? Suppose we have a pure state, and pure states feature a lot in quantum computation. Can any vector give us a pure state? And the answer turns out to be no. If you take the trace of row, then well, you're taking the trace of a column vector times by a row vector, and you can use the cyclic rule of trace right. Trace of ab is the same as the trace of ba, even when the matrices aren't square. So a is psi and b is psi dagger and you get psi dagger times by psi, and that's a number. So that number has to equal one. So not any old vector is allowed as a pure state. The vector further. Not any other vector. Psi from your hilbert space is allowed as a pure state. The vector must further have length one and another way of writing that is that the inner product between psi and itself is one. That's a quick side remark. So you'll often see in quantum mechanics textbooks people will define pure states first. They won't talk about density matrices at all. They'll say: pure states are vectors in hilbert space with length one. Now that's something that many textbooks do. I encourage you not to think this way. Because i encourage you not to think this way because in reality in quantum computation we will encounter generically and universally density matrices. We will encounter so-called mixed states, non-pure states. These appear most generally in quantum systems because every quantum system is under the influence of noise, and when you have noise acting on a quantum system, then that takes a system in a pure state to a mixed state. I don't expect you to understand that statement, but i will have it said that i'll just say it.\",\n",

These were the main programs that i wanted to feature, but i also have some kind of more honorable mentions. For example, if we go back to browser-based programs, we have selfcat here. Now the free definition is kind of sketchy here, since, while you can create all the models for free, if you actually want to download the model and an stl or something, you do have to pay your monthly subscription, which is like 15 bucks a month. It's not that expensive actually for 3d modeling programs. But the other reason why i wanted to feature this program is, while it is a very powerful program and has a lot of features, it is not parametric, and that's not a bad thing. It's just a very different way of working here. Instead of creating sketches and then basing all your designs on that we are, you can easily deform these, you can twist all of these designs and you can also directly edit the individual points. I could easily just move this individual point here. I can select this individual point and then move it around and modify my design in this way. There also is a sculpting workspace where i can actually use sculpting brushes to modify my design.

So sales revenue and freight: sales revenue and freight. The reason you don't see these other chart of accounts is because if we scroll over in our row sets- and we'll just make this bigger for now- under sales details you can see that we're suppressing empties and hiding zeros.\",\n",

By doing this, the gold stops being able to block the other metals from nitric acid, and you'll see why this is important later on. The most common and probably best metal to inquart with is silver, mostly because it's very easy to recover and to use in another run. However, i didn't have any silver, and this was just a one-time thing, so it made no sense for me to go out and to buy some just for this. I instead just used copper that i pulled out from a bunch of wire that i had left over after moving to my new office. I then weighed each of the chains and, based on their purity, i calculated how much copper was needed to knock it down to around that 6 carat point. For the larger one that i determined to be at least around 14 carats, i went ahead and assumed it was 18, just for the calculations. I did this because it was better to overestimate how much copper i needed than to not add enough. Now to mix the copper with it, i had to melt it all together. I'd done this before on a very small scale in a porcelain dish, but never with this much metal. There are many different setups that people use to do this, but i wanted to go with the simplest and the cheapest. From some videos that i saw, i found that it was possible to just do it with a paint can, some blowtorches and fiberglass insulation. So i ordered the fiberglass from amazon and i went and picked up the torches and the paint can from my local hardware store. Also, while i was on amazon, i picked up this small metal melting starter kit. Now, to put this whole can thing together, it was really easy.\",\n",

But for the purposes of general biology, what i'm giving you should get you through most of the problems that you're going to come in contact with.

The outer shell turns out to be so important we actually give it a name. We call it the valence shell. So we're going to talk about how they get to be happy right now. As we go through this, we're going to see that carbon is not happy by itself, whereas neon is. We're going to see why.

So in other words, jim came over to the brand new village where one of the american colonists lived- brand new village- and jim came over, he killed my goat. Well, currently there's no anti-goat-killing laws in our village, but there was an outcry. Jim- unfortunately for me and unfortunately for the village- cannot be prosecuted after he killed my goat because there was no law and he did not know that he had to curtail his behavior. He had to stop himself from killing my goat. There's no law on the books, there's no law against it. He was able to do that, but everyone was very upset about it and they had an outcry. And in response to that, we can assume that the village elders got together and they wrote a law: thou shalt not kill any goats, okay, without the owner's consent. Because maybe you bring it to your neighbor and say, hey, i don't really want to kill the goat, i need the meat. But you know, we're friends now, i've had him for a number of years but we're hungry. Can you kill him for me, because i just don't want to do it? That would be with consent. So i'm assuming that this law is: you know you're killing someone else's goat without their consent and you would have to establish some kind of punishment for that. If you do violate this law, then you're going to go to jail for a year and you're going to have to pay a fine of five goats to your neighbor or whoever's goat that you killed.

Our fundamental choice is choosing from this decision space what we want to express in the cell. Once we express that, we recurse on that decision. If the decision doesn't work, we come back and we undo it and we make another choice. We explore, we undo, we make another choice. So bring the code back right there. That's what our for loop is for. Our for loop is for exploration within the stack frame. This cell needs to explore one through nine. This cell explores one through nine. This cell explores nothing. It already has a number. This cell explores one through nine. So this is one approach to solving the sudoku problem. I don't know if there's a way faster than this, because this is pretty exponential in time, but anyway, this is how backtracking works. This is how it pans out in my mind. We make a choice, we adhere to constraints and we have a goal. So again, i've done many, many videos on this channel- super cool effects going on right there.

So in the previous episodes i mentioned already a couple of times that the context really matters, the context within an organization, and what might work in one company might not work in another company. And if this is true, then this is pretty much due to the different nature of different organizations, even in the same industry. And now comes the question: if you, as an hr executive, if you were supposed to describe your organization- let's say you have 20 minutes- what would you say? The question really is, how would you describe the nature of your organization? And you were supposed not to just talk around in an unstructured way, talking about randomly chosen criteria, things that spontaneously come to your mind, but to give a structured and relevant overview about the nature of your organization. To which dimensions would you refer to, which attributes would you describe, and what are the dimensions of these different attributes all about? So this is important. So in this episode, as well as in the next episode, i will guide you through a couple of criteria that are going to help you and all those listeners who work in an organization are really invited to reflect on their own environment. That's going to help. Well, all those criteria i'm going to share with you are of practical nature. I would say so. In the last years of my work, my research, i was always thinking about: okay, which kind of attributes, which kind of characteristics of organization are really relevant for practical implications? I mean really for practical implications, and not so much for scientific purpose. I must say really it's more about what is relevant for practice, for practical implications.\",\n",

The closer the knee goes to the wall, the more stretch you're going to get. Now, some people, when they stretch like this, they don't feel it much. You've got to make sure you actually come forward a bit away from your heel. So don't just sit back on the heel and try to come forward a bit. The reason for that is your rectus femoris comes up the top here. Once you get to that point, you then try and do a little bit of pelvic tilt. You see that.

She has no other symptoms. On exam she is afebrile pulse is 110, blood pressure is 110 over 85, respiratory rate 24, and o2 sat is 95% on room air. She has an elevated jvp and bi-basilar crackles.

If a pulmonary embolism is ruled in, should she be admitted to the hospital? To answer these questions, we could make an educated guess based on our experience and knowledge of pulmonary embolisms.

Now, generally you wouldn't be able to do the loan and also sell the real estate on the same transaction, but it's the same license: selling houses, financing houses, financing commercial real estate, selling commercial real estate. The reason i'm so excited about this is that there's so many ways to make a dollar with a real estate license in california: sell houses, do loans, do property management, do land deals. You know a bunch of ways to make money.\",\n",

So whenever i see the question paper, i am not interested in looking into the 1st and 5th at the first moment. First thing what i need to do is i have to select my choices within 1 or 2 minutes. I have to do that. So 1 and 5, i am not going to look into, but 1 and 5, blindly. I will start writing once i have selected my choices. And one more thing that i want to tell you is: you will see 20 markers here. So 20 markers i will give least priority. I will always write towards the end.

Also, you will come to know it is very easy to get 6 to 7 mark in your 10 marker question because you need to write very less and whatever you write, you can write it in a very good way.

As the distance between two charged particles approaches infinity, the electrostatic potential energy between the particles approaches zero. Now for this next question. Actually for both 6 and 7, it would be helpful to look at your textbook. The diagram shows you, in figure 5.3, that if you take two charges that would normally repel each other and you bring them closer together, you are going to increase the potential energy. But if they are going to attract each other, then as they get closer together the potential energy decreases. So in number 6, what's going on here is that you have like charges which repel, so as they are brought closer together the potential energy increases because the repulsive forces try to push them apart. But if they were opposite charges, as you brought them closer together, the potential energy would decrease because attractive forces pull them toward each other. The si unit of energy is the joule and when we analyze energy changes we focus on the portion that we single out for study, which is called the system, and everything else is called the surroundings. You can have an open system in which both matter and energy can be exchanged with the surroundings. We often see examples of a closed system in which energy can be exchanged but not matter, and this- figure 5.4, is an example of a closed system. If a person throws a baseball and the baseball is the system, then the surroundings are doing work on the system. If that baseball breaks a window, then the system is doing work on the surroundings. The mathematical equation for work is: work equals force times distance.\",\n",

But a second moment when we use, a second point i should make about past continuous is while. It's a good signal word to remember for past continuous. Sometimes you see while with past simple, but i wouldn't use it like that because it's not very easy to use correctly like that and it's usually past continuous. The idea of this word while means in the middle of, and so i would always use past continuous. Let me give you two examples. He interrupted me while i was giving my speech. If you're giving a speech at a wedding and somebody heckles you, somebody shouts something at you, they interrupt you. Well, we still have exactly the same line. He interrupted me while i was giving. I should do that in red again. So he interrupted me while i was giving my speech. It's exactly the same. You're in the middle of the speech and he interrupted you. Ok, so that would be the past simple and that would be the past continuous. Now, one thing i should also mention is that we can have two past continuous actions together, and this is because you can really have a timeline like this, with one action happening which is finished and two unfinished actions. For example, the sun was shining, the birds were singing and my friend came to see me. Yeah, the sun didn't finish shining when the friend came and the birds didn't finish singing. So, yeah, in this sentence i've used a different one. I was doing the housework while he was cooking, then alex arrived. So, again, it follows this pattern on the diagram. Ok, thanks for listening.

       "  'input_text': 'As discussed last time, some of this starts in the fall by not planting your cover crop very heavy. To make sure that biomass is manageable, about one bushel of small grain is enough. Many producers who have adopted planting into large cover are also using some form of rolling to lay the cover down before or at planting. These rollers not only push the cover down, but they also crimp the cover. This helps so that the cover crop will not stand back up, as well as starting the process of decomposition and nutrient release by keeping the cover crop in contact with the soil. In this scenario, this crop was sprayed with herbicide just prior to rolling. The next part is to make sure that your planter is set up to not wrap the cover crop while still making a good zone for the seed to be planted into, including proper closing of the seed trench. Many options are available for planters that can work in these scenarios, but discussing these options with others who are having success is a great place to start. When planting into cover crops, either make sure the crop is dead and somewhat dry, or live and growing. These are the two best ways to manage the cover crop so that your planter does not have issues cutting through the cover, creating hair pinning in the furrow. When a cover crop is in the process of dying, it can be hard to cut through. Of course, planting into cover is also no different than any other planting that you must make sure that the soil is dry. Many have found that a live, active growing cover crop will actually help pull moisture out of the soil, whereas a dead cover will keep soils wet. Once the cover crop is rolled and planted through, you now have a nice mat of biomass that will keep soil moisture in, as well as help to compete with weeds. This biomass will break down over time, re-releasing nutrition to the growing crop.',\n",

The learning outcomes of this seminar is what you are meant to learn after today's experience. So, following the completion of today's session, you should be able to define projects and project management. You will also be able to prioritise alternatives in the project selection process and understand the main components of projects. Then we're going to critically analyse and apply the different phases of the project management lifecycle. So let's start with understanding what projects are. There are endless definitions of projects by different authors, different approaches and different schools of thought. However, in short, we can condense all of this knowledge into the following definition: projects are ideas brought to life in a particular constrained environment with a beginning and an end, through the synergetic integration of knowledge, time, capital and other resources in a coordinated effort to achieve a set of smart objectives through a series of monitored tasks, which are divided into stages, are bounded by a specific scope and aimed at delivering quality by providing beneficial change and value to an organisation and its stakeholders. So, in other words, we have a clear understanding of what projects are. We are now going to look at what project management actually is. Now, project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to projects, to their activities, in order to meet or exceed the stakeholders' needs and expectations. Now, project management mainly deals with being able to balance different demands. Now, these demands typically involve time, your schedule. They also typically involve scope, the breadth of your project, the budget, all financial implications and the quality that your project is aimed to deliver.\",\n",

So, for example, one chemical formula you've probably heard of is h2o, so that's the chemical formula for water. Another one you might have heard of is carbon dioxide, is co2.. So these are just shorthand ways that express the type and the number of atoms. Okay, so here's another one. So h2so4 is sulfuric acid. Why don't we just take a second and break this down and try to decipher exactly what this is telling me? Okay, well, h, that's telling me that's the symbol for hydrogen. So there's hydrogen. How many hydrogens? Well, the subscript after the hydrogen tells me there are two hydrogens present. How about s? Well, s is the symbol for the element sulfur. Now notice, there isn't a subscript here. So if there isn't a subscript, we just assume that means there's only one, o, that's the symbol for oxygen, and the subscript is four. So there must be four oxygens. So sulfuric acid is composed of two hydrogen atoms, one sulfur atom and four oxygen atoms. Well, how about water? Well, water must be two hydrogens and one oxygen. Carbon dioxide must be one carbon and two oxygens. Now, sometimes in a chemical formula it's useful to use parentheses so we can clarify what's going on with the actual structure or the composition. So, for example, this molecule here is tnt, which is a very famous explosive i'm sure you've heard of. So tnt is c7h5, parenthesis no2, parenthesis 3..\",\n",

       "  'input_text': 'When a parameter is turned too far, the sound loses its definition and punch. As with any process, less is more. With digital limiters, release time is very important. The faster the release time, the more invisible the limiter can be. It jumps in quickly, controls the transients, then gets out of the way. The fastest digital limiters have a release time of only one millisecond. However, super fast release times can cause significant distortion. This is why most successful digital limiters have an auto release control which slows down the release time if the duration of the limiting is greater than a few milliseconds. The effective release time of an auto release circuit can be as short as a couple of milliseconds, or as long as 50 to 500 milliseconds. All of this is intended to make the digital limiter as invisible as possible. Part of the sonic aggressiveness of a fast release time comes from the distortion at low frequencies that can occur if the release time is too fast. Look ahead- the preview or look ahead function allows very fast or even instantaneous attack time, which is especially useful in a peak limiter to prevent overloads. This unit can effectively react to the transients before it has even occurred. This requires a delay line, so analog processors do not have a look ahead. When there is a look ahead, the attack time can be as short as we desire, controlling any peak that concerns us. Look ahead is only relevant when we want a short attack time, since if we want a long attack time then we probably also want to let the initial transients pass through. So look ahead is probably unnecessary for attack times longer than about 10 milliseconds. Crest factor control. Some compressors provide a crest factor control expressing decibels or a range from rms or full average to quantity peak through full peak.',\n",

Before we dive into logistic regression, let's take a step back and review linear regression. In another statquest we talked about linear regression. We had some data- weight and size. Then we fit a line to it and with that line we could do a lot of things. First, we could calculate r? Squared and determine if weight and size are correlated- large values imply a large effect- and second, calculate a p value to determine if the r squared value is statistically significant. And third, we could use the line to predict size given weight. If a new mouse has this weight, then this is the size that we predict from the weight. Although we didn't mention it at the time, using data to predict something falls under the category of machine learning. So plain old linear regression is a form of machine learning. We also talked a little bit about multiple regression. Now we are trying to predict size using weight and blood volume. Alternatively, we could say that we are trying to model size using weight and blood volume. Multiple regression did the same things that normal regression did. We calculated r squared and we calculated the p value and we could predict size using weight and blood volume, and this makes multiple regression a slightly fancier machine learning method. We also talked about how we can use discrete measurements like genotype to predict size. If you're not familiar with the term genotype, don't freak out, it's no big deal. Just know that it refers to different types of mice. Lastly, we could compare models. So on the left side we've got normal regression using weight to predict size, and we can compare those predictions to the ones we get from multiple regression, where we're using weight and blood volume to predict size.\",\n",

There was the wider context of support for the jacobites within great britain at the time that there was the assumption that because the jacobites had got to derby, that clearly they had more support than actually they did. And by the time they got to derby it became increasingly apparent that people were not turning out for the jacobites. So they had marched all the way down from scotland and through the northwest of england, then turned eastwards to derby, but they hadn't raised many men on their travels. They had been successful in their march, they hadn't been opposed, but they hadn't brought many people along with them. So fundamentally, another element of the decision was their support was thin, thinner than they expected, indeed, absolutely. And if they were going to march on to london then they were going to have to need more support than they had accrued already. And then the third element in broadening out is a diplomatic context. When bonnie prince charlie left the continent of europe to come across to scotland in late 1744, there was an assumption that france in particular, but also the vatican and to an extent spain, would provide some succor, some support for the jacobite rebellion. Particularly france, and indeed bonnie prince charlie's brother henry, was in france at the time, in 45,, seeking to bring together support. That support never materialized and by the time they reached derby in december 45, it was increasingly clear that the international context was not going to come through for them.

The score improvement program introduces a five-phased approach to initiating and managing a score improvement program. The racetrack shown here is a high-level diagram describing the five phases necessary to identify, structure, conduct and complete a score improvement program. While the projects are linear by definition, score supply chain improvement is never totally completed and it is best conceived as a continuous cycle of detailed improvement projects, while the scope and objectives of individual projects will change. The score framework provides a tailorable, standardized repository of performance metrics, processes and best practices to guide improvement teams. Score implementation begins with identifying the improvement motivation, forming a score improvement program, organization and delivery of score education. After that, it's time to set the scope. Included in these activities are documenting the business environment, defining the scope of the supply chain involvement in the improvement program, summarizing the business context for supply chain improvement, documenting and prioritizing the supply chain, collection of initial supply chain data and drafting the improvement program charter. This is followed by configuring the supply chain by focusing on mapping the current state of the supply chain through analyzing both metric and process performance. Important activities during this phase include score metric selection, detailed competitive requirements, benchmarking and gap analysis. This phase provides the basis for the project portfolio and benefits calculation used in the next phase. Once we complete the analysis section, we move to the optimization section. Here we focus on grouping performance gaps into projects, calculating a metric benefit for each project and prioritizing the projects into implementation waves. The result is a portfolio of operational defects contained within each project, as well as the opportunities and benefits. We're now ready for implementation and to implement with full confidence that we are implementing a program that will show a definite return on our investment.

What we can now do is we can now make it to a professional level. So let's go to select the whole track. I'm going to go to effects and i'm going to click on amplify. Now what we want to do is we want to set it to minus 0.1 db, so it's just shy of 0 db. That way you can guarantee that there's going to be no clips, no digital overs, no, nothing like that. So when you upload it, it's not going to start making that horrible clipping sound. When you render this to mp3, it may bring it down to minus 1 db, but anyway, we'll just make sure that it's good to start with. So here we go. So when you click on this, you'll see quite a dramatic change. Actually, when it's done this and it should bring it up to a nice, there we go, a nice, professional, clean level. So now, if you play this at the loudest point, it shouldn't sound distorted clips and we shouldn't have red lines appearing here to say that it's clipping. Just check other parts. Excellent, it's loud, but it's not too loud, so that's all good. So now you've done that, you can now go file you want to export as an mp3 and name your file and save it somewhere, preferably not on your desktop.

The team was pretty small, which meant that i got to have ownership over large pieces of the app. I can't talk too much about exactly what i did, but i definitely learned a lot. In late 2020, luke had purchased a lot of 50 iphone 4s and 4ss from ebay. His original idea was just to clean them up, see how many of them worked and play around with them. But i had another idea: maybe i could build an app that would connect all of the iphones together to do cool things. When i moved to dc, the project started in earnest and once i had a working prototype, luke ordered 50 more iphones so that we could have 100.. The resulting project is an app and server called multiphone that links all 100 iphones together and turns them into a giant video screen, a chess board, a deck of cards and more. You can check out my video explaining exactly how the app works. I'm really proud of it. This project is another example of starting small and working my way up. When i first had the idea, i didn't even know if it was going to be possible. These phones are pretty old, so i'd have to figure out what version of xcode i needed to use and see if i could even build and run apps on these old phones. Once i got that figured out, i had to make sure that the phones could communicate with the server in reasonably close to real time. Once all of the experimentation was done and i felt confident that i could build the app, i worked on one feature at a time until i had enough features to call the project finished and make a video on it.\",\n",

Your interior finish is something other than concrete- it can be sheetrock, whatever- but the outside is your concrete finish. Then the insulation is on the inside. If you're doing concrete on the inside and you're going to have insulation on the outside, then you'd use a system like ephus exterior insulation finishing systems. You can build a concrete wall and you can put insulation on that wall and then have a stucco finish or a fiber cement panel finish or really any material finish on the outside, but your concrete will not be visible from the outside. It would be visible from the inside. Then you would have an interior concrete wall. You can then use icf, which is insulated concrete forms. This gives you concrete in the middle and insulation on both sides. What's the problem with this? There's no exposed concrete. If you're going to build a concrete house, i would expose the concrete, or at least expose it in certain areas. Of course, you may not like the aesthetic of concrete, but you like the idea of building with concrete for its strength, durability and fire rating. Then this might be something you want to take into consideration. I personally have never used icf. Then the most expensive option is concrete on both sides. We have concrete on the exterior of the house and concrete on the inside of the house. In this instance, you're going to have to put your insulation down the middle. You make your concrete forms wide enough to have two layers of concrete wall and then they put rigid insulation down the middle of the form and you pour it all at one time.

But what if we added a lot more tools? Then this would just become ridiculously long and unmaintainable. We then have the square tool and the line tool, and these require knowing where the left mouse button was first clicked on the canvas and then where the left mouse button was then released on the canvas. Furthermore, they both require you to sort of draw a preview of the line or square before they're actually drawn onto the canvas. As of this, the implementation of these tools is sort of split between two places, the first place being where the functions for these different tooltypes is actually called from, and the second place being where the preview of the line and the square is actually drawn. And this is bad because it means if you want to find the implementation of these tooltypes, then it means you have to go to two completely different locations in the code. The final main reason why this code is not so good is because it's basically just one giant multi-level nested switch statement, which eventually will just become to be very unreadable. But now for the question: what exactly is the strategy design pattern and how can it improve this code? The basic idea is it just allows you to select an algorithm during the runtime of a program that fit the needs of whatever's going on with the current time. How this works is you have some base class or interface, known as a strategy, which is then used by some other part of the program, and then classes will implement the strategy, interface of which is able to be used by the main program as well as switch between during runtime.\",\n",

It's a right triangle, it's one of the simplest triangles. We know a lot about it and in this case we know the hypotenuse equals 1.. So that's very nice. That's one of the nice things about using a unit circle. And now what we're going to do is what we're going to say: is this function, whatever it is? We don't know what it is, we have to figure it out, but what we will say it is is that the sine of this angle equals the opposite, which notice that equals y over divided by the hypotenuse. So i went from opposite, over hypotenuse, to the height, which is y, divided by the hypotenuse, which is 1, because it's a unit circle. Anything divided by 1 is y, and so what we see is that basically, the height here, y, is given by sine of theta. So let me clear this up and let me try to write this out. So if we wanted to do theta, x and y, what we know is: whatever y is is, by definition, the sine of theta. Now, we don't know what this is yet, but whatever it is, it's the function that if we give it, if we know what the angle is, think about it this way: we have theta and we stick it into a box, it does something called the sine function on it and that will return y in the unit circle, this value. Similarly, if i do the same thing, i can do the cosine and i go through the same argument and the cosine is adjacent, divided by the hypotenuse.\",\n",

Analgesia, particularly avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates, if possible, only taking clear liquids and avoiding solid food until symptoms improve, usually within 2-3 days, and follow up within 2 days to review the symptoms.

Everything is actually fine, go figure. I started by making a mixture of 2 to 1 black and brown oil paint to which i added white spirits. I don't entirely know what viscosity to shoot for, so i just mixed up something that seemed thin enough to apply through an airbrush. You can totally apply this with a paintbrush and it works amazingly, but i decided to use an airbrush to expedite the process. Applying an even layer of this stuff over a large surface is very quick with an airbrush. And here's a disclaimer: this stuff is probably awful to breathe in. While i was doing this, i was wearing a respirator, i had an air purifier running, and i had a fan running in an area pointed at an open window. I hope that i appeased the youtube health police with this grand gesture of safety. Seriously, though, this is not water-based acrylic paint.\",\n",

Assuming you got the right amount of loan, you're at full forgiveness. You're done. That's it. That's all you get. Now check this out. If you're a partner and you got the ppp based on being a partner and having self-employment earnings, it's still the 20,833, but when you read on pages 13 and 14, it seems that- and you'll just need to go and check this out- you're taking that amount then times 92.35%. Why? Because it's accounting for self- employer portion even though you don't have a quote unquote employer, but it's providing for half of the self-employment tax. If you're a partner and you got it that way- which seems really rare that partners got that- check out pages 13 and 14, check with your professional. If you don't have a partnership, just wash this 92.35% from any of your thinking. If you do not have a partnership, that you got money based on you being a partner. If you have a partnership and you paid employees. What i just said about the 92.35% has nothing to do with that.

Now, four-fourths is the whole circle that's shaded here and four-fourths here is the whole circle. We have one circle here, one whole circle here and one-fourth of a circle here. So we have two and one-fourth. See two and one-fourth. But there must be a better way to show it. This is a nice little illustration, but maybe there's another way, and there certainly is, and that way is an arithmetic process, and it's a process that works like this. Remember, in the last chapter, when we talked about whole numbers, we said that in the division process we can request the division of whole numbers using a fraction. And if we just think about it like that, think about the fraction like this: this is nine divided by four. You see now, so this is a fraction bar, but it also is a request for division, or it can be thought of like that, in order to make the change from improper fraction to mixed numbers. So we have, let's see, nine divided by four. Well, that's four into nine. Let's see, four into nine goes two times. Two times four is eight. We subtract and get one. So we have two wholes, you see, in this process, but one left over. So we have two with one left over.\",\n",

An additional concrete cover of at least 50 millimeters has to be considered up to plinth level to protect the rebar for possible corrosion due to sulfate attack. Seven: concreting of column and bitumen paint applications. Once the concreting of stub columns has been completed, give time for the concrete to dry completely and apply at least two coats of bitumen paint for both footing and stub columns. Bitumen paint helps in absorbing moisture due to the soil to prevent seepage into the substructure concrete. Eight: setting up perimeter blocks. Install solid blocks along the perimeter or the edge of the proposed project. This is to establish a boundary between the inside and outside edges of the project. It is also helpful when the difference of inside floor finish level to outside pavement or ground level is significant. Two coats of bitumen paints should also apply afterward. In some cases perimeter blocks are optional, especially for areas where the soil characteristics are too firm. Nine: backfilling and compacting. Once the substructures, like foundation structures, including the solid blocks, have been installed completed, backfilling and compacting should take place.

Is that the people who built kubernetes assume that there's going to be platforms on top of this and you weren't really going to be playing with these lower level apis. And yet, surprise, surprise, folks played with the lower level apis because they have devops teams that were messing around with this, that and the other.

Who's this aimed at? People who are. Who's this aimed at? People with a broad scientific background who at least are comfortable with probability theory and linear algebra? And well, let's get right to it. So what i'm going to do is present to you quantum mechanics. But i'm not going to teach you all of quantum mechanics. That takes a full semester at the at the end of an undergraduate degree. I'm going to tell you about not quantum mechanics, but i'm going to tell you about something that we could call simplified quantum mechanics. Now i'll try and be very precise about what is being simplified here and what you're missing out on and what you're gaining. So to teach quantum mechanics properly, you do need a good grounding in all of physics so you can sort of place the theory of quantum mechanics in context, and that takes many, many years of an undergraduate degree. However, and further, you need to be comfortable, you need to really engage with infinite dimensions to do quantum mechanics as a physical theory justice.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"One is an editor and two is a database. Let's talk about database first. Databases are an organized collection of data, so large companies use these databases in order to store their vast amounts of information. Typically, programmers and even data engineers are utilized in order to build systems around collecting this data. Since we're talking about large amounts of information, we typically don't want to use things like text files or excel files, because they have pretty small data limitations. Databases have much larger data limitations. So once these databases are designed and set up by these programmers and data engineers, as a data analyst i can then go in and use sql in order to query these databases. Now, the structure of the language or syntax of sql to query a database is actually quite simple. So let's say, youtube has a database full of information. Inside this database, there are different tables for every youtube channel that include their list of subscribers. We'll say there's a table in there for this channel and it's titled data nerd channel, with an entry for each subscriber of my channel. Each one of those rows in the table has information like name, channel id and the number of comments they've given. Now i want to get a list of all my subscribers. I then can use the following syntax, which has a select statement and a from statement, so select is used to identify the column of interest that we want to grab, and from is used to identify the table we want to connect to. When i send this query to the database, it then will provide me back a list of all my subscribers. Now sql can be used in a lot more different ways. For example, we can actually use it to go in further and analyze the data, such in this case, where we can add on a where statement to filter our data further based on how many users commented more than 100 times.\",\n",

Now the next topic is benefits of agreement. Remember one thing: the primary benefit of an agreement that does not meet the criteria of contract is that it is inherently informal. Where the agreeing parties have a long-standing relationship and share a considerable degree of trust, the use of non-contract agreement can save time and allow for more flexibility in the fulfillment of the agreed upon obligations. What does that mean? Basically, remember, agreement means the mutual consensus between two or more parties and it is an informal way. So it is a very quick and just understand make and understanding between two or more parties and we can start an agreement by agreeing with, with, with the parties. So it is a very informal way and it is a very quick way to, and it's also save time or as well and flexible as well. So agreement means the understanding, mutual consensus between two or more parties. It is safe, time, quick, flexible and fulfill the requirements. Benefits of contract. The main advantage of contract is that they spell out the specific terms that the contracting parties have agreed upon and, in the event of a breach, where one or more parties fail to fulfill their obligations, serve as a guide to for a court of law to determine the proper remedy for the injured, for the injured party or parties. The main benefit of contract is that it is basically a very formal way of mutual consensus and the terms and conditions, so in case of any breach of any terms and condition, it can be challenged in the court of law. So this is basically the very basic and the very major con advantage of a contract: that the terms and conditions are very are very strict and in case of any breach from any party, so it can be challenged and can be put into a court of law.\",\n",

The big one that everyone thinks of here is benefits. People see, oh look, there's benefits. Why should i work? I may as well get benefits. So this disincentivises people from working. So it leads to more unemployment, because people think i can earn just as much if i'm on benefits as if i'm working, so they collect their benefits. This leads to productive inefficiency within the economy, because less is not all. The factors of production are really being used to their full maximum output, so we're not on the production possibility boundary. Moving on to the second load of government failures, one is when the policy decisions are based on imperfect information. For example, less and less people are voting every year. The people that are voting tend to be the older people who are going to die soon. So the government obviously has to follow the older people's ideas, which means that the policies it implements aren't necessarily the ones that are going to be best for the society of tomorrow. This is why it's really important for everybody to vote, because the government doesn't know what the public wants. People who vote don't necessarily understand the policies. It means it's government failure because the wrong thing is happening for the economy. It's not necessarily what will be best for the economy and the future generation. Next we have the law of unintended consequences, which is when the actions of consumers, producers and the government actually has an unanticipated effect. Obviously we've already done the benefits. We think, ooh, it's going to have equity, but actually it leads to more unemployment. Another one is a tax on a demerit good, for example cigarettes.\",\n",

Now we are interior z28 camaro day. We won't need this line again. I would say. Parked rather than not moving. Twyla's in the driver's seat, short hair. I guess we're going to sense that she's now fully awake. She looks over at maybe give her a dazed. Either she's fully awake or she's dazed, but now awake. We are interior z28 camaro, parked, a bit dazed, still a bit dazed. She looks over at some dipshit. Until we get blown up at page nine. This might be an opportunity to through the windows.

I think better just remind us that her name is twyla, some dipshit, and then the rest of the scene would play the same. So those are two choices for how you might get into this. I'm guessing that they do mean for this to be a sort of reveal that we're going from one place to another.\",\n",

They are normal responses to thoughts. Everybody feels anxious and they have a purpose. You know, it's good to feel anxious. Sometimes it gets us away from danger. The trouble is, sometimes our mind tricks us into thinking there is danger when there really is none. The vicious cycle of stress. Everybody gets stressed at times. Stress is about too many demands being made on us and we don't have the resources to cope. So, in response to a trigger, we tend to think there's too much to do, there's not enough time, it's out of control. I can't cope. So we feel very stressed. We get that drip feed of adrenaline and cortisol, the stress hormone, which results in these horrible physical feelings all the time: tense headaches, forgetful, and all that sort of thing. So what do we do? Well, if we haven't got enough time, then we might try and make more time at work in order to try and fit in everything we've got to do. Or we might think i can't cope with going to work at all and just stay home. You might avoid and put things off lots of different things. You might sleep more, sleep less, drink more, smoke more, shout, argue, less family or fun time. It affects us in all different ways and if we don't make any changes in the way we think and in the way we behave, then nothing is going to change. We need to understand our vicious cycle to help us to make positive changes. We need to break the cycle. We can break the cycle by thinking differently, by changing the way we think and doing differently, changing the way we behave.\",\n",

I was in the schreyer honors college and one of the requirements was to write an honors thesis. I did research with a professor in the field of natural language processing, which is concerned with how computers can understand and interact with human language. I did experiments on an algorithm that was developed in our lab that attempted to automatically grade summaries written by students for school assignments. The algorithm basically worked like this: first, a few experts would write summaries that we know are good, which we call golden summaries. Then, using software built in our lab, someone would break down each golden summary into fragments called summary content units, where each scu expressed a single idea. Then they would link scus from different golden summaries that express the same idea. The theory is that the more summaries a particular idea appears in, the more important that idea is then to grade student-written summaries. Our algorithm would break the summaries down into scus, compare the student scus to the golden scus and score the summary. I experimented with changing parameters and using different models to encode words, among other things. Overall, i personally found research to not be as enjoyable as programming, but i learned a lot about nlp and further developed my interest in the field. This led me to take a class that was run by the lab's professor, which i enjoyed a lot, and i also got to write a thesis, which is pretty cool. I also did a few internships in the summer between high school and college. I worked at lockheed martin for about a month. I worked on some internal websites that are probably long since gone, and the internship wasn't particularly exciting, but it was a good first experience.\",\n",

The plan helps maintain the flow of the project meeting to achieve the outcomes. It also helps discuss only the required information and complete the meeting in the right duration. Next third technique is send the agenda and objectives before the meeting. The schedule and the created objectives are sent to the people in advance. It would help them in preparing for the meeting. Without the plan and objectives they will not know anything about the meeting. Therefore, the people should collect suggestions in advance of the meeting. If the suggestion is acceptable, then the plan is modified. Next, the fourth technique is invite only the crucial people. The project meetings are crucial and hence only the right people are invited to attend the meeting. People who are involved in meeting the project meeting objectives are only invited. If the responsible person is not available, the delegation should be made to someone who can fill that position. The people are invited through the mail and should get a confirmation for attending. The fifth technique is schedule the meeting environment effectively. The mode of the meeting is also planned. There are several modes, like physical meetings, video conferencing and audio conferencing. The suitable mode of communication is selected and notified to the team members involved in the meeting. The meeting's location, time and duration are also communicated to the team. Next, the sixth technique is keep time bounded. Not everyone is only based on meetings. People will have different other tasks following. Thus, meetings should be started and completed on time. The duration of the meeting plan should not exceed the meeting agenda, and objectives will be highly helpful in complying with the time duration of completion. The delay of the meetings is avoided by following the plan. Next, the seventh technique is assigning roles for meeting. The meeting should be interactive. To achieve this, each and everyone involved should communicate in the meeting.\",\n",

If we later change any of the ingredients or conditions, we can push the reaction in the opposite direction to undo that change. Instead of dissolving calcite, we move to the left and the calcite mineral precipitates. How does that happen? When carbon dioxide gas decreases in water? Going back to the first reaction, that means there's less carbonic acid. Less carbonic acid in this reaction will drive the equation to the left to produce more. The ions will recombine to produce more calcite and it will precipitate. So the primary cause of calcite precipitation is actually the reduction of carbon dioxide in the water that has the dissolved ions in it. What makes carbon dioxide leave water? What can you do to get bubbles of carbon dioxide coming out of your soda? First thing you can do is open the cap and reduce the pressure on it. Immediately you will see the carbon dioxide gas bubbling out. This is exactly what happens when water exits a crack through a hole in the roof of an empty cavern. The water is coming from an environment where it was trapped in a crack in a rock under high pressure. Now it enters a cavern where the pressure is much less. You've just opened the soda can the carbon dioxide gas comes out of the water that's come out of the crack and that causes calcite to precipitate, small crystals will form around the water droplet and add to the thickness and length of the stalactite that's forming. When a drop of that water later hits the ground under the stalactite, more carbon dioxide gas will leave the water and more calcite will precipitate and form the stalagmite. It's just like when you shake your soda can when it's open.\",\n",

In which theory does your company, the people in your organization, the ceo, the executives, the supervisor, the employees, really believe? So here is the first theory. Douglas macgregor named the theory theory x. i don't know why. The other one is theory y. i forgot why he named it that way, but it does not matter. So here is theory x and i quote from his book. It's a summary of the theory, so i quote: people have an inherent dislike for work and will avoid it whenever possible. People must coerce. People must be coerced, controlled, directed or threatened with punishment in order to get them to achieve the organizational objectives. People prefer to be directed, do not want responsibility and have little or no ambition. People seek security above all else. That's it. That's theory x.

Mm-hmm, evolution- okay, i'm going to describe it slightly differently. There's going to be a new word here. Closed. All right, now we're doing quantum circuits. Already the evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary matrix: u and u has to act on l hilbert space. Now, maybe you don't remember what a unitary matrix is. A unitary matrix is one where, if you take the adjoint, multiply it by u, you get the i, and that is the same as if you do u times, u dagger. Now, any quantum. What does closed mean? Closed means that the quantum system is effectively completely shielded from the environment. What's the environment? Well, everything. That's not the quantum system, right? So the qubit perhaps, if we're thinking about a qubit, has to be sort of hermetically sealed in some kind of chamber and nothing from the environment is allowed to interact with the qubit. If we're going to look at the quantum system, nothing from the environment is allowed to interact with the qubit. If we're in an example of a closed quantum system, the minute we do a measurement on a quantum system, we're actually interacting with it. That's very crucial. The only way information can get out of a quantum system is by a measurement, and the minute you do a measurement, this quantum system is no longer closed. You open up a little window and you take a look in, and by looking in you're interacting with the system. This is something you should get used to. In quantum mechanics, information gain leads to disturbance of the system.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"Rays, like lines and segments, are made up of points and are straight. A ray differs from a line or segment in that it begins at an end point and then extends infinitely far in one direction only. Segments extend in two directions. Rays extend in one direction only, so make sure you keep that in mind. The following are examples of rays. Now, when it comes to denoting them, we actually need to be careful and make sure we start denoting a ray by naming its end point first. This way, it becomes clear where the ray begins. So the ray in the left is denoted as ray ab. Notice that we add a ray on top, going from left to right. This is the appropriate way to denote rays. It would be completely wrong to denote the ray as ray ba. Remember, we want to start with the end point first. The ray in the right can be called ray rs or ray rt, as long as the end point is given first. Any other point on the ray can be used to denote the ray. Now that we know about points, lines, segments and rays. We can now talk about angles. In essence, an angle is made up of two rays with a common end point. This point is called the vertex of the angle. The rays are called sides of the angle. There are various ways that angles can be described and denoted. For example, if we place the number 1 inside the angle near the vertex, like this, we would denote this angle as angle 1.. The symbol that we use to denote angles is drawn as follows. It's essentially a picture of an angle. If the angle only contains one letter in the vertex, then you denote it as angle a. When you denote the angle using one letter, make sure you name the point on the vertex. An alternative way is needed if the angle is described in terms of three points.\",\n",

If you remember hive, that actually is a similar thing as well, but again, since hive is more tightly integrated into hadoop, i chose to leave it out of this particular circle, but it too is a way of querying your data. Apache drill- pretty cool stuff. It actually allows you to write sql queries that will work across a wide range of nosql databases potentially. So it can actually talk to your hbase database and maybe your cassandra and your mongodb database as well and tie those results all together and allow you to write queries across all those disparate data stores and bring them all back together when you're done. Hue, also a way of interactively creating queries. It works well with hive and hbase and actually for cloudera it kind of takes the role of ambari for sort of the thing that sits on top of everything and lets you visualize and execute queries on the hadoop cluster as a whole. Apache, phoenix, kind of similar to drill. It lets you do sql-style queries across the entire range of data storage technologies you might have. But it takes it one step further.

Possibly used between wheat and another fall crop. That gives us an option. We can also harvest this for forage. It can make excellent forage. So one thing about berseem that i learned a lot about this last year and prevent plant acres up in minnesota and wisconsin was the fact that it does not have a real deep root system, so it needs a little more moisture than what we would see on some of our other cover crops. It makes a good cover crop, makes an excellent forage, but does not have the depth of root. On crimson clover we found roots 34 inches deep on clover that's 2 inches tall, so i mean it's a real massive root producer. You won't find that with berseem clover. Yellow blossom sweet clover is a very good clover as well, excellent soil builder, maybe one of the best soil builders. But there's only one big monster problem with sweet clover: it's a host to soybean cyst nematode. So if you have soybeans in your rotation, choose not to use this. If you're going corn after corn for the next 20 years, think about it. But it's not something that we put back in rotations anymore.

Now i don't want your lower back moving into flexion or extension or anything like that. You want to make sure that your lower back is in neutral. Your core is on to keep it stable through there, and so when you drop down, you bend the right knee, but only hinging. I'm not letting that right knee, so my loaded leg. I'm not letting that go forward. I'm letting the weight drop down as it drops down. My left leg is the counterweight and this right hand is simply there for a bit of balance to stop me sort of wobbling all over the shop and tilting like this until i get the right position and learn my stability. So sometimes it's really helpful to have a mirror to look at. So if i'm looking in the mirror, i can see what my lower back is doing and making sure when i'm going down i'm not rounding forward like that and dropping down. You'll notice that i lose balance when i do that because i lose my core. So if you find that you're wobbly, it may be that because you're trying to round down like this. The other thing i don't want you doing is making sure you don't turn into a squat.

The first thing i wanted to know was the purity of gold in each of them, and to do this, i just looked for a stamp. I was able to find one on three of them, where two of them were marked as 18 carat and the other one was marked as 14.. one of the smaller ones wasn't marked, though, and the clasp of this one had broken off, where it was probably written. So now, because i didn't have a real idea of what these chains were made of, i had to test them. There are a lot of different ways that this test can be done, but i just used what i had on hand, which was concentrated nitric acid. So to the big chain. I made a deep scratch in it, dropped it in the acid and left it there for a few minutes. Gold jewelry comes in different carats and it refers to the purity of the gold. 24 carat is 100% and everything else is based on a fraction of that. So, for example, with 18 carat gold, it means that the pure fraction is 18 over 24, or 75%. The other 25% is often made of other metals like copper, silver or iron, which both change its color and make the gold more durable. Nitric acid is able to react with most metals and dissolve them, but some metals, like gold, are really resistant. At lower carats- below around 8 or 10,, the acid can eat around the gold atoms and dissolve the other metals. However, when we start getting up to 12 or 14 carat, the gold is able to block the acid.\",\n",

These are mutually responsive or mutually supportive. So, although they are based on opposite theoretical assumptions, but while comparing both, the relationship between the two is understood to be complementary rather than contradictory. Guys, do not tell, sociology is difficult. After this, critically examine the dialectics involved in each mode of production, as propounded by karl marx. So what do you do here? So here is where we discussed about marx s theory of historical materialism. At the same time, you will get more content from here. Here, this one dialectical materialism also. So take dialectical materialism concept from here and combine it with the dialectics involved in each mode of production, which you learn from historical materialism as well. Anyway, this you do not have any confusion, i am sure about that. Then weber s idea of bureaucracy, which chapter it is: authority and bureaucracy. So here you will find that authority and bureaucracy i have discussed over here.

They represent the different manners of articulation or the way that you can cut up the airflow as it passes through your vocal tract. These generally go in the chart from most closed to most open, so from top to bottom. So up top we have plosives, which are also known as stops. Like you'd guess from the name, these are pronounced by stopping the air completely and then letting it go again. Our old friends pə, tə and kə are here, as well as bə, də and gə, and of course there are other stops too, like the qə that we talked about earlier. Whenever you're pushing air from your lungs and it can't escape from your mouth until you let go, that's a stop. But what if you stop air from getting out of your mouth but you leave another escape route, like, say, through your nose? Down one row we have the nasals, your ns and ns, but also the ng we saw before. Here the air only comes out of your nose. There's a complete stop in your mouth, but you lower your soft palate and the air rushes out the only way it can: through your nasal cavity. That's why when you have a cold and your nose is plugged up, your ns sound a lot like dəs, də and nə are the same sound if you take your nose away. The next rows are for sounds that are like stops, but just executed really rapidly. Trills involve closing and opening the airflow multiple times quickly in the same place, just drumming one articulator against another.\",\n",

Instead of just like a one-page reading, because, especially for students who maybe don't find a lot of joy in reading or look at a page and feel kind of overwhelmed, a resume is more of a bullet point style, which means that it's a little easier for our students to follow and it gives you the highlights, these key details of these individuals without burdening them.

Think of the budget also as a financial interpretation of the scope, objectives, the client and quality. The project schedule is also a fundamental component of project management. The schedule are the planned dates for starting and completing activities and milestones. A milestone is a significant event in the project and usually completion of a major deliverable. Think about it as a checkpoint that involves zero time and zero effort. Objectives and schedule need to be integrated with each other because, depending on how much time we have, we are going to have an implication on the cost. So to know the timeline of the project in one or more of the following terms- as a milestone, deliverables, activities and deadlines- is essential in order to provide sound financial planning. There are different tools that can be used for organising the schedule of a project. Here we can have a look at some of them. On the top part, we can see a gantt chart. Now notice how, on the left hand side, we have identified the activities on a sequential numbering and they specify the duration of the activity. We also have a description of the tasks and then we assigned a specific start and finish dates. Now, on the right hand side of this gantt chart diagram, we see several bars with a timeline on top.

The goal is to charge the water by connecting it to a generator that could produce an electric charge. When kleist then touched the foil with his hand, he experienced a very strong electric shock, one that was arguably life-threatening. But what was going on was that the jar was storing electricity. This became known as a leyden jar. That name may not be familiar to some of you, but the leyden jar is also considered the first ever capacitor. Capacitors exist in all sorts of electronics nowadays, and what they do is store charge. Most people who will be taking a basic physics class can expect to learn some basic circuit analysis with these. Now the applications of capacitors have a wide range. Store charge can be used to represent binary within a digital system. It can be used to supply large amounts of current to things like lasers and particle accelerators. They can be used as sensors. They can adjust the power in high voltage systems as needed, and so on. Moving on, when isaac newton was alive, he became a very powerful figure in the scientific community. Very few were willing to challenge his ideas, and this continued even after his death. But he was not right about everything. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, thomas young would challenge isaac newton's view of optics. In 1678, the scientist christian huygens actually proposed that light was a wave, but isaac newton disregarded this and put forward his own theories.\",\n",

The owner then has an ownership interest in the building, but so does the creditor, that is, the mortgage lender. If the building cost $1 million and the owner put down 20%, then the owner has a $200,000 interest in the building. The creditor has an $800,000 interest in the building. The same thing is true of auto loans. When you finance the next car you purchase through the credit union, then you make a down payment, which means you have ownership interest in the automobile, but the credit union does as well. You hold legal title to the car, but the credit union is shown on the title as a lien holder. You would both have equity in the car. Well, we said that the process of accounting requires us to keep track of the business assets and the equity in those assets. Let's look at a more concrete example. Here we have a business and the owner of the business. The owner of the business is pictured on the right side of the screen here, and the business is represented by the basket. Let me encourage you to think of the business as a basket, and right now the business doesn't exist. It's only an idea in the mind of the owner. In order for the business to be started, it has to have assets with which to operate, and one place that the business can obtain assets is from the owner. So, in order to start up the business, the owner may make a contribution of assets to the business- things like cash, equipment, buildings and other types of assets. When the owner makes a contribution to the business, then there are assets placed in the basket that weren't there previously.\",\n",

So look at each noun themselves and the accompanying verbs that go with them. Okay, next we're going to talk about writing style. So in our breakdown of these papers, we found that overwhelmingly the passive voice and wordiness accounted for the majority of style issues, and i want to reiterate what i had said earlier, that this is not a hard and fast rule to say don't use the passive voice, only use the active. Far from it. And editors have a difficult time discerning when the author would like us to use the passive and active. It's simply regardless of how good the editor is, they have to make that call, and it could change your meaning, your intended meaning, to some extent. So you want to be able to make that decision for yourself. So, regarding the use of active passive voice, it's advisable to use the active if you can with an agent.

The code that you write to solve synchronization problems is maybe more complex and kind of dumb. But these are toy problems we give you to help you think about synchronization. If you don't get them, it doesn't matter. That stuff doesn't affect the performance of your kernel.

It's got one more proton therefore, than it does electron. So it has an overall positive charge. So the m plus peak is telling us, because it's a molecular ion, m plus molecular ion.

The feeling is like holding a baby and looking into its eyes. You feel this radiant loving kindness in your heart. Or perhaps a puppy or a kitten? Whatever brought you this feeling of kindness, of warmth, you let it be there. You didn't try, you just allowed. Feel that happy feeling. Now a really helpful technique is to smile. Put a little smile on your lips, just a little one, a buddha smile. Smile from your heart and smile from your mind. Smiling can pull you out of negative states and thinking. Smile during your whole sitting. Always come back to a feeling of happiness with a smile. Now take this happy feeling and radiate it to yourself. Help it along with some phrases like: may i be happy, may i be content, may i be peaceful. Don't just say these phrases like a mantra. You need to feel them and only use phrases as reminders of that warm, beautiful feeling. Phrases are not the object, they're only to nudge along this beautiful feeling, this feeling of loving kindness. Now sit with your back reasonably straight, not too tight. Don't move your body at all, don't wiggle your toes, don't wiggle your fingers, don't scratch, don't rub, don't change your posture, don't rock back and forth. Sit very still like a buddha statue and remember, on every buddha statue the buddha is smiling with a little smile, smile of equanimity, of happiness. When you don't move, it's like getting water to freeze. You can observe the water, but you can't push it or move it.\",\n",

It's a function that maps out outcomes, that is, points in a probability space. So probability space essentially is all possible outcomes. If you roll a die, it can have one out of six outcomes. So that's the probability space there. If you roll two dice, you can have one out of 36 outcomes, where each outcome could be considered a random outcome. And a probability distribution is a theoretical model that depicts the possible values any random variable may assume, along with the probability of its occurrence. We'll define this more with examples using two dice. So consider two dice. A die has six faces. If you roll two dice, it can assume one out of 36 discrete outcomes. So if you were to roll two dice, the probability that both die would have one as the outcome would be one plus one, two, and there's only one possibility of getting that and that's one out of 36.. So here we have two die, one black and one white. And if you were to look at the possibility of getting one on black and two on white, and that's one outcome, and so that's one plus two, is three. Or you can have two on black and one on white, that's two plus one, three again. So there are two ways of getting three on by rolling two dice. So the outcome, or the probability, is two out of 36 possible outcomes that are mapped out here. So if you think about the sum of two dice being two, there's only one possibility out of 36.. getting a three, you have two possibilities. Getting a four, you have three possibilities. Getting a five, you have four possibilities, and so on, so forth.\",\n",

It's probably the class i would put it in like. It's origin story of where trichoderma actually started comes from a single point of contact in the south pacific during world war two. Um, they had set up camp somewhere, like in the monsoon season in the south pacific, believe in the philippines, they had wax canvas tents everywhere. Like at that time that's what everyone was using. They had set up camp. Within three days, their wax canvas tents, which are extremely waterproof and just resistant to anything going on environmentally, started literally melting away, and it's because they had come into contact with some trichoderma fungi. That was collected as a sample, brought back to labs and then a lot of work has been done with it since then. It's used in a lot of industrial processes that, like, never really get mentioned. It's used in stone washing jeans- trying to think of something else it's used in- but in gardening they found out that it is able to really, really, really quickly break down those organic nutrients that you'd be putting into your soil so that they are able to get to a plant available form much faster. And yeah, i mean it also is very competitive with other fun guys that are around and is able to outcompete most of the pathogenic ones that it's going to come into contact with. And so there are different strains of it. Just kind of looking at recharge, it's a let's see what do you got. You got trichoderma resea.\",\n",

They'll say: pure states are vectors in hilbert space with length one. Now that's something that many textbooks do. I encourage you not to think this way. Because i encourage you not to think this way because in reality in quantum computation we will encounter generically and universally density matrices. We will encounter so-called mixed states, non-pure states. These appear most generally in quantum systems because every quantum system is under the influence of noise, and when you have noise acting on a quantum system, then that takes a system in a pure state to a mixed state. I don't expect you to understand that statement, but i will have it said that i'll just say it. Quantum systems in the presence of fluctuations and noise from the environment generically are not in pure states, and so that's why we should just rip the bandaid off quickly and define states, as we do in simplified quantum mechanics, to be matrices, and then pure states are just a special kind. There's one further example of a state that you should definitely know, and that is if you have a probability distribution, and this is how you can take your knowledge about probability theory and upgrade it to a knowledge about quantum mechanics. If you have a probability distribution on a sample space of d things- d items- then what's a probability distribution on a sample space of d items? Well, it's a list of numbers, right? It's p1,, the probability that i get, item 1, probability 2, and so on, all the way up to probability d. and these probabilities, in order to be a probability distribution, you should be able to sum them up and get 1,, otherwise it's not a probability distribution.\",\n",

He is just trying to see how the system is surviving, what he is telling us. Now just look into this diagram. Only things will be very clear with that. So there are some mechanisms. Let us talk about society, guys. So let us talk about society and let us explain how society is surviving. And society is a system, yes or no? Do you have any confusion whether society is a system or not. Society is having plurality of individual actors. They are interacting. So there is a common goal, motivation and all those things, and everything boundary, and everything is there. So society is actually a system. So there are mechanisms. Mechanisms could be anything. It could be legal system, it could be political system, it could be economic system. There are different mechanisms. So these mechanisms, what is their role? They fulfill certain needs. That means they have certain role to perform and they perform that role and they fulfill that role. That means they fulfill the needs. And once they perform their duty, what will happen? It will bring society in an equilibrium. So we all will live in a very good system, in an equilibrium system. Now what will happen is, after some time, some disturbance can come.

And so what you need to do as a working quantum computer theorist is build up a dictionary of commonly applied preparations and measurements. So this is vital, in fact i better say that right now. So there are a list of really commonly applied preparations and measurements that people use in practice. Now i'll write out a couple of them. Basically we're going to learn them sort of on the job as we go by in these lectures, and i won't really take so much time to give you the full, comprehensive list, because once you understand the general shape of one of these commonly applied preparations and measurements, you'll no longer really you won't bother to remember this as a dictionary. You'll actually learn that postulate five helps you to remember this list of commonly applied preparations and measurements. So here's the vital list. I'll give it to you now. There's the so-called x preparation, where rho is given by a half, a half, a half, a half. There's the y preparation, where- i don't even think i can remember it correctly- i believe it's a half. Sigma y would be plus one. So i believe it's minus a half i, a half i. And then there's the z preparation, where rho equals one zero, zero, zero. You just have to remember these. As you learn more quantum mechanics and you get more experience with it, it gets easier and easier somehow to know which preparation is being talked about at which time. And then here comes the detections or measurements. There's a corresponding to each one of these preparations. There's a measurement operator. Just so it turns out they're the same thing.

Tip number six: video conferencing technology is critical because, as i said before, video is the most information rich form of communication that you can have inside of your remote team. So what i suggest you do is, if your budget is quite low, get on skype. Skype is free if you have a little bit more of a budget. Zoom is more expensive, but much better as a tool to be able to work and collaborate through video with co-workers that are remote. And even if you want to get started very quickly and easily, something like google apps will have a google hangouts feature inside of google apps that you can use like a zoom or a skype. So any of those three options are absolutely fantastic if you're looking at increasing your video communication or you haven't made that decision yet and you really want to actually deploy one of these tools inside of your organization. Tip number nine: what you need to do is set up a meeting rhythm. What doesn't get measured doesn't get managed, and if you're not meeting with people on a set time to a set rhythm, then people can get very distracted and they're not focused on executing on their work. So what i would suggest that you do is you either set up a daily meeting with people, a weekly meeting with people or a bi-weekly meeting with people. I think that you should not be meeting with people less than once a week. If you end up meeting with people monthly, you just won't get anything done and they may go in a completely separate direction that you didn't really intend them to go in.\",\n",

The rotor bars could break, could crack and fail, the bearings might fail, the rotor may be out of balance, the rotor might rub against the stator. I mean, there's lots of different ways it can fail and the consequences of failure and the likelihood of detection could be quite different. The likelihood of it failing because of a bearing fault has a certain probability of occurring. The probability of the rotor rubbing against the stator might be far less likely. If i was going to perform failure modes, effects and criticality analysis, i would look at every possible way the equipment could fail and look at the likelihood of each one of those failures and the likelihood of detecting each one of those failures, which is terrific. But that is a very time-consuming process and if we want to get something happening more quickly, then we step way back and we look at the motor as a whole and say in general terms what sorts of failures are most likely to occur, what ones do i really need to think about and what are the consequences of failure and what is the likelihood of detecting that. And that just lets us say what sort of risks are we facing. If we determine that certain assets pose severe risks, then we can look at them in much greater detail and go through failure mode by failure mode. So i'm rushing through this a little bit because there's a lot we can discuss. But if we can start with a basic criticality analysis, it lets us do a lot more.

Either one is acceptable. It depends on which component of the phrase you want to focus on. You like the object or you like the action of doing these things. Method three: split the sentence from a reader's perspective. In scientific manuscripts often we see sentences that are five or six lines long and as much punctuation as you use, as many commas as you can use. That often makes reading extremely difficult, even for the smartest and most well-educated and immersed scientists and reviewers. So splitting the sentence really just makes it shorter and easier to digest. The coach advised that i should eat healthily, exercise regularly and that joining a gym would make this easier. So let's make it a second sentence here. The coach advised that i should eat healthily and exercise regularly, period. He also told me that joining a gym would make this working out easier. You are adding a couple words, but it's much easier to read and you can add another element of meaning if you have a second sentence.

But in a case like this, where it highly depends on the initial value, there's actually another input to the flip-flop called reset. A reset signal is used simply to set the flip-flop to a known value. Typically, all the flip-flops in your design will be connected at the same reset line so that when it is reset, your entire design will enter a known state. Now this is a good example of just a digital circuit in general. But a more general description is a series of combinational logic blocks separated by flip-flops. Now you can have more complicated structures where you have the branching and different things like that, and you can even have feedback from one stage back into the combinational logic and all kinds of things like that. But the key takeaway point here is that digital circuits fundamentally are blocks of combinational logic separated by flip-flops or some other memory element. I hope this video has given you a basic understanding of digital logic circuits. Make sure to head over to embeddedmicrocom for lots of tutorials. I'll put links in the description.

But as long as i am very close to scale and everything is proportionally correct, it's going to look right and it's going to look natural on the layout. Another thing that is important to know is that when you're looking at a scale photo, even one that's head-on of the building, know that if portions of the building are a little closer than other portions, if other portions are farther away, the closer portions are going to be a little bit larger in scale on your photo than those that are farther away. Naturally, something that's farther away looks smaller. In this building, as you see, you've got this tower that sticks out in front of the front part of the building and so that's naturally going to be a little larger in scale. I've got the main front of the building where these doors are. That's where i've measured and taken my reference measurements. But you also have these recessed areas that are recessed in by 8 feet back into the building here and here and those portions of the building are going to look a little smaller on my scale picture here, and so i've got to be able to adjust for those things. Also, the farther you go out from the center of the photo, the smaller things are going to look.

So what we want to do is basically generate a bunch of different design solutions, evaluate them based on their performance and then use the principles of evolution to optimize them and generate new solutions. And to imitate this process of evolution, a few different genetic algorithms have been developed in the past couple of decades. The ones that we use today work quite similarly. So a population is generated, then for each individual the fitness is calculated and then we use the evolutionary operators of selection, crossover and mutation to create a new generation. And what a genetic algorithm is supposed to do is preserve previously found good solutions- that is a principle called elitism- and progress to the true pareto front as fast as possible, which is the convergence rate, as well as- and this is especially important in design- provide a diverse set of solutions to the human decision maker, so that the final solution can be selected by the human designer. And this is especially important in design because we are most of the time dealing with multi objective optimization problems. That means we have multiple, often contradicting, design goals or objectives. So how, in this case, how can we determine if one solution is better than another? And this is where the concept of non domination comes in, that says a one solution is better than the other if it is equal, or if it scores equal or higher in all of the objectives but better in at least one of them. So if we look at this sketch here, we can see that we have two objectives, f1 and f2, and we want that, we want to minimize.',\n",

Okay, you can put them together, you can separate them, create a space in between them. You can take one off, you can take the other off, so there's some versatility there. Okay, two clamps. And now what's neat about this thing here is it's: let me take that one off, i'm gonna take this one off too, and it's got a t-slot there. He's got his name on everything.

So that's good, that's our, that's our depth. That we're going, we're going to conventional mill, means cutter goes in this direction and spins as usual.

Now, of course, the real estate commissioner has that rule, and the reason that the real estate commissioner has that rule is if he sends out someone to audit a broker, he doesn't want to have to go to 55 branch offices to do the audit. We want to come to one location, the broker's main office- and figure everything out in the main office. So the licenses of any salespeople that are working for the broker must be on file at the broker's main office, not at the branch office that the salesperson works at. Now if you look here on page number six, you'll see something that says the broker-salesperson relationship and what's interesting about this is it's kind of unique in our real estate world as opposed to other industries. I'll give you an example in real estate, and you might want to make a little note of this here on page number six: in real estate, for tax purposes, we're an independent contractor, meaning that we get a 1099 form, not a w-2. So that's why most employees frankly kind of like tax time, because you know, february, march, you send out your tax return, you get a tax refund. A lot of the time real estate agents actually aren't paying into the system over the prior tax year. So a lot of real estate agents actually hate tax time. So that's a little hint that i'd actually give you: make sure that you're stacking some money away. Work with your cpa, figure out how much money you actually need to set aside so you're not caught off guard in april.\",\n",

What is the relationship between the two? What is the percentage? An example question could even be something as simple as what is the religious breakdown of the united states? Or how often do farmers go to the market to sell produce, if the road is paved or if it's unpaved? Or does public transportation actually solve transportation issues within a city? These are all things that would look at statistic and numbers to be able to answer these questions, where qualitative is more of an exploratory form of research and it's not necessarily defining and trying to prove or disprove a hypothesis. When it comes to collecting data, qualitative is normally going to use one source to collect data from. Maybe it's newspapers, journals, it might be observations or interviews or even audio and video materials.

Right, because some of those policies and mechanisms and the sort of ideas that we've come up for- scheduling and different layers of abstraction- are actually pretty useful in other contexts, right? So this is something that you can take out and apply to other types of problems, right? And then, finally, we're going to look at operating systems as kind of this historical progression. Right, we'll talk a little bit about why certain types of abstractions emerged. We'll talk about how they change over time.

I just go in the source control tab and i click this button here and i initialize my repo, i can do my first commit. Step number 2, validate, validate, validate. When your validation pass, then you commit and you validate. Often to validate. Today i will use azure cli. You could be using azure powershell also, if you like. The command to validate is azuregroupdeploymentvalidate and you pass a resource group. If you don't have one, it's time to create one. You could use azgroupcreate and then you pass the name and the location of your user group. Then for the validation, we pass the template file and the parameter file. We hit enter, take just a few seconds. When we get a long script like that, it's the arm template, populated with every real resource name, that will be used. Resource id means it's good. If it was an error it would have been super short, perfect. Step number 3. Nobody likes an arm template with 51 parameters. Step 3, reduce the number of parameters as much as possible. We cannot just delete them, of course. We need to move them to the variables and then play from there. The way i do that is i go back in the parameter files and i bubble up every parameter that i want to keep, for in this sample i will keep only four.

Which means the top of the hill has to be higher than 400, but it's not going to be as high as what the next line would be. So the next line, if there was one, would be 420. So the top of this hill is somewhere between 401 and 419 meters, or whatever unit it is. So, again, it can't be 400 and it can't be 420. It's got to be in between. How about on this map? Well, again, we're counting by 20s. So if this top line is 600, it means the top of the hill has to be somewhere above that, but lower than what the next line would be. So it's got to be somewhere between 601 and 619.. So rule number four says the highest possible elevation of a hill is just below the value of whatever the next contour line would be if there was a next contour line. So let's figure out what the height of these hills. Okay, so let's start with this one over here. So this contour line is 300. So let's figure out what we're counting by. So here's 200, here's 300.

Schrodinger, let's do the probability of a click now. Well, that's trace of. Well, i told you that the preparation in the schrodinger picture, the way dynamics works, or evolutions or allowed evolutions, work in quantum mechanics is that you have to change your preparation. So the new preparation is u prime and that's given by u rho, u, dagger, times by f. so the probability that you get a click for this experiment is given by trace of u rho, u, dagger, f. that's if you do things in the heisenberg picture and then the picture that you have in mind is that really you're like you know, i'm just thinking about the preparation and the dynamics is just being another preparation: u prime, rho prime. So i effectively like incorporate the dynamics of the apparatus into the preparation. That's one way of thinking in the schrodinger picture. But in the heisenberg picture you think differently.

So a polar covalent bond has two atoms bonded together with a significant difference in electronegativity between them, uh, which basically means that the electrons, although they are being shared between the two atoms, they're being shared unequally.

So what would be your criteria of success that would support your move to the cloud? And this measure has to be a defined, concise, observable outcome for your company. Typical things might include an increase in revenue and profit or a cost reduction, or maybe something more business-oriented like having a global access and reaching new markets. But it is important that this measure can be calculated and can be observed so that you can define it and track it. In this process, you will want to meet with your business leaders from the finance, it, infrastructure and application groups. When we know what to measure and why, do we move to the cloud. Next thing is business justification. During this step, we need to understand what is my return of investment, because your company is there to make money and it is important to track it, and this is what this step is all about.

But if you look right, on the rim of every little leaflet here is this beautiful pink outline. I have no idea what function it serves, but it is certainly one of the most stunning of all the aeroids. So here we see one of the most charismatic of all the aeroid leaves, the so-called swiss cheese plant. Because of these holes- and this is a phenomenon called fenestration. And again, like we saw with the dissected leaves, this is all about surface area. By producing leaves with holes in them, they don't have to produce a solid surface. Instead, they can stretch out their photosynthetic surface over a much greater area and take advantage of what light's available in the canopy. It is also possible that dissected leaves like these can help the plant regulate temperature. This is especially important up in the canopy when exposed to high light conditions. All of that extra surface area may help these plants shed heat a lot more efficiently. The majority of my collections have been made in neotropical areas. The richest area? Unquestionably, is the chocoan refugium this area.\",\n",

Storming can also occur when members start to challenge your authority as a leader. You need to be very clear about your vision for the team. First, reinforce roles and responsibilities and goals for the team. If there's any lack of clarity on the nature of the relationships between the team members, that can cause frustration amongst the team members and can cause problems. That is a typical aspect of the storming stage and you may find that team members in the storming phase disagree not only with your leadership but also with the overall goals of the team. They may question the value of the team's goals, which can then undermine the team's progress. They may become hesitant to take assignments. This is also when members can start to experience some stress again because of the conflicts with other team members. If your team is in the storming stage again, clarity is paramount: clarity about goals, clarity about roles and clarity about responsibilities. Talk to the team members about the four stages of team development and let them know that you feel like they're in the storming stage. Talk about what you would like to see done to move forward and to get past it. Consider doing additional reading on tuckman's four stages of team development on your own, especially if you're in the storming stage. The other comment that i'd make about the storming stage is this: it can last for a long time and the best way to shorten the time in the storming stage is clarity. It's to be clear about goals, roles and responsibilities. Now we've done forming and storming. Now we're on to norming. This is a phase that teams tend to move into fairly gradually.\",\n",

These are often written like fractions, with the top number representing how many beats will lie within a bar and the bottom number determining the length of note to count. The most common time signature is 4-4.. This means we count four beats in a bar and the lengths of notes within this bar must add up to the equivalent of four quarter notes. Granted, we can use any combination of notes and any combination of rests to fill up this space, as long as they add up to the equivalent of four quarter notes. Sound confusing? That's because it is. If we were in the time signature 3-4,, we would count three beats in a bar that are the length of three quarter notes. But if we were to double both of these numbers and use 6-8, that's actually different than 3-4, because, remember, we're musicians and not mathematicians. If any of this went over your head. Just use 4-4.. frequencies. This is a note. A note is comprised of a pitch and a duration. Pitch is the particular frequency of a sound, measured in hertz. This determines how high or low a note is. Someone, somewhere, then decided to assign arbitrary names to pleasant-sounding frequency values as the first seven letters of the alphabet. Any frequency value that is, an exact multiple of one of these notes is also considered the same pitch, just played either slower or faster. For example, 440 hertz corresponds to the note a, but so does 880 hertz. Since this is the same pitch, just played twice as fast. The gap between these two notes is called an octave. So to distinguish between these two notes, we often call them by their letter name and octave number.\",\n",

I think let's see what else working in the round is a little bit differently. So when you're making a hat or anything, that you're starting in the center and then working your way out is going to be different than just going through and going back and forth on rows if you're making, say, a blanket. So you'll have a little bit different how you're starting each row, i guess. So, working in the round, mine says this pattern is worked in rounds. Each round is joined with a slip stitch into the first stitch from the beginning of that round, not the chain. So at the beginning of each round in this pattern what i do is i chain 2.. lots of people chain 3 with double crocheting, but i have found that it looks like there's a gap there and you can kind of see a hole and i just don't like the look of it. It just for me, my personal taste, i don't want it to stand out. So chaining 2 seems to help with that for me. So at the beginning of each row i'll be chaining 2 and then i actually do my first stitch into that first stitch that you're in when you chain, if that makes sense. So i chain 2 and then i double crochet right at the bottom of that stitch and then i go all the way around and then at the end of the row or the round, i guess i slip stitch to the top of that first stitch that i had made from that round. So another thing to think about is there's going to be different sections.\",\n",

You can find them in the description below. But this video is about qualitative and quantitative research. Now, they're both pretty similar yet very different, and it's important to understand the differences between them. Qualitative research is going to be focusing on things that are up for discussion and for debate. It's going to be describing a lot of things. It will use surveys and observations and interviews, along with also looking at artifacts of an area. It'll look at language. It's going to look at religion and ethnicity. It's going to look at these things from a manner that is up for discussion, where quantitative is going to be trying to definitively prove something. If a geographer, for example, is looking at an area. It's going to look at the economic data, the political description. It's going to look at population breakdowns through age and gender, or even looking also at things that are just concrete. These are things that are facts. You can't dispute them. They're not up for debate. When it comes actually to the research part, qualitative is going to be asking more questions that deal with what and how. They're going to be asking for more open-ended questions. For example, how do people living in inner city view their country? Or how do ap students celebrate finishing the ap human geography test? These questions aren't necessarily going to have a hypothesis, because we're not trying to predict anything here. We're trying to gauge and understand better the society around us.\",\n",

You could really spend an afternoon just on a couple pages and just learn a ton of information, because the information is concisely presented, yet it's very highly informational. The atlas of archaeology also has artifacts and site layouts, how different sites were. So, for instance, ancient ur in southern iraq, for instance. You know it lays out how these sites were closer to home. In the united states i have the dk, smithsonian, american revolution, visual history. So in addition to maps and artifacts, it's also going to have all the paintings and a lot of the documents and you have that in one bound volume. And that's just what's so handy about these books and again, i wish i could just open it and show you. I just don't want to violate copyright rules, but these really are treasures, these atlases. Another book that i like is the atlas of world archaeology. It's edited by paul bond and it's very similar to past worlds in that you open the book and there'll be a two page full spread of a map and both past worlds and atlas of world archaeology essentially go chronologically, so at the beginning of the book starts in prehistory and then it moves chronologically through world history.

So if you're not getting the building, you're not actually going to get a deed, you're going to get something called a bill of sale. So one thing that i would put in your notes, next to business opportunities, is transferred using a bill of sale. If it were real estate, it would be transferred using a deed, which we'll learn about in a later chapter. So personal property is transferred using a bill of sale, whereas real estate is transferred using a deed. Now, because these business opportunities don't involve the sale of real estate, you're actually not going to get a deed again, you're going to get a bill of sale. Now you might say to yourself: well, wait, what if i'm actually buying a business that also owns the building? Great, well, you'd get a bill of sale for the business, you'd get a deed to the building, and each one of those would be valued on its own merits. So again, business opportunity transactions, not real estate. They're personal property and they're transferred using a bill of sale, not a deed. Now your question might be: well, if this doesn't involve the sale of real estate, why the hell do i need a real estate license in order to do it?

If you're only really playing the scrum master role- for example, you're not a developer- well, you still have some very important points to work with. When it comes to the product-related activities, right, it might be related to the product quality, through the definition of done and encouraging the team to improve it. It might be through the spirit of experimentation, making sure that the team understands how to better conduct the experiments and anything that can be there.

You can make the same wish again, as long as it has sincere meaning for you, or you can change the wish occasionally. May i be happy. May my whole body be completely relaxed. Now, when you're sitting, your mind is going to wander and think about other things. As soon as you notice mind is thinking about other things, simply let go of those thoughts, even if you're in mid-sentence. Just let it go and relax, smile and come back to this feeling of loving-kindness.\",\n",

Die kühe werden morgens, wenn es noch dunkel ist, so um 6 uhr, in diesen raum geführt, und da werden sie gemolken, und während die zum melken vorbereitet werden, legen wir auf unseren tisch eine frischhaltefolie. Gemolken werden die kühe auch nicht mit der hand wie früher, sondern mit einer maschine. Dazu werden die zitzen erst sauber gemacht, dann kommen solche saugnäpfe auf die zitzen, der automatische melkmann, dann wird die maschine eingeschaltet, und die saugt dann aus dem euter die milch ab. Die anderen kühe warten, wann sie denn endlich dran sind. Die milch läuft dann über diesen schlauch in diese kiste, und während die kühe gemolken werden, legen wir auf unsere glasichtfolie eine alufolie.

These are great durability features for a long lasting house that will be there forever, that you can leave to your children and grandchildren. Concrete is a common material, pretty much. You can find it anywhere. There are some issues with architectural concrete and labor we'll talk about in the cons, but it is generally common material. Concrete is good for high risk areas. I built my first concrete house in the flood zone in new york after sandy. A lot of houses were destroyed and we were looking for new ways to build houses in the flood zone to withstand floods and hurricanes. We built several houses out of concrete and a few houses out of some other materials as well. That's how we got started. Concrete is great for flood zones, great for hurricanes, great for extreme conditions, but it also can be built anywhere. You don't have to be in a high risk area to build with concrete. The cons, the negatives in concrete house design. We also have to discuss aesthetics. Some people hate the look of exposed concrete. They think it's too rough or something. It is a more industrial look. It is a more incredibly modern look. That'll be up to your individual taste. The biggest downfall on concrete construction is the cost. It is more expensive. A normal house in the united states is built out of wood frame- what we call stick built construction. Concrete houses will be more expensive than a stick built house. Stick built houses- wood framing construction- was designed in order to be affordable. It is not used because it's a great construction system. It is used because it is affordable. Concrete is much higher quality construction, but it is also going to bring a much higher price tag with it. That is a major concern when building a concrete house. Next, availability of labor.\",\n",

Now, third, is model development. From linear regression to xgboost, from tensorflow to pytorch, the model development stage is where machine learning starts to provide new ways of unlocking value from your data. Experimentation is a strong theme here, with data scientists looking to accelerate iteration speed between models without worrying about infrastructure overhead or context switching between tools for analysis and tools for productizing models with mlops. Now, to solve these challenges once again as a jupyter-based, fully managed, scalable and enterprise-ready environment, you've got vertex ai workbench, which makes it easy as the one-stop shop for data scientists, combining analytics and machine learning, including vertex ai services. Apache, spark, xgboost, tensorflow and pytorch are just some of the frameworks that it supports in vertex ai workbench. Now, vertex ai workbench makes managing the underlying compute infrastructure needed for model training easy, with the ability to scale vertically and horizontally, and with idle timeouts and auto-shutdown capabilities to reduce unnecessary costs while training the models. Now notebooks themselves can be used for distributed training and hyperparameter optimizations, and they include git integrations for version control. Due to the significant reduction in context switching required, data scientists can build and train models five times faster using vertex ai workbench than when using traditional notebooks. With vertex ai, custom models can be trained and deployed using containers for low-cost model development.\",\n",

I did try bending it with just my fingers, but it was absolutely impossible, so i moved on to using tools. The first thing that i tried was to push on it with a steel spike, and i was kind of able to stab it in with a hammer, though i was able to smash it all the way through, and when i took it out, i had this nice little hole in it. The next test was to smash it with a hammer and see if it would flatten. Gold is definitely malleable enough to do it with the right tools, but doing it like this just isn't going to work very well. The only result that i really got was a bunch of hammer marks in it, and it didn't get much flatter. Now the last test was to see if i could cut it with a pair of pliers. With some soft metals, this is easy to do, but the gold was relatively tough. I was able to pull some very small pieces off, but that was about it. I did find it funny, though, because even though these pieces were really small, it was still something like 10-20 dollars worth of gold. From these few tests, i saw that the gold was definitely malleable, but it wasn't nearly as much as i thought. It's still enough, though, that making something out of pure gold might not be the best idea. With jewelry, things like rings and chains would definitely deform over time and potentially break. This problem is fixed, though, by mixing it with other metals like copper, silver or iron, which greatly increase its durability. But anyway, the piece now was all mangled and i just couldn't leave it like that.\",\n",

I developed this on a large chart in my classroom. Notice that it says monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday and in this particular one there's an assignment due on friday. What i do is when i'm making up my lesson plan, i create this graphic organizer and i list any of the big ideas, concepts or key vocabulary words as i build this for monday. Now, this helps me focus on what i will be teaching and reviewing every day so that i continually build on this information across the week, engage the students in collaborative conversations and discussions using these big ideas, and it also supports spelling when i ask them to write in response to text read or discussions in class. And so monday i would have my whole group lesson at the beginning, if you will- that introduction, framing of the puzzle, and then i would quickly complete this monday, the bubble of monday, on this graphic organizer and have them quickly talk with a partner and slightly review, just two or three minutes, what the big ideas were based on my graphic organizer. Then on tuesday, i would review monday and then i would do the same thing: have my whole class lesson. I would complete the graphic organizer for tuesday. Same thing would happen on wednesday: i would slightly review monday, more review on tuesday. So now what i'm doing is providing that repeated practice and that opportunity for students to engage in collaborative discussions using a structure or a text or print concept, being the graphic organizer on the chart.\",\n",

Don't hesitate and remove them. It will help you a lot to have a clean arm template. Step 4, use a unique string, a suffix or a unique identifier to add to your deployment. Why? Because if you're trying to deploy the same vm over and over, you will get some problem because some names may already be used. A good way to do that is use a unique identifier and add it to your names or your resources. For example, you could add a suffix just like that, and that suffix is: use the function unique string that will build a hash based on the parameter you pass. Right now, what i'm using as a parameter are the resource group id and the location. By doing so, if you're deploying in another location, the hash will be also different. Now, for example, if i want to use that in the virtual machine name, what i want to do is i will create a new variable called vmname and i will concatenate the parameter virtual machine and the variable suffix. Now what i want to do is i want to change where, everywhere with parameter, a virtual name was used, and instead use the variable vmname, just like that. Of course, in this first one i don't want to change it, so we'll skip it and i will do the others. Now, you guessed it. Let's validate it passed before going to the next step.

So what is? You know what is the rightmost bottom list on the complete tree and the way? So in this case, that's eight. So i'm going to push that to eight, and then what i'm going to do here is: i am going to, i'm going to shuffle eight down and i what i'm going to switch? I'm going to bring eight down and i'm going to- purposely, you know- make the tree right again, because now that i moved eight down- and this is a min heap- eight is not the minimum element. So that cannot be the root, five is. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to look at my two children, i'm going to look at my two children and i'm going to swap with which element is the greatest element. So that way i bring up the greatest element. So now my greatest element is now the new root node and everything is fine. In this case of a min heap, five, the smallest number, has the most power, is the most powerful. So i'm going to swap with five and then, as you can see right here in my bottom, in this bottom, in this bottom picture, that that array is now fine. I have now removed that, i have now cut.

You have the settings here and the settings are the parameters that you use when you're going into the report. So if we make this half screen and we end up running this report, this will give us a good example of being able to see half the screen of the report and half the screen of these report definitions. So let's take a look, let's preview this report and make it half screen. The first thing is is when we go to run the report again, these are the report parameters. You can see here we're requesting the ledger to be entered and we're requesting the starting period, and that's what you see here: the ledger and the starting period. Now you can turn these off and pre-fill in the default ledger in this case, or you can ask it to request. Same thing goes for the starting period. If you wanted to, you could create a report that says: only show me profit and loss for 2018.. you could do that. You can make as many report definitions as you want and hard code in the periods. That's certainly possible- not practical, but definitely possible. So if we run this report, we'll just get this up on the screen here for may 31st, let's go back, actually, and let's run it for 12-2018.. There's a little bit better data there for us to see.

The racetrack shown here is a high-level diagram describing the five phases necessary to identify, structure, conduct and complete a score improvement program. While the projects are linear by definition, score supply chain improvement is never totally completed and it is best conceived as a continuous cycle of detailed improvement projects, while the scope and objectives of individual projects will change. The score framework provides a tailorable, standardized repository of performance metrics, processes and best practices to guide improvement teams. Score implementation begins with identifying the improvement motivation, forming a score improvement program, organization and delivery of score education. After that, it's time to set the scope. Included in these activities are documenting the business environment, defining the scope of the supply chain involvement in the improvement program, summarizing the business context for supply chain improvement, documenting and prioritizing the supply chain, collection of initial supply chain data and drafting the improvement program charter. This is followed by configuring the supply chain by focusing on mapping the current state of the supply chain through analyzing both metric and process performance. Important activities during this phase include score metric selection, detailed competitive requirements, benchmarking and gap analysis. This phase provides the basis for the project portfolio and benefits calculation used in the next phase. Once we complete the analysis section, we move to the optimization section. Here we focus on grouping performance gaps into projects, calculating a metric benefit for each project and prioritizing the projects into implementation waves. The result is a portfolio of operational defects contained within each project, as well as the opportunities and benefits. We're now ready for implementation and to implement with full confidence that we are implementing a program that will show a definite return on our investment. Activities in implementation center. On implementing a single project in the portfolio, score level 4 processes are developed per the project's requirements.\",\n",

Square, sigma, remember, is 1. the square of 1 is 1, so 2 times 1. so removing sigma, because it's 1 and anything multiplied with 1 is is the same entity. So how do i generate this, this normal or density or a bell curve? Let's assume that the underlying variable has a mean 0 and the standard deviation of 1 and x varies between minus 4 and 4. so the mean is 0 and the minimum value is minus 4. the maximum value is 4 and i would substitute these minus 4 to 4 values in this equation. This is the only thing that's changing. The x here is the only entity that is changing, and let's see if this could generate the standard normal curve. Let us do this in python. We'll use the matplotlib function, which you are already familiar with for the graphics numpy library, as well as the normpdf function in the scipy stats library. In this example i have used increments of 0.1. this will generate the standard normal curve that you hear about in statistics. The other commonly used statistical distribution is known as the student's t distribution. William seeley gossett specified the t distribution. In fact he published a paper in biometrica in 1908 and he published it under the pseudonym student.

It's a more conservative approach, but the key pieces to expand things even further are already there. Apple's ar implementation is deeply integrated into the os. Anyone with an iphone or an ipad can download an application that uses ar. They've also created the arkit framework and the usdz 3d format. These are the two key ingredients for developers and con-creators to deliver ar experiences and, of course, for years now, we've been hearing rumors about apple working on some sort of headset. Microsoft is a bit more aggressive in the ar space and it's already in a second-generation headset. Hololens has managed to showcase what can be done when the screen is not just a secondary display but a wearable device.

Google is also actively working on several ar and vr projects, and throughout the years, they've tried different approaches.

It's actually happening on a real quantum computer, this experiment, and you'll get clicks and no clicks and you could look at the empiric rate at which you get the clicks and no clicks and you should end up with about a half.

In this version of quantum mechanics we don't have dynamics, we just have measurements and preparations, and it turns out that's actually enough, right?

Now it's worth saying that we have these postulates and they tell you the mathematical rules for how to model these things, but they don't tell you how to model these things right.

The last one i want to mention here in this portion of the talk is numba, which is really great for speeding up code on a single worker. So imagine you have some code that's in numpy or some other mathematical code that you want to run. Numba is really good at speeding that up.\",\n",

The client's instructed to follow a recommended diet, usually a low fat diet. As an important component of the therapy, liver function tests and cholesterol and triglyceride level determinations will be performed periodically while they're taking this medication. And the client needs to be instructed to consult with the physician before taking any over-the-counter medications because of that potential for medication interactive effects to occur, and so it's really important to note the strategic words in the question: need for further teaching. This phrase indicates a negative event query and it asks you to select an option. That is an incorrect client statement. So recalling the action of this medication and using general guidelines related to medication administration will help to direct you to option three as the correct option. And then we have our next question on nitroglycerin. This one happens to be a select all that apply question, and so i don't believe we'll be able to use the polling feature with this. Do you have a poll? Oh, we do have a poll, excellent, nevermind disregard that you can poll with this question. So i'll go ahead and read it first and then we'll open the poll. A hospitalized client with coronary artery disease complains of substernal chest pain. After assessing the client's heart rate and blood pressure, the nurse administers 0.4 milligrams of nitroglycerin sublingually. After five minutes the client states: my chest still hurts. Which actions would the nurse take? Select all that apply. One: call a code blue. Two: contact the client's family. Three: assess the client's pain level. Four: check the client's blood pressure.\",\n",

So all of these resources- before i kind of dig into the weeds of all of them, they're all free and you can get online and research and really go down the rabbit hole with them as much as you want. Scikit-learn is great for traditional statistics and machine learning and some new computer vision, and it's a really well maintained toolkit in the python ecosystem. So i recommend looking at that. Tensorflow and pytorch are really great for getting into the weeds of deep learning. So if you have someone on your team that is really strong technically and can really dig into this, then these are where you're kind of going to go to be able to do custom models and optimizing models for a specific problem. But i really recommend, if you're getting started in this space, to look at fastai and google colab because, as i mentioned, all these tools are free. But fastai has a really great set of reference material and courses and forums that you can get on and ask questions, and the community is really really nice and i found them to be really helpful when trying to implement things. In google colab- although there's this pro version now that has been a bit controversial with some of the pricing- if you're doing the free work of just getting started, it's a great resource for that and so you can kind of have your own virtual machine and your own notebook that you can work on for free.\",\n",

It's not really a ballet dancer type movement. You're trying to let that knee go forward. But, like with the other one, if you find that you're, i'll show you this way. If you find that you're getting a little bit of knee pain as it goes forward, you can limit the knee initially and sit backwards with an aim for that to go further forward, because the further forward it goes, the more quads, patella, tendon strength you're going to get, the more loading capacity you're going to get on that knee. Better the quads, okay, more conditioning for that leg for the run. So try and make sure that over time, if you are letting that knee sort of hold back, you're getting it bending forward, which will actually get you dropping down further as well without having to tilt over again. Try and maintain. You know, have you got a neutral core? Don't need to let yourself round over when you do this and try and focus on that again. Like i said, eight to 10 reps, three sets.\",\n",

And then, tom- i don't know if you monitor this, but you know, yell at tom, just kidding, i'll probably review your prs if you contribute. So go ahead and contribute.

The most free-flowing kind of consonants are known as approximants. For these sounds air can make it up pretty easily from the lungs and out of the mouth, but it's not quite as smooth a ride as it is with vowels, where the air is super free. Now english has three regular approximants: rr, jj and ww. These sounds have very strong acoustic profiles. They're loud and easy to hear. J and ww are almost exactly the same as the vowels i and ɜ. just said really quickly, just hold a, j and c. but they behave basically like consonants for how languages treat them. You'll note that there are two other rows there as well for lateral fricatives and approximants. What's that lateral thing about? Well, usually air just flows right out through the middle of our mouths. But that's not the only way for it to go. You can also block up the middle of the mouth but curl down the sides of your tongue and let the air escape that way. That's why these sounds are known as laterals. They've got side flow. Just feel what you do with your tongue for ul in english, like in lucky sides down right. But if they don't go all the way down, you can get tight fricative-style flow around the sides of the tongue, like in the welsh word for the other, chach. Finally, maybe you've noticed that we've been pairing up sounds together on the chart, like ff and vv or ss and zz. That's because there's one other way in which sounds can differ.\",\n",

By claiming property over the fox, post was asserting not just he had a right to the fox but that pearson had a duty not to interfere with his activity, with his pursuit and his hunt. And how a court rules on a particular case like pearson versus post is not just important to pearson or even post. It in some ways sets up a rule that would be then applicable going forward in society, and whether or not that rule is accepted by society in general may determine whether or not that particular rule works and people turn to the legal system or people turn to extra-legal means, such as violence, in order to resolve their particular disputes. And in this case we also recognize the broader societal implications of property law, not just in determining the rights of the two individuals. Whether or not we have a society in which property is unevenly allocated may affect in some ways our understanding of democracy or the sense of justice or equity in a particular society. Whether a store owner who has a ownership of a particular store has the right to exclude someone on the basis of their race, for example, may not just define whether or not a particular individual may be harmed based on their race, but whether or not we have a society that is based on our understanding of racial categories and hierarchies. In other words, property is not just about the thing or about the individual who owns it. In some ways it's about the broader societal context in which the property rule then constructs through how it operates through the law. With that said, what we're going to do in this particular course is go through not only these questions but, through them, understand the basics of property law and its significance. We're going to look at what is property, what rights go along with property and how the court enforces them.\",\n",

We've got some muscles that are able to pull on the hair and to rise the hair, even so that sometimes, especially when you're cold, then you might be able to notice that some of the hair, especially on your hands, they start to stand up.

I think i need to answer now the question of how this is possible, that, even though the dna is the same, that the cells perform different functions. And the thing is the following: is that the cells, even though they have the same dna, not all of the dna is actually also used and what we biologists say expressed. The purpose of dna is to code for proteins. There are many, many different proteins in a human body, in human cells, and those proteins are the structures that actually do the tasks they actually do the work in a cell and how to make those proteins. This information is stored in the dna of the cells. However, not all of the dna is always needed and to give you an example, my skin cells. They contain, of course, also the dna how to digest food. Even though their responsibility is not to digest food, they still carry this dna. But this dna is not used, it's packaged away and it is not active, and different cells have different parts of the dna that are active and therefore the different cells are able to make different proteins and therefore they are able to do different tasks.\",\n",

I then can use the following syntax, which has a select statement and a from statement, so select is used to identify the column of interest that we want to grab, and from is used to identify the table we want to connect to. When i send this query to the database, it then will provide me back a list of all my subscribers. Now sql can be used in a lot more different ways. For example, we can actually use it to go in further and analyze the data, such in this case, where we can add on a where statement to filter our data further based on how many users commented more than 100 times. We can also use sql to insert or store more information in a database. For this, we can identify the table and columns we want to insert into and then provide the values to insert into this table. Once i run this, the table will be updated. And then, finally, we can use sql to update record entries. For this, let's say, we have a new comment on one of my videos. Once again, we can identify the table we want to update, the column we want to set a new value for, and then a where statement to select what to filter on for that entry. Once i run this, the table will be updated. So now we understand how to query a database and generally what a database is. But what database do you use? Well, stack overflow conducted a survey last year that asked respondents about what software tools they used for their job. When we look at the most popular database options, we can see that there are a plethora of options to choose from. To make things a little complicated, there's actually two types of databases on this survey. There are relational databases- so sql databases- and non-relational databases, or nosql databases.\",\n",

Once one has identified a problem, reviewed the literature and determined the purpose of the study, then one can begin to collect the data. The data are then analyzed and interpreted, the findings are reported on and the research is evaluated and we would be back in to increasing the body of knowledge into the particular research area. Now the process of research, of identifying the problem. You must specify a problem. You're going to have to justify that not only is there a perceived problem, but that the problem is worthy of study, and then you're going to suggest a need to study the problem for specific groups or specific audiences. A review of the literature is really quite complex. The books, journals and electronic resources among these journals are considered kind of the top end of that. The scholarly peer-reviewed journals and a lot of the electronic resources will have scholarly peer-reviewed journal materials available.

After independently processing or level balancing, the mid-side signal can be decoded back to left and right. Mid-side gives you a very different type of control during the mastering stage because new opportunities emerge. You could eq or compress wide-panned elements such as guitars or effect returns without affecting typically central panned elements such as the kick snare, bass or the lead vocal, for example. Listen carefully for mid-side trade-offs with experienced ears. When raising the mid-channel to increase the vocal, the stereo width narrows, and vice versa. Changing the width alters the mids. Mix engineers who rely largely on near-field monitors often produce stereo-compromised mixes because listening on near-fields is like having a big set of headphones, which exaggerates the stereo separation. Using mid-side to increase the width is initially attractive but can easily produce an unfocused, phasy or vague stereo image. Therefore, more than about one decibel of mid-side variation is usually a bad idea. The fletcher-munson curve. I'd like to quickly mention the fletcher-munson curve. As to apply effective equalization, it's critical that we understand this interesting phenomena of human hearing. The fletcher-munson effect dictates that high-frequency energy produces more loudness than low frequencies at the same sound pressure level. As the actual loudness changes, the perceived loudness our brains hear will change at a different rate depending on the frequency. For example, at low listening volumes, mid-range frequencies sound more prominent, while the low and high-frequency ranges seem to fall into the background. And at high listening volumes the opposite is true: the lows and highs sound more prominent, while the mid-range seems comparatively softer.\",\n",

Suchgen was, needless to say, pretty chuffed with them, although he did have to wait some 5 years while matisse repeatedly repainted the blue parts until he was happy. Suchgen later complained that while they did look great during the day, at night under his new electric lights the colour harmony was exceedingly different. Electric lights were not the only unexpected development of the time. Suchgen would, in a few short years after dance and music's commission, find himself exiled and his collection seized by the revolution that swept russia, which no doubt put the whole lighting situation into perspective. Matisse, back in france, would soon be confronted by a similarly historic event in the first world war. Matisse was by this time too old to fight, though he appears to have faced great anxiety because of the war. The front lines were not far from his childhood home and his elderly mother was in german controlled territory where he could not reach her. This anxiety is reflected in many of his works from the period leading up to and during the war, where that trademark matisse colour seems to drain from them and greys and blacks become more pronounced. The piano lesson is one of these works, showing matisse's son hard at work at his thankless task of piano practice, to which his father condemned him for two hours every morning. The most striking thing about this work is its austere, dominating grey. The areas of colour that are present seem to recede in power and become more abstract than ever before, barely even registering as objects at all, but rather as geometric intrusions.\",\n",

Now it all feels like a big ask at the beginning, but start with the five-minute rule. Go for a walk five minutes, commit to that. After five minutes you can ask yourself: is this helping? How am i feeling? Don't want to carry on, or actually is that enough for today? And you can learn coping skills that will help you do those things. And then you can also learn to challenge your thoughts. Change the way you think. Not just challenge, but learn not to believe everything your thoughts say. Learn to not pay attention to your thoughts all the time. Start to notice the positives, because when we're depressed we tend to focus on all the negatives, on the past. We ruminate and ruminate and get caught up in horrible things. But we can start to notice the ok stuff and the good stuff and you can learn skills again that will help you do this. So if you're thinking differently and acting differently. That's going to have an enormous impact on the way you feel.

When we look at the planning, in the pedagogy model the planning is done by the teacher with little input from the learner. In andragogy, you have collaborative planning, you have collaboration between the teacher and the learner in order to determine what should be studied, and the teacher becomes a facilitator rather than the great sage on the stage. In pedagogy, we won't look at the diagnosis of need and we won't examine it for andragogy. In pedagogy, the teacher determines what is to be learned and the teacher determines the level of learning that must occur. In other words, the teacher sets the level of mastery. In andragogy, need is diagnosed by mutual assessment and the teacher and the learner collaborate to determine what level of mastery is required. In pedagogy, the setting of objectives is done by the teacher again, and in andragogy, the teacher and the learner set objectives by mutual negotiation. You see the trend developing here: pedagogy is very much about the teacher. Andragogy is very much about the self-directed, independent learner who is motivated to learn. The designing of lesson plans: in pedagogy, the teacher just sets the content by the subject and the sequence is determined by the subject. In other words, the teacher says: this is what we're going to study and the subject dictates the sequence that is going to be utilized. In andragogy, you have such things as learning projects. Problem solving is key and it's sequenced by readiness to learn, in other words, what fits real life. How might we solve a real life problem and how then would it be structured? It is about involving the learner in the process of designing the learning plans. Learning activities differ substantially in pedagogy. Pedagogy is about transmittal of information.\",\n",

This molecule doesn't fragment in many other ways apart from those ones we've recognised here, and you will notice as well that you get the two halves of the peaks if it snaps in notice that our peak at 31 is quite abundant.

Now, just four years later, it appears that rather than urgently seeking similar orders under section 424 of the fair work act suspending the proposed industrial action management and the new south wales government opted to shut down the entire transport network. So shea's asking you to ask yourself now: why didn't they do the same thing again? If it was such a threat, why shut it down with no notice whatsoever and not take the action that you've already successfully taken years ago? If, as been claimed loudly by the media, the proposed protected industrial action posed such a threat to the safety of commuters on the sydney rail network that it necessitated shutting down the network entirely, why weren't these claims put to the test before the commission on sunday night in the urgent hearing listed at the request of sydney trains? So they literally had the same hearing on the night before and did not put those claims that were successful last time to the test? The rules, shea says, around protected industrial action under the fair work act are complex. In essence, the provisions allow for a level of industrial rough and tumble in the form of protected industrial action. For employees, this can span a range of conduct from refusing to wear work uniforms or overtime or other bans right through to a total refusal to work or a strike in the traditional sense. For management, this includes the right to respond to such action by employees through a lockout of their workers, in other words, closing all the doors and saying: you're not let in, we're not paying you. All of this takes place in the context of bargaining for a collective agreement to govern working conditions for up to four years, which is what they're in the middle of. The ability of workers to take this action is highly constrained.\",\n",

I was struggling with cutting out the corners of this banner and a good solution to deal with them was to drill out each corner with the dremel first and then connect the dots essentially with my x-acto knife. The edges were pretty jagged so i cleaned it up with a file. Brass shim stock is super thin so i can bend and curve the surface to my heart's content. It doesn't exactly look perfectly like cloth, but once it's painted it'll look great, and i'm sure i have some skills to learn about dealing with this new material as well. With that done and the holes drilled for the chains finished, i was able to thread the banner on and fasten it to the other side. At the moment the banner is all floppy and you can definitely keep it like that if you want, but i wanted to fasten it in place and i did that again with some super glue thin. Be sparing with this stuff, because it has a tendency to get everywhere, and i mean everywhere. All right, let's get even weirder. When this commission was sent to me, it was also sent with some bits from the forge fiend kit for conversions. I wanted to use the assault cannon looking thing, but it was a little dinky. So i grabbed some hollow styrene rods that were similar in diameter and glued them to the weapon, with a larger diameter rod running through the middle. I trued up the ends of these pipes with some gentle sanding once the glue was cured. Now the part that this thing would normally attach to has a gaping hole in it. So i busted out my trusty circle cutter and cut a little styrene disc that fit nicely into the hole.\",\n",

Maybe we could say: well, when you're prosopagnosic, maybe something's happening to the face recognition units or to this bit of the model, which would leave expression analysis and some of the other stuff intact. So maybe we can start to scrub out some of these boxes and produce a model for what's happening in a neuropsychological disorder like prosopagnosia. So another sort of interesting aspect of this, which i touched on before the break, is what we call covert recognition in prosopagnosia. So prosopagnosics can't recognize faces explicitly. If you ask them who is this person, they won't be able to tell you. But sometimes they show what we call covert recognition, which means that even though they can't produce the name, if you force them to guess, they actually do so better than chance. Or they might show semantic priming effects. Remember, we talked about semantic priming effects. So they might not be able to tell you that it's cheryl cole or david beckham or simon cowell, but they might still get faster if you show cheryl cole and then simon cowell. So remember, that was what semantic priming was. You can be cued by the semantic relationship between two faces. So even though they can't explicitly tell you who this person is, they might still show this kind of semantic priming effect. And if you ask them to try and learn faces which are famous, like you, give them some kind of learning task. It turns out that they can learn those faces better than faces which aren't famous. So there seems to be something residual which is still there, something which allows them to do that kind of recognition.\",\n",

What it indicates is that if somebody doesn't apply, they got 10 months. If they don't apply, then it's going to convert into a loan at that time. Now i'm piecing together some things from the past and we know that there's been updated guidelines upon updated guidelines. My understanding is that whatever amount is not forgiven, the interest is going to start accrue at the date that you got the money originally, the disbursement date. So it's not really a strategy to say, well, i'm not going to be able to get any of this forgiven, for whatever reason, so i might as well just wait the 10 months past the end of my covered period because at least i'm deferring interest. Well, you're not. What you're deferring maybe is the payments, but that interest is going to be all the way back to the beginning. Based on what i know, that's not in these guidelines, that's just based on what we've seen since the beginning of this, going all the way back to the end of march. On page nine, specifically talking about applying for forgiveness, you have 10 months from the last day of your covered period, which another way to look at that is that if you elected the eight week covered period, then it would be from the data disbursement, plus eight weeks plus 10 months is your deadline.\",\n",

It's a term that most lecturers hate as well, but, to be honest, we all have take-home messages. What is yours? Does your final slide have a final statement on it? Does it increase the understanding of the audience so we know what their level of understanding is. Does your talk increase that understanding or does it make it more confusing? And have you got any way during your talk to assess whether the audience have understood what you're saying? There's nothing wrong with presenting a talk and asking questions of your audience just to see if they understand what it is that you're talking about. And, of course, your argument needs to be structured. You need to start with a clear and concise introduction to your talk, explaining what the current level of knowledge is, explaining where we are in the literature. For instance, use a literature review that you've written for your project and explain to the audience where we currently are and then develop on those ideas by talking about the methodology that you're going to be talking about in your talk. Show the data, summarise your data and then give a list of recommendations of where either the field is going or what further research might be needed to fully answer the questions. It's very unlikely that a talk given at undergraduate or postgraduate level will be able to fulfil all of these arguments, simply because we don't have time often in the lab to be able to make recommendations for future research.

       "  'input_text': \"Don't assume you're being clear just because you've said the words. Here are some common obstacles to clarity. Addressing these issues will ensure you have the communication skills to be consistently and easily understood. Fast rate is one of the most common causes of unclear speech. Vowel sounds get shortened and words become a jumble of consonants. Slowing the speed of your speech gives you time to form sounds accurately and gives your listeners time to absorb what you've said. Learning to breathe deeply while speaking is one of the most effective strategies for slowing down. Naturally, mumbling often goes hand in hand with fast speech. When you speak quickly, your mouth doesn't have time to open very far, so speech sounds get distorted, being squeezed through your teeth. Practicing jaw and tongue relaxation creates more openness in your mouth and encourages more precision in the formation of vowels and consonants. A quiet voice often contributes to a lack of clarity. When you're not putting enough sound into the room, your listeners have nothing to work with. Using more breath, feeling sound vibrations in your body and inviting your voice to fill the room will generate more power without straining. Remember, your voice will seem louder to you than it sounds to your listeners. Get used to it. An accent can make it difficult for others to understand you, especially if it's combined with a quiet voice or fast speech. Learning to master a few strategically selected language skills can produce dramatic improvements in clarity. But before you invest in accent training, make sure you're speaking slowly and projecting well. In many cases, that's all that's required to get the clarity you need. Failure to speak clearly is not a minor inconvenience. It has serious implications for your personal image and your professional success. When people struggle to understand you, they eventually ignore you.\",\n",

So we can give a little bit of deference to the government here because essentially there's less constitutional value at stake. Okay, that's the big picture idea of kind of how the supreme court is determining what level of scrutiny or what standard of review to apply to determine the constitutionality of a law. But that's just a big picture concept. To really know exactly what standard of review we're applying, we have to go through all the step-by-step analytical frameworks that are laid out in all of our constitutional law lessons.

The best way to do this is just with examples.

So then, this statement that objects act differently when they're not being measured doesn't apply for everyday objects, which is why we didn't notice this rule for such a long time. But then scientists started to look at very small things like electrons. Things like air molecules and light aren't constantly hitting them because they're small enough to sort of fit in the gaps. So what exactly do objects like that do when no one is watching? Let's get back to the scenario where our object- so in this case our electron- is definitely in this spot or this spot, but we now know that nothing is measuring it. We expect that objects can only be in one place at a time. Even if you don't know where that place is, you know it's in one of the places, you just don't know which, and this is usually true. But in the case where nothing at all is measuring our object, like our electron, the following experiment will show us that this isn't true. The electron can't be at one place at a time while it's not being measured. This experiment is called the double slit experiment, and here's how it goes. We're going to fire electrons one at a time from here. When they get to this back wall, the place where the electron hits lights up. How do we make a wall that lights up on contact with electrons? The physics is a two step process. First, find one of those clever experimentalist people and two, ask them to use their experimental physics magic to help you. Simple, the point is: we know where the particle starts and somehow we measure where it ends, but in the middle we don't measure it and hopefully nothing else is measuring it either.

Microbes aren't going to be beneficial for me at all. Can you give us your thoughts on that? Is that true or not? Oh, first and foremost, definitely not true.

So, for those of you that are unaware, aws amplify is a way for front-end developers to get up to speed on aws. I think there's no shortage of folks with the understanding that aws has traditionally been super hard for a front-end developer to access, just because of the sheer amount of services that we offer- back-end tailored infrastructure and other tooling- but aws amplify is kind of here to solve that. So two new features that we have going on. The first one is going to be amplify. Studio is our graphical user interface that folks can use to drag and drop their applications. If you use netlify, vercel, et cetera to host your apps, very similar in that regard. The one added benefit, though, is that you can now design your files in figma. Take that link that you would typically share with your other designer friends and instead paste that into amplify and we will generate all of the react components for you. So it's a pixel-perfect one-to-one and it stays in sync, in the sense that if your designer were to modify the colors and the spacing et cetera, they press sync and then the developer can pull those down and it's all managed via amplify studio. Pretty cool. The thing that i think folks really like about that is the components. They're modifiable, they're human-readable, it's not that sort of long syntax of code that gets minified and unable to be read. But we take it a step further and we also now have a ga support for our ui components themselves.\",\n",

So the ions are attracted. Yeah, very nice, hallie, very good. Attracted, slash, accelerated, accelerated. Oops, i didn't mean to write that ions, i can't rub it out. I try to do accelerated, using a negative electric field. Opposites attract and therefore you get- oh, we'll come to that in a second- candy. Therefore you get an attraction if you get an attraction, but they're traveling at a high speed so they don't kind of veer off and stick to our negative plates. Oh, i forgot, i can't rub that out. They are attracted and they go through a gap where they're attracted to another plate, which they go past, which they're attracted to another plate they go past and eventually they speed up so much that you get separation occurring. So the separation occurs where the heavier molecules take longer to travel through a straight mass spectrometer. Or if you've got a curved one, then your heavier molecules will have a what they're called a larger parabola. They will be traveled on a larger curve and the lighter molecules will travel on a shorter curve and that's how you can therefore work out how big or small your molecules are. Or, like i said, if you've got a straight, what they're called flight path, then the lighter molecules will travel faster.\",\n",

See a lot of abstract shapes everywhere, but within all of this abstraction he introduces these more representational images. You can make out what this is supposed to be. So he's combining abstraction with representational or figurative elements. The style becomes more semi abstract, not entirely abstract or pure abstract. So back again to this page. I hope that those examples helps in gaining a better understanding of abstraction in illustration. I'll be showing more examples later, and it's very important that you see a lot of examples in which the illustrator creates this synthesis of abstraction and realism, of which mark english, as you saw, is a superb example. So what is abstraction? How can it be defined? As it pertains to picture making, it's about simplification, simplifying the forms and shapes in your pictures, and it's about painting shapes and forms that are not representational of any kind of subject matter and that don't have a story. But, as i showed you, in the paintings by mark english and richard powers, especially mark english, you can combine abstraction with more representational images and story, resulting in a more abstract-like style in illustration. Abstraction is also about the complete elimination of detail, or the reduction in the amount of detail. So you still have detail, but you are showing restraint in the amount of detail that you're putting into your picture. Thereby, you're simplifying the shapes and forms. It is about the forms and shapes becoming more important than the details, of which you see a superb example of in this painting by bernie fuchs. Through abstraction, you can attain simplicity in your paintings.\",\n",

As you learn more quantum mechanics and you get more experience with it, it gets easier and easier somehow to know which preparation is being talked about at which time. And then here comes the detections or measurements. There's a corresponding to each one of these preparations. There's a measurement operator. Just so it turns out they're the same thing. So that was pretty easy, right? So f equals rho. Here i'll call this rho x to make it clear that this has got something to do with these letters x, y and z. The y measurement f equals rho y and the z measurement f equals rho z. i want to stress that although f looks like it's also like a density operator, it doesn't have to have trace one. So this weird duality between these two things goes away very quickly. Okay, here's your list of basic preparations and measurements in quantum mechanics. You can go ahead and sort of do nine experiments this way. Right, you can try all forms of preparing and measuring to see what comes out. You can prepare your system in the x preparation and measure the y measurement and see what comes out. You can prepare in the z and measure the x and see what comes out. So you have nine kind of possible preparations and measurements. Now, as i said, in practice we often don't memorize these preparations and measurements. Instead we have two additional postulates which really help us in minimizing the surface area of stuff that we have to remember when we're trying to do quantum mechanics. And so now we come to postulate five, and this is one where there's going to be a little bit of physics creeping in. I'll try and keep the physics at bay so we don't get bogged down in too much physical discussion.\",\n",

Before i show you more about what bernie fuchs did, i want to show you these environmental concept art paintings that were done for the star wars movies, and i want to show you these because the artists here designed beautifully abstract shapes. You see all of this, these darks- here they're abstract shapes and here, of course, and here and even this, it's all more abstract, with very little detail that can be found within those abstract shapes. You can see some detail here, some tonal variations- lighter tone, darker tone- but the artist doesn't lose the essential simplicity of the overall dark abstract shapes. He would have lost that simplicity if he had added too many details and too many light tones that would break up that dark abstract shapes. He didn't do that and you see the same use of abstract shapes in this painting here. All of this is an abstract shape. Now, within this abstract shape, you can see some detail. Right here, you see, the artist added detail, but he didn't add the detail in such a way that it would break up the simple overall dark abstract shape. So, like i said, you can have detail within the abstract shape more or less, but the artist is keeping all of this detail under control. He didn't make the detail light in tone so that it stands out too much, so that it becomes too conspicuous. If he did that, he would have broken up the simple dark abstract shape.

Precedent is that prior decision of the same court or of a higher court which a judge must follow in deciding a subsequent case. So mary, her case, carved out that exception for self-defense. So now when sarah kills a goat, and she does so in self-defense, she can use mary's case and say: your honor in state versus mary, village versus mary. She was allowed to protect herself because she was being attacked by a goat and the judge looks at it and says: you're right, this is precedent.

Probably everybody in this room has been rejected at some point from a journal, so it's not something to be ashamed about or lose sleep over. But if we really want to get our work published in a scientific journal, then the question we have to ask is: why exactly are our manuscripts being rejected. So one answer that we have to this question is that there is a deficiency in the quality of writing in a great many of the manuscripts that are submitted. So there's thousands of manuscripts submitted to scientific journals and while the scientific research is in many ways novel, provides a contribution, has extreme quality of research, the quality of writing parameter sometimes is lacking.

We want to divide this today into two categories, and i'll be talking about manuscript content as well as writing and composition. When i talk about manuscript content issues, i mean consistency of material. Is the material consistent and logical in its exposition? Does the title match the actual topic that you're writing about? Is the abstract up to date with all the findings in the paper? When we discuss inclusion of appropriate content, it's self-explanatory, but do the introductions, the methods, results and discussion section include all of the necessary information? Do they include too much information? So we'll be looking at those. In the second part of my presentation we'll discuss writing and composition issues. This refers to using correct grammar and writing style. Effective writing style, since style affects the readability, the comprehension and engagement with readers of a particular journal.\",\n",

So relative atomic mass is the average mass of an atom, of an element, relative to one twelfth the mass of carbon 12, specifically carbon 12, because hopefully we do know that carbon have multiple isotopes, including carbon 13. So it's specifically the carbon 12 atom and it's one twelfth the mass of carbon 12.. because at this point, when we determined relative atomic mass, we weren't 100% sure about protons existing and because carbon is the most abundant element by mass, i believe, on earth and it's so important for us as carbon based life forms. We base it around carbon, but it's not actually a carbon atom. It's at one twelfth of the mass of a carbon atom, which happens to be the mass of a proton or a neutron, approximately isotope. Then is what? What is an isotope? Isotope? Oh, that's really nice, alyssa. Very good, brilliant, that's very succinct, very nice description. I'm not gonna have to write as much about it. I don't have very much space, but that's lovely, really good. So the key thing: iso, i believe means are different, so isotope- different structure, i think is a very basic entomology of the word. So it's the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Really nice. So we know it's an atom of an element. I know it's carbon, for example, because it's got six protons but it has a different number of neutrons.\",\n",

You could have had a bachelor's degree in anything and that would have counted as being equivalent for two years. Now that's changed. The real estate commissioner says: now one thing that has a lot of people kind of upset about this rule, frankly, is the fact that a lot of great schools like you might have gone to, let's say, stanford, or you might have gone to yale, or you might have gone to princeton- all great schools- but they might not have had a specific degree program for real estate. So that kind of has some people, you know, up in arms about this. But that's the rule now you've got to have two years full-time real estate experience with a major or minor in real estate. Now, if you're a lawyer, you actually don't need to take any of the classes. Your bar card gets you right in now. The commissioner does have something on the real estate website saying that they'd still like to see two years of law experience related to real estate. You can call our office if you want to talk about that more, but members of the california bar don't need to take any classes. Let's talk about education now. To get a broker's license, not only do you need that experience criteria, you'll also need eight college-level classes in real estate, and you'll see that list, of course, in your book. There are five that are required and then three electives, for a total of eight. That's how you qualify to take the broker's exam.\",\n",

Let me turn this into a black and white and you can see right here subtle tonal variations also here, here. But the overall shape is an abstract shape. The whole illustration is more abstract, just beautifully done. Now don't think that this is easy to do just because he's using these more simple, abstract shapes. This is difficult to do, to get it right. This is creative illustration, and creative illustration is more difficult to do than illustration in which the artist tries to replicate reality. Because if you're going to replicate reality, make the subject look the way it does in real life- there's no creativity involved. But here the artist needs to be creative, he or she. They need to think how are they going to change the trees, make them look different from the way they actually look, but still make them look like trees? Painting the trees or whatever subject it is requires on the part of the artist to be inventive and to invent shapes and forms that don't look like the object does in real life, but the subject or object still needs to be recognizable, like what pieck did here. Pieck had to be inventive. He had to think about how he is going to show these motorcycles and these riders. He needed to invent this style, these shapes, these forms, but they're based on reality. He didn't depart from reality entirely. If he did that, then the subject matter wouldn't be recognizable, it would just be pure abstraction.\",\n",

We're talking about how all these tough guys and fake tough guys and governments and militaries, the way that they spoke and the tough guy persona of the glory of warfare.

And german politicians did not want to bring britain into the war, but their armies marched into belgium and did just that. This was the exact opposite of clausewitz's concept that war is politics by other means, and it's an important aspect of understanding how the crisis ended in a world war. The war that started with the july crisis in 1914 lasted more than four years, but the war amongst historians, to make sense of it all, still rages more than a century later. The dramatic events that led to the first world war changed the world forever.\",\n",

And in fact, the pythagorean theorem, which you normally think about as being associated with right triangles- and if you didn't know that you will by the time you see the pythagorean theorem video. But now you know that it is the same thing as the unit circle, because it's a triangle embedded in a circle and therefore circles and triangles are intimately related. Now that should allow us to generate useful points on the circle. Why? Because we know that all the points on this circle satisfy: x squared plus y squared equals 1.. So let's clean this up and let's look at some of that. Alright, so here's pythagoras, here is the general equation for a circle and here is the unit circle. Now we're in a position to relate that during our arithmetic break, notice that we generated through that little break a bunch of equations exactly of this form. These are exactly of this form and if these have this form, then this must be a legitimate x and this must be a legitimate y on this circle. And therefore, this is an x, this is an x, this is an x, this is a y, this is a y and this is a y, because they all satisfy the unit circle relationship. And we figured out what these points were simply by doing some arithmetic during our little 1 plus 1 equals 2 break. So that is a way to generate points on the circle. So let's see what that looks like. Okay, so i'm just repeating over here what we had. These are some of our points that we generated in our arithmetic break.\",\n",

That's, of course, at the top half of 24. you'll also have maybe a couple of other questions on the exam about trust fund handling and i want to give you a couple of those right now. So the first thing i would note is- i would write the word at the margin on page 24: withdrawals from trust account. The question is: who could withdraw from the trust account? Now there's only three people that are permitted to withdraw from the trust account. By the way, the trust account has whose money? Client money. Now the client actually is not one of the people that could withdraw from the trust account because there's other clients monies in that same account. There's no law that requires segregated trust accounts. You could have one big fat trust account and just throw everybody's money in the same account and that would actually be legal. So clients cannot withdraw from the trust account. There's only three people that could withdraw. First, the broker can withdraw from the trust account and appointed salesperson could withdraw from the trust account. Now notice, i'm saying appointed salespeople, not all salespeople, not every salesperson just like randomly has access to the trust account. It's only those salespeople that are authorized by the broker. Also, an unlicensed employee of the broker could withdraw from the trust account, but only if that unlicensed employee is what bonded.

Their style begins to change because they begin to realize that a more abstract style like this, in which the principles of design are applied, is able to express mood in a much more powerful way than a more strictly realistic, more tight look. Now, peake didn't make this subject look realistic because he understood that reality in art is independent of literal visual scenes and objects. Art has its own truth and reason for being, and this is peake's truth of the subject that he is showing us. He has created a kind of new reality that is much more visually interesting and exciting to look at than real reality and thereby lets us see the subject in a new way, in a fresh way, in a way that we haven't seen before and that gives us an emotional experience. One of the great illustrations is all about mostly emotion. Sure, there's story involved, but it's the emotional form that should become more important, and emotional form isn't just about abstraction. It is adding all those other additional things of picture making, like i've been pointing out, like the principles of design and lighting, value patterns, animation and so on- all of the components of picture making, in addition to the abstraction, results in what is called emotional form, and there can be different degrees of abstraction, like ben stahl shows in his chart here that i showed you earlier in the video. You have to decide how abstract you want to make your subject. How powerful do you want the mood to be? If you focus only on story and neglect creating emotional form or creative form, as it's also called by ben stahl, then of course you end up with what i showed you earlier: just story without emotional form.

Another person that could make withdrawals from the trust account is a salesperson appointed by the broker. So a salesperson appointed by the broker can also make withdrawals from the trust account. An unlicensed person can also withdraw from the trust account as long as that unlicensed person is also covered by a bond. So in case that unlicensed person, like a company controller or accountant or cfo, if they steal the money there's no risk of harm to the public because the public is covered by the bond. So the bond, by the way, should be in the maximum amount foreseeable inside of that trust account. So if you've got two trust accounts and the unlicensed person has access to one of them and the bond- because they'll need a bond- is $500,000, if you get a million-dollar deposit to the trust account, this should not be in this account. It should be in another account that the unlicensed person does not have access to. So there's no risk of harm to the public because that unlicensed person doesn't have access to that trust account or raised the amount of the bond prior to the deposit. So again, just a review: client money goes where in a trust account? Who can make withdrawals from the trust account? Broker, salesperson, appointed or an unlicensed person, as long as they're covered by what that's right, covered by a bond. Does every broker need a trust account?

It's coming back strong and we had one right here too, but it started coming back in the beginning of the season but it just didn't last. So high hopes for that one that it stays. We've got this little pine tree. I forget what it's called, but that's where mj is. I got the little frog under here and it's doing really well. I was kind of nervous about it at first because it had a lot of the needles falling off. I don't know if it was just the time of the year or if a little bit of acclimation would die off and that sort of thing, but it's looking really good. It's growing a little bit. Glad to add it to the lineup here. I don't know. I think this one's like a bubble flower or something like that, a chinese bubble flower. Maybe it gets these cool white bubble looking flower on it which look pretty cool. I just added these two. I can't remember what they're called either, unfortunately. I told you guys i don't know everything, but this is a salvia as well. I tried to add those in as many places as i could. Like i said, got to really help out those pollinators, get them to have places around here. So it's pretty cool. It's giant, enormous lavender. I love it because it really naturalizes. The pond kind of hides, some of that hardware and it's spilling on over into everything which softens that edge. We've got a lily here and i planted some of these marigolds.\",\n",

But once you get familiar with the important parts of a pattern, you'll be able to look through it and find those pretty easily. So i put the size- i have my copyright up here. I have more sizes of the hat for purchase and then i have the gauge here that will show it. We'll talk a little bit about that, but this is very, very important and i'll be doing a video on how to figure that out here shortly, but essentially it's going to tell you if you're crocheting with the same hook and the same yarn that's called for in the pattern. The only difference will be how tightly each person crochets, which can vary drastically. So you want to make sure that you check that before you make the hat or whatever item it is, because if you don't, and then you end up making it, this hat could turn out like an adult size if you have really, really loose stitches and i may crochet way tighter. So that's very, very important that you check that, because i've seen lots of people on the internet talking about: i did this pattern and it's for this size and it turned out this size and a lot of times that's the problem. Or you're using a different hook size or a different weight of yarn or thickness of yarn, which i also have a video on. So another thing is going to be your materials, and then i have finished measurements just so you kind of have an idea to make sure that you're in the ballpark right size once you finish your hat. So we talked about materials, the hook size and what type of yarn you're using. Another thing is going to be abbreviations. This was probably the hardest thing.\",\n",

We know them, of course, as atoms. Okay, it was clear that there were little invisible things that were there, that were the roots of everything. Could it be that atoms were actually at the root of cells? People toss that idea around a lot and for a long time people felt that there has to be something different about cells. Maybe atoms exist, maybe molecules exist and maybe chemistry exists. But whatever exists, it has to be something different inside of a cell, because that's magic. As late as the early 1900s, people were saying: there's so much complexity inside of a cell we will never understand what makes an organism be alive. Never, say never. Okay, we will never understand what makes an organism be alive. Now, what may come as a bit of a shock to you is: it wasn't until about the 1930s that a man- excuse me that, a man named schrodinger came up with a very radical idea, and his radical idea was that all of the things that we see in biology have their roots in molecules. It was finally formally accepted. It had previously been shown that the chemistry that was going on inside of living organisms wasn't any different than what was going on outside of a cell. The chemistry was the same. The things that were made inside of a cell could be made in a test tube outside the cell. That wasn't a problem. But for the first time, schrodinger says there is the root of all living systems. It's not the cell, the root is in the molecules. Okay, that was the very first what i call what i call foundation of a discipline we call today molecular biology. You've all heard the term molecular biology.\",\n",

Grades three through five take home a work packet on thursday and middle school and high school follow a similar pattern.

See our comments, because often i'll make a comment when i'm reviewing that packet. Remember the students are going to organize the packet on friday but they don't go home until the earliest is the following tuesday. So i have several days to look at that packet and make a comment so that i am communicating with home and to the student about work that's happened at school. So differentiating teaching and practice has these simultaneously occurring activities. There's that teaching table, that small group, teacher-led instruction, and that's where you're going to introduce new content. You've introduced it as an overview in whole class but now it's in small group. So what you introduce in whole class that morning is exactly what you're going to teach explicitly in that small group and that's where we're going to use that on-grade level rigorous text and help students access meaning and then other groups of students will be in assigned small groups in collaborative practice. It is previously taught content, it's already gone through the teaching table, i've addressed the major questions and i don't grade that work because it's strictly purposed to enhance comprehension and i want dialogue so that they are developing their oral language about the topic under discussion.\",\n",

But looking at it very simplistically, we know there's a sender and a receiver. There's a message, right, the sender encodes the message, provides meaning to it. The receiver then decodes, trying to understand that particular message- we know that there are issues involved with that- and then, in turn, the receiver will send feedback to the sender where they can confirm whether or not they've understood that particular message. And that is how the communication process works.\",\n",

The second limb of dicey's theory on rule of law has also been criticized once again by sir ivor jennings. In the notion of all being equal before the law, jennings notes that, for instance, judges and ministers- when you consider the judiciary as well as the legislature and the executive- are immune from certain suits. Therefore, you cannot consider that every single person is equal under the law or before the law. Not all parties are equal and there are certain distinctions between groups of individuals in the state infrastructure itself. Thirdly, when you consider dicey's third limb- that rights are best protected under common law- we see that there is a criticism once again aimed at this third limb due to the uk being part of the european union and the enactment of the human rights act of 1998, bringing into direct effect the european convention of human rights. This being said, it is notable that the human rights act once again is repealable and it is important to note that, while this is not as harsh a criticism as that which is propounded by sir ivor jennings in relation to the first and second limb, it is nonetheless important to note in an examination situation. Rule of law is a vast and complicated topic and this was a very brief and succinct overview of it. I urge you to go through your primary sources of academic material, which is provided by your university, as well as various textbooks. You will find a list of books and sources to actually reference for rule of law, as well as every other topic discussed in this course later on in this particular program.

In the planning phase, there are again few steps that we need to follow. The first step is digital estate. This is so-called inventory of assets. You want to review what you currently have in your company and what you should do with it, and that decision, that rationalization, is so-called decided based on this five r's of rationalization rule. So for each digital asset that you will find in your company, you want to assign one r. first, we have rehost. Rehost means that we take existing application and we move it to the cloud without any changes. This typically means move existing applications into infrastructure as a service, so deploy this into virtual machine or a container. Another r is for refactor. So you want to make a small changes to your existing application code base in order to fit it into existing platform as a service offerings in azure. For example, if you have a web application running on a virtual machine and this web application uses sql server, maybe with a little bit changes in your code you can fit it to azure app service and azure sql to take advantage of the platform as a service offering in azure. Another option is called re-architect. For the re-architect you will need to make complex changes to your code base. This is used if you want to introduce new services in your application. For example, you might see that a key vault is very good service in azure and you want to introduce it in your application. Therefore, you might want to re-architect existing ones to take advantage of those security services in azure. But another reason for re-architecture is when your application strongly depends on the physical infrastructure in your company, so it is incompatible with the cloud.\",\n",

You know, four inch wide strips, which that's what you usually do for paper mache. It works out fine. Not so much for this, because you do sometimes get a little see, the edge gets a little bit like that or a little jagged where it gets torn, and that doesn't work because when you roll it those little jagged edges stick out. So the whole tearing didn't work, but i did find that it wasn't a big deal to just, you know, fold the page up like this and cut it and make the strips that way because it doesn't have to be perfect. So you take your magazine page or your newspaper page and, by the way, the sunday paper with all of the sales ads and the big colorful grocery ads.

As i mentioned, i'm already fluent in french and spanish, and busuu is definitely the best language learning app i've personally used. It has the depth of grammar lessons that i was really looking for, and it also has this brilliant feature where you can connect with natives in the language and kind of share learning with them so they can learn english through me and i can learn japanese through them. And even at the early stage i've been able to actually practice pronunciation and get feedback from real japanese people, which is pretty cool. But best of all, it allows me to practice sustainability. It's powerful ai technology. It does clever things to build a unique study plan just for you, and i found that that has really helped me stick to just 15 minutes a day. I have it set to remind me and i do it like four times a week, and that has allowed me to make real, genuine progress in the last couple of weeks, but also to be possible for me to do that and commit to doing it as i go into my busy life as a corporate lawyer. There's one core principle that we can take from the comparison of the intense german course and how i am now learning japanese, and that is that there is a fundamental psychological disconnect between what we consider to be the need to commit 100% to doing something in order to make progress and, conversely, the need- which is the actual need- to make sure that we want to do something and that we continue to want to do something in the long term in order to make progress over the long term.\",\n",

So the key thing: iso, i believe means are different, so isotope- different structure, i think is a very basic entomology of the word. So it's the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Really nice. So we know it's an atom of an element. I know it's carbon, for example, because it's got six protons but it has a different number of neutrons. So it's a slightly heavier or slightly lighter atom of that element. Really nice. An atom of an element. So you can add in same number of protons, they will in an exam they will be for the same mark. So if you say it's an atom of a specific element or if you say it's an atom with the same number of protons, they mean the same thing effectively. So they'd be for the same mark, an atom of an element with a different mass number- whoops, too many s's mass number. Or again, for the same part of the mark or the same mark, you can say different numbers of neutrons. So isotopes have different numbers of neutrons to each other. Really lovely.

Let's watch that again in slow motion. Just by adding a little electricity, we turn this screw and wire into a magnet. Why does that happen? I mean, we have a normal screw, a normal piece of wire. We run electricity through it and suddenly it becomes a magnet. We can understand what's going on there if we look at a compass and a wire. Here we've got your basic compass with the needle pointing north and south. Now let's say we put a wire near that compass and let's say that we run some electricity through the wire like this: watch what happens to the needle. As soon as we let electricity flow through the wire, the needle really responds to that electricity. So here's what's happening: if you take any piece of wire and you run electricity through it, the electricity will automatically create a magnetic field around that wire. It's kind of like a tube of magnetism that surrounds the wire and that tube of magnetism actually affected our compass. We could see that that magnetism was changing the way the compass needle pointed and that tells us that there's a magnetic field that's been created around this wire. Now let's say you take a wire and you wrap it around a screw or any other piece of metal. All those tubes of magnetism overlap and they line up along the length of the screw. That creates a very strong magnetic field right here in the center. We've created a magnet out of electricity. It turns out that you can do all kinds of experiments with electromagnets at home. All you need is a piece of metal like a screw, and some wire.\",\n",

Inverted pyramid is an isosceles triangle. Here is it again the isosceles triangle which stands on the top, so to speak. It's turned upside down, it points to the bottom, and the idea is that it's the employees who are the real heroes in the organization, the employees, because there is this shared mindset among everybody, also among the executive, that the so-called regular employees are those who do the work. They are on the front, they are close to the customer, they are the ones who add value, they are the real heroes and they are of highest importance. So the highest level of appreciation is experienced by the people and not by the ceo, and you can tell this really also, again, based on cultural artifacts.

So the solution is: fme provides us with the xml reader writer and then tools like xml updater that makes it easy to detect changes and then make updates as needed. So the result is: feature service has metadata that is automatically updated according to these latest updates and that merge basically happens. So let me just- this is kind of cool because it's actually not just a demo. This particular workflow comes from caltrans, so they were kind enough to share. This was kind of developed by trent at safe and he worked with them to build this, and so this is actually being used in a production system. So basically, on the left side here we have the metadata, the original metadata from the feature service, and then the updates, and they flow through here and i'll zoom in a little bit- read this a bit easier- and we'll just pop up a couple of the key transformers. So here's the change detector for changes in these attributes, and we can drill into the document structure of the xml using that tree control and look for changes and then, based on those changes, we do a number of updates here, and so these are all of the different xml objects that we're gonna update and merge in values that are coming from the update document, and then ultimately here xml updater lets us merge those values right into the xml structure. So why are we doing it this way and not with, let's say, a flattener and a templater? The nice thing about if you're going from xml to xml, it's nice to use the updater, because you don't have to kind of flatten and rebuild the whole structure.\",\n",

So we'll pick our customer. We can choose the location. We have a setup date, an activation date and an expiration date. Again, the setup date could be maybe 10 days before. Maybe it takes a few days for your it team to get things set up for the customer, but in this case it's 6-3 and 6-3.. The expiration date is calculated based on that year that we defined. Our renewal point and grace period came in from the contract template, as did our billing information and our invoice and line formulas. So here's our details for the contract. These are the two line items and they have a setup, a recurring amount of zero and a renewal price. Now, if we click on this item code, this is actually a contract item, and we call it a contract item because it's specific for contracts. It's not just, for example, a non-stock item. So some of the things that make this different than a typical non-stock item: first off is: what is the quantity that i want to use in contracts? In this case, we always want to use quantity one for this contract item. So maximum, minimum- and this is the default when we generate an invoice based on the setup. What non-stock item code do we want to use? The reason we have that is, our non-stock items carry a few pieces of information that we still need. To generate an invoice. We need to know how do we bill it, for example, what gl accounts to use.\",\n",

My second task will be test, and i say that i want to run tests in every project which has a test suffix, in every directory, every project which has a test suffix. Again with the release configuration. Let's see. But there's a bit of a difference here, because my projects are called in a single form, so it's test only. So these tasks are the building steps of your pipelines. What you need to do, step after step, to validate your project. First, i need to build my project. It will run net restore for me, so this is why i don't restore packages initially. Then i want to have a test here which i just say: run the test command on the net core cli task. You can see the different commands written here: build, test and so on: push, whatever, build it, build it and use this configuration. So let's save that and let's commit it. Let's commit the master branch. Of course you can also specify the trigger here. We only trigger when there is a change in the master branch. But you can configure it to use all kinds of branches, even with regular expressions. It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, okay. So azure pipelines- added tests to the azure pipelines.\",\n",

Die dritte elektrische größe, die wir kennenlernen werden, ist der elektrische widerstand. Der elektrische widerstand ist wie folgt definiert, und zwar beschreibt er die reibung der elektronen in einem leiter, das heißt, wie stark werden die elektronen in einem leiter abgelenkt bzw abgebremst? Das formelzeichen des elektrischen widerstands ist r wie resistance oder resistor, also englisches wort für widerstand, und die einheit ist das ohm mit einem großen omega dargestellt. Einige beispiele dazu: ein bügleisen hat beispielsweise einen elektrischen widerstand von 50 ohm, oder ein 100 meter bund mit einem querschnitt von 1,5 quadratmillimeter hat 1,19 ohm. Das ist schon ein sehr geringer widerstand. Das sieht man auch ein 1,5 quadrat im normalfall aus. Kupfer hat einen sehr geringen widerstand, ist ein guter elektrischer leiter.',\n",

So when i straighten my knee, use my quads. That's when it's getting harder. So you've got gravity and you've got a variable resistance which really helps you with trying to control the movement on the way down and then power the movement on the way up. So a really nice one to add some load on if you need to. Now, when you're running, you also need your soleus and it's often a forgotten muscle and you need a lot of time when you're midfoot running to push off. So we're going to do them off the floor, which is very relative to what you're doing when you're running. So if you imagine, when you run mid stance- okay, you're like that- what we want is a bent knee. If you have a straight knee, you're going to use gas shock. If you have a bent knee, you're going to use the lower calf, which is your soleus. I should say: try and keep not too much bend in the knee. Okay, i still want you to be able to see your foot because you don't run like that. All right, we're not right. At the end range, it's going to be too hard to push up.

So, yeah, i can't say, come check it out right now, because it's not there yet, but you can check out the beta version, if you want, of react query and then very soon we will launch the 10-stack branded version of it and then, obviously, like the other libraries, we can go agnostic.

Anyways, tying twigs with pieces of electrical copper wire is also a very practical way of building these makeshift dr seuss-like structures. They are also reusable so that when the twigs start to rot from one season to the next, as they inevitably do, i would disassemble the towers and rebuild them with new twigs, reusing the copper wires. To dress up the towers and add whimsy, i created finials on the top by bundling up weedy vines i had cleared from my peach trees. These were another resource masquerading as trash. All we need to transmute them into something magical is a bit of creativity and elbow grease. With these structures now in place, i could focus on the plants i wanted to introduce to make this space into a garden. Here's a sneak peek of how the garden has been transforming since i started with nothing but lawn. In an upcoming episode we'll delve into the plant side of creating a cottage garden, how to choose the right plants, how to grow them, where to place them, how to pick harmonious color schemes and compositions, and the problems that may arise. Until then, i hope you have fun imagining how you can structure or restructure your own garden into your green haven of peace. Thank you so much for watching this video.

Now if i like this colour, for instance, but i thought, uh oh, it's too dark, then all i do is just add a little bit of water to dilute it. So i can add a little bit of water and try it out with one coffee filter at a time. Let's see if that's lighter than the last one. I suspect it will be. So i like this colour and you can see the variation. So i'm going to take my coffee filters for one long stem rose. You're going to want one filter that is dark in colour, so your darker centre, and then you're going to want two filters for the petals on the outside. So it only takes 2-3 petals for each rose. But if you're making a bunch of roses, then yeah, you want to just make a whole bunch of coffee filters. You can always use them in another project at any time. So i'm just going to make a few more. Now. One thing that was really interesting was that i got this rose which goes from darker to lighter, so the tips of the petals are darker. Then it becomes a two toned rose, if you can see that. I've done one in the pink, i've done one in the yellow.\",\n",

Here's north, 45 degrees east, starting at north, marking out 45 degrees east. That's that direction. If s comes first, you've got to start on the south line, mark out the 20 degrees in the westerly direction, and that's south, 20 degrees west, and then finally south, 75 degrees east. Since s comes first, you start on the south line, mark 75 degrees in the easterly direction. So those are directions. Now let's go back to our problem. Okay, so now that we know what bearing is, let's go ahead and try to draw a nice picture for this and then solve the problem. Okay, now it gave us a bearing of north, 50 degrees west and it said the boat traveled for 15 kilometers. Alright, so when working with bearing problems, try to make a nice big picture. Give yourself lots of space. When you write a compass in front of yourself, north is usually up, south is down, west is to the left, east is to the right, and it kind of spells we. That's how i remember it. Now the bearing here says north, 50 degrees west. So we want to start from the north and then mark out 50 degrees in the westerly direction. So there's the bearing north, 50 degrees west and green.\",\n",

But regardless of when you got it, this confirms that it will be a reduction of your loan forgiveness. So even if you had the full amount of the loan forgiven, you've met all the qualifications. You fill out the application and it indicates loan forgiveness equal to your loan. If you got an eidl grant, the sba is going to reduce it. So when you'll experience that is, you're going to put the application into the lender, your application for forgiveness, and you're going to show here's the amount of forgiveness. The lender is going to determine if they agree, if there's any adjustments, and then the lender is going to submit that to the sba, as i indicated.

In other words, the teacher sets the level of mastery. In andragogy, need is diagnosed by mutual assessment and the teacher and the learner collaborate to determine what level of mastery is required. In pedagogy, the setting of objectives is done by the teacher again, and in andragogy, the teacher and the learner set objectives by mutual negotiation. You see the trend developing here: pedagogy is very much about the teacher. Andragogy is very much about the self-directed, independent learner who is motivated to learn. The designing of lesson plans: in pedagogy, the teacher just sets the content by the subject and the sequence is determined by the subject. In other words, the teacher says: this is what we're going to study and the subject dictates the sequence that is going to be utilized. In andragogy, you have such things as learning projects. Problem solving is key and it's sequenced by readiness to learn, in other words, what fits real life. How might we solve a real life problem and how then would it be structured? It is about involving the learner in the process of designing the learning plans. Learning activities differ substantially in pedagogy. Pedagogy is about transmittal of information. It may be about assigned readings and it's the traditional didactic approach. In andragogy we see inquiry projects, independent study, experimental techniques. Now in pedagogy, evaluation is done by the teacher and it's norm referenced and it generally has grades. I'm amazed sometimes as you get into higher learning, that people just freak out because they made a 92 versus a 93.

T will be scaled to be ct and those coordinates will be parameterized in terms of an affine parameter lambda. For a particle with mass, that parameter lambda would be the proper time, but for a massless particle we can't use proper time, so we use a generalized affine parameter lambda. The situation is we're going to have a rotating source mass. This oblates, phoroidal shape, dilated, bulging in the equatorial direction, so dilated away from the axis of rotation in the equatorial plane, in the equatorial plane direction and, as i said, it will be parameterized in terms of lambda. Tangent to these geodesics is the 4-velocity of the particle and throughout these two videos we'll work with the 4-velocity and the 4-momentum. Now both the 4-velocity and the 4-momentum are tangent to the geodesics at all points. So the 4-momentum vector and the 4-velocity vector are tangent. In terms of the 4-velocity, we have ct, dot, r, dot, theta dot, phi, dot as the coordinates and the magnitude of this vector for a particle with mass will be minus c squared. Now the magnitude is the 4-velocity vector, dotted with itself, the scalar or inner product of the vector gives us minus c squared and that will be the total derivative: dx, mu, the coordinates with respect to the parameter lambda. So x, dot, mu, the dot will stand for dx, mu, d, lambda. So it's differentiating the coordinates with respect to lambda.\",\n",

These coercive social systems are designed to serve the interests of those in the higher stratas of the system. Below some level in the hierarchy, the value of being part of the organisation is less than it returns. People remain in these lower positions because of coercion and dependency. This creates some subsystem that desires change. But above this theoretical line in the hierarchy, agents are receiving more than they are putting in through exploitation. This creates another subsystem that desires the maintenance of the social structure. The system then remains in its current configuration as long as the upper stratas have sufficient power and the lower stratas are sufficiently dependent. But conflict theory goes on to add that this does not last forever. At some point change happens, though, through some abrupt revolution. When agents give over their agency based upon their own perceived interests within an exchange system, we get what is called a utilitarian organisation. People engage in this type of organisation because they have something to gain. Thus, the culture is one of productivity and efficiency. Legitimacy is based on the organisation's or person's capacity to deliver in this exchange. Modern industrial societies are dominated by utilitarian organisations. With the enlightenment came the idea of reason and people as rational, self-interested agents driven to maximise their utility. From this new understanding of the individual we built a whole new set of social institutions that are fundamentally utilitarian in nature. They are designed to provide people with as much return on their investment of time, energy, money or freedom as possible. This is one way of understanding how economics and the idea of the market has become so dominant within modern society as an exchange mechanism for creating social order. A good example of a utilitarian organisation would be a business organisation.\",\n",

So that means there is a boundary that we have created, whether it is in terms of the username or the password or whatever it is. Otherwise anybody can get into this and that will lead to a lot of chaos and issues. So here we have created a boundary. Now tell me, guys, is this social interaction? Can it become social system? Yes, why? All the conditions are satisfied, the goals are there, which is common for both of us: that we want to score good in sociology. And then are we following the norms and values? Yes, are we creating a boundary around us? So this is a close group around us, whether it is a whatsapp group or this class sessions or whatever it is which is based on a certain kind of boundary. So this is what the definition of social system that i want you to write. Now, this is something which is derived out of that parsons actual definition, but if you can remember, if you can mug it up- see hardly you have few definitions, only if you can mug it up, you go with that. Even after explaining that, you can still further describe this level also. So let me show you this definition there. So, according to parsons, actions are oriented towards others and are in a state of mutual reciprocity. Social interaction takes place. So now we are at the level of interaction.\",\n",

So if there's a specific variable you want to go grab, you're going to have to go to the fred website and find the code.

But that data has been read in. So we can go data one- so that's the name of the data frame that we just created- describe and then empty parentheses, and what we should get is the basic summary statistics for our variable.

Lastly, i applied some gold highlight to the trim with a sponge, which can be a little tricky. Sometimes the sponge wanted to wrap over the edge of the trim and hit the armor, which is obviously something you want to avoid. This added a nice highlight to the gold, but in a spotty, weathered way. Bonus points, because it was pretty easy to do as well. I actually finished off the weathering portion of the night that gave us a lot of depth and highlights at school hall. We can essentially kill two birds with one stone, adding grit and grime and contrast at the same time. Now let's finish painting the model itself with a few extra parts. We've laid a good groundwork for this model to look cool from the tabletop. Now let's spice it up with some fun details. These are the kinds of choices that are like little easter legs for the paint job that people notice as they pick it up and look at the model over. We'll start with the chest mounted turret. I wanted to add some caution stripes to this. I think the idea works well because it naturally incorporates our spot color, which is yellow, without just painting the whole thing yellow. I began with a medium gray undercoat and started to build up highlights toward the top and the bottom of this shape that flares out toward the gun barrel. Then, with a combination of yellows as my highlight and oranges as my shadow, i sort of wet blend on top of these stripes. While the undercoat process wasn't entirely necessary, it helps to reach opacity very quickly with yellow and orange. Once i got the general look complete, i added in some weathering by painting some black chips and dings.\",\n",

Well, everything. That's not the quantum system, right? So the qubit perhaps, if we're thinking about a qubit, has to be sort of hermetically sealed in some kind of chamber and nothing from the environment is allowed to interact with the qubit. If we're going to look at the quantum system, nothing from the environment is allowed to interact with the qubit. If we're in an example of a closed quantum system, the minute we do a measurement on a quantum system, we're actually interacting with it. That's very crucial. The only way information can get out of a quantum system is by a measurement, and the minute you do a measurement, this quantum system is no longer closed. You open up a little window and you take a look in, and by looking in you're interacting with the system. This is something you should get used to. In quantum mechanics, information gain leads to disturbance of the system. That's a physical truism in quantum mechanics. Remember it. I'm not going to write it down here. But gaining information disturbs the quantum system. And gaining information you do so by measurement. But if you don't measure the system, if you gain no information about the quantum system, then the evolution of the system is described always by a unitary matrix: u. This turns out to be really crucial, this distinction between evolution and information gain and closeness. All right. So the evolution of a closed quantum system is described by a unitary matrix, and we describe evolutions in one of two equivalent ways. We could do either in the so-called schrodinger picture, where your preparation gets updated to a new preparation. And what's the new preparation after the system has evolved?\",\n",

These are a little tricky to analyze. There's lots of algorithms that we use. But subject-verb agreement at 12%, prepositions 12% and determiners were 62% of the edits that we made. Now, determiners refers to articles a and the. This that really small, seemingly non-important elements in your paper, but when you add them up they're extremely important and they affect quality of writing tremendously. So let's discuss three of these top issues that we found, these problems that we found. The first we're going to discuss is verb tense. As you probably all know, the purpose of the verb tense is to indicate the timing or action of a condition's existence. That's the definition of a verb. Surprisingly, many researchers are confused about which tense to use when they describe their research, and i don't blame them. There's specific rules for the different style of formatting guides, so you have to be careful of which to use. But here's a quick guide of which tenses you should generally use, generally speaking. You use the past tense when you're discussing prior research. Dr watson asserted that the mice in group b would be blind. So this is a prior research, not in this study. You use the past tense when discussing the result or observation made during your study, when you're observing the mice in group b. the mice in group b developed tumors in their parietal lobes. Okay, so these are real. You talk about these as you would a real event in life. Right, it's your observations in the present tense.\",\n",

The sender is the person that is going to be transmitting a particular message, and usually, if we're going to communicate something, we have to decide what it is that we're going to communicate, but not only what. We also have to determine how we're going to communicate that, the means through which we're going to actually communicate the message. This includes everything from face-to-face or verbal communication. This includes email or text and a variety of other mediums. Written communication, obviously, would fall into this category, and so the sender. What they do is they're in charge of what's called encoding a particular message, and encoding is not only determining what it is that you're going to say, but how it is that you're going to communicate it, including that nonverbal communication piece. Right, things like body language and the tone of our voice, the pace of our voice, whether or not we make eye contact all factors in to how we send a particular message. Now, the goal here for the sender- or at least it should be- is to communicate something as accurately as possible, and what that means is you have to take into account the knowledge and the education and the background of the receiver of that message, because if you communicate in a way that cannot be understood, then you're really just wasting your time. It's not very effective. The intent here is to be understood, and so obviously we have the message here and that is what is encoded. That message gets sent, of course, to the receiver. Depending upon what medium we chose to communicate with, that will transmit a number of different ways.\",\n",

We are just discussing that core point. What is that? In the present society, which is based on heterogeneity, which is based on individualism, which is based on organic solidarity, which is based on aspirational, a modern society, people are connected because of division of labor, because we seek in others what we lack in ourselves, and associations are formed wherever there is a true exchange of service.

Here's an example with water. So you could take liquid water, run electricity through it and break it down into two substances: hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. So this is an example of a decomposition reaction. Now for a single replacement, remember, there's one part of a substance that moves and becomes part of another substance. So here's zinc plus copper 2 chloride, forming copper plus zinc chloride. So notice, the chlorine was with copper and it was displaced and partnered up with the zinc. Here's another example: magnesium metal reacts with hydroiodic acid to make magnesium iodide plus hydrogen gas. So the iodine was with hydrogen and it was displaced. And now it's with the magnesium to make magnesium iodide, now again in a double displacement. This happens twice. So notice: silver nitrate plus potassium bromide goes to silver bromide and potassium nitrate. So the bromide was with potassium and it moved over here with the silver to make silver bromide. The nitrate was with the silver and it moved over with potassium to make potassium nitrate. So two different things were displaced. So it's a double displacement. Now another specialized type of double displacement, which we'll spend more time on in a future video, is an acid plus a base.

       "  'input_text': \"But sometimes mix engineers try to fix things that don't need repair or over-process a recording, only making it sound worse. They do this because the tool is available and it's tempting to use, their monitoring is misleading or because of lack of experience. The same thing can happen to an inexperienced mastering engineer too. This is where it plays for the mixing engineer to consult with an experienced mastering engineer before the mix is done. There is little we can do to fix a recording where one instrument or voice requires one type of equalization and the rest require others. Cone filtering is a complex problem that is not easily cured with an equalizer. Besides, in mastering, eq affects the entire mix, not just the offending instrument or voice. It's best to first discuss the problem with the mix engineer to see if he can address the offending track and remix it. If that's not possible, then possibly ask for a stem or, as a last resort, try an overall mastering eq, for example a lower mid-range eq boost to help a vocal that sounds thin due to cone filtering, even if it only touches one band of the cone filter. A perfect mix needs no mastering processing at all. Because of this, don't automatically begin equalizing, but listen and evaluate first. Many recordings that sound great leave the mastering studio with no equalization or processing. Linear phase equalizers the theory. All current analog equalizer designers and nearly all current digital equalizers produce phase shift when boosted or cut. That is, signal delay varies with frequency. The higher the q, the more phase shift. This kind of filter will always alter the musical timing and wave shape, also known as phase distortion. Whenever you have to equalize, you will always alter the signal in both the time and frequency domains.\",\n",

And you have to ask yourself: are we done? Have we finished rethinking the size of our stones and updating older cuts to fit our newer ideas about what makes a good stone? The answer, of course, is no, duh, we're never done. We're always desperate to smear new technology on old things, and diamonds are no exception. In a desperate move to advance technology and to use lasers, we're kind of right back where we were with the ancient ideas of the mughal cut covering the surface of a stone with facets, without really considering what's going on inside the internal relationship of what's happening. Char's jewelry made what they call the world's first all-diamond ring. It's essentially a 68 million dollar pun because there's nothing but diamond, and it was originally a 150 carat natural diamond. It was cut with lasers and has facets all over, so the outside surface sparkles, but gone is all of that understanding of what's happening inside. And the ring on the right is a 45 carat laboratory-grown diamond that has been cut using water jet and laser beams to the tune of $250,000, and they don't even know how many facets are on it. It has a never-before-seen amount of facets, between two and three thousand. It was designed by johnny ive, the apple computer designer, and mark newsome, celebrity designer.\",\n",

In this case, the pizza plan works out dearer, assuming we already have the ingredients for baking. We might instead opt for a time-based cost as well. This would make the baking option more costly. With costs assigned to each plan, when there are multiple, the cheapest one can be selected first. If there are multiple plans with the same lowest cost, then one can be pricked at random. A conceptualisation of a goap system looks like this, with actions, goals and world states being fed into a planner. The planner chains the actions together according to the goals and starting states to determine which plans are achievable. The planner uses the astar algorithm to find the best plan using the cost values. Once a plan has been generated, the agent goes about achieving it using a very, very simple finite state machine that basically moves the agent to where the action needs to take place and then performs the action. The agent works its way along the chain of actions until a goal has been achieved. Before each action is performed, it is always checked to see if it is still valid. If not, the entire plan is discarded and another one is generated. The beauty of goap is that more and more actions can be added to the pool available to the agent and these will automatically be picked up by the planner. This means very little extra programming to recognise graphs like the ones in complete setups of finite state machines, as the graphs are generated on the fly by the planner. This makes goap a very powerful and flexible option for programming the behaviours of your npcs. Thanks for watching.

So we will use the same data set that we have used so far, that is, the teaching evaluation data from university of texas, comprising 463 courses. We are looking at the teaching evaluation, beauty and age, and we're comparing the averages for these three variables. For female instructor variables, so those who are females- their average teaching evaluation was 3.9, compared to those of men, 4.06.. Here we are looking at the average teaching evaluation for tenured professors: 3.96 versus untenured: 4.13.. The average age of untenured professors was 50.2 years and that for tenured professors 47.85 years. One thing that is very important in statistical analysis is to think about the question and to think about the population or sample that you are working with. We are computing averages across 463 courses and we find the average age or beauty, but these are the attributes of instructors. We know from our data that there are 94 instructors who have collectively taught 463 courses, and we know that there are duplicates. That is, the same instructor who has taught multiple courses. So when i compute the average age using 463 courses, it's not necessarily the average age of the instructors, because it could be true that older-aged individuals may have taught more courses than younger individuals, resulting in a higher average. That is not necessarily the average age of the instructors. So to avoid this problem, we have to subset the data so that we remove the duplicates and have only one observation per individual instructor in the data set. So instead of 463 observations we should have just 94 observations. Now let's look at the comparison.\",\n",

And the other thing that you can use- besides just having them as long stem roses, like i've got here and that looks fantastic- is that i've used a mixture of the long stem roses and the large roses in a very short bouquet- and this is just dry floral foam that i've got in a little jar- and created a short bouquet which is beautiful for the center of your table because it's short and you can see people on the other side. So the first thing that we are going to do, or the first thing that i'm going to show you, which may be a repeat for some people, but in any event it's a good refresher- is: you're going to dye your coffee filters and you're dyeing it basically in water and food colouring. So we're going to try, and you want to dye about 4 sheets at a time, and the reason that you want to dye about 4 or 5 sheets at a time is you want to make sure that the colour goes all the way through. But when you go to dry them- which we are going to dry these on a cookie sheet at 225 degrees for 15 minutes- they will dry perfectly. That way, if you pile layer too many, it will take longer to dry. That's all, but it's not the end of the world. So something that i've noticed which makes the flowers even more realistic is having a darker tone in the centre of the rose. So in this example, i used a darker colour of the same pink for the centre and then lighter colours.\",\n",

The third control is frequency. This determines which frequency the band affects. How we use an equalizer in the mastering stage can differ greatly from how one is used during mixing. I'd now like to look at some equalization principles and techniques that are common in mastering. An eq technique used in mastering can be crucially different from an apparently similar technique used in mixing. For example, when mastering, adjusting the low bass of a mix will affect the perception of extreme highs. Similarly, if a snare drum sounds dull but the vocal sounds good, then the voice may suffer when you try to equalize for the snare. These problems occur even between different elements in the same frequency range. During mixing, bass range instruments that exhibit problems in their harmonic range can be treated individually, but in mastering their harmonic range overlaps with the range of other instruments. Another key to effective mastering is that everything starts with the mid-range. The fundamentals of the vocal, guitar, piano and other instruments must be correct or nothing else can be made right. Parametric and shelving. There are two basic types of equalizers- parametric and shelving- named after their characteristic curves. Parametric eq, invented by george mason berg in 1967, is the most flexible curve, providing three controls: center frequency, bandwidth level, boost or cut. The parametric curve, also known as the peaking or bow curve, is also the most popular eq shape used in mastering, because it can be used surgically to remove certain defects such as an overly resonant bass instrument, or enhance narrow ranges of frequencies.\",\n",

We noted how these two phenomena of agency and structure are deeply interdependent, with social structure emerging out of individuals giving over and combining their agency within organisations that both enable the individuals and constrain them. We talked about the different types of social structures and how they can be understood in terms of the conditions under which the agents gave over their choices and actions, starting on the most basic level of coercion that places an emphasis on structure over agency in a rigid hierarchical organisation resistant to change. Next, we talked about utilitarian organisations, where agents partake in exchange relations based on mutual self-interest, with the result being bureaucratic organisations focused on efficiency that have come to be dominant in modern industrial societies. Finally, we talked about the normative organisations we get when people voluntarily coordinate towards some collective function that is of a normative value, through an inclusive decision making process.',\n",

They represent the different manners of articulation or the way that you can cut up the airflow as it passes through your vocal tract. These generally go in the chart from most closed to most open, so from top to bottom. So up top we have plosives, which are also known as stops. Like you'd guess from the name, these are pronounced by stopping the air completely and then letting it go again. Our old friends pə, tə and kə are here, as well as bə, də and gə, and of course there are other stops too, like the qə that we talked about earlier. Whenever you're pushing air from your lungs and it can't escape from your mouth until you let go, that's a stop. But what if you stop air from getting out of your mouth but you leave another escape route, like, say, through your nose? Down one row we have the nasals, your ns and ns, but also the ng we saw before. Here the air only comes out of your nose. There's a complete stop in your mouth, but you lower your soft palate and the air rushes out the only way it can: through your nasal cavity. That's why when you have a cold and your nose is plugged up, your ns sound a lot like dəs, də and nə are the same sound if you take your nose away. The next rows are for sounds that are like stops, but just executed really rapidly. Trills involve closing and opening the airflow multiple times quickly in the same place, just drumming one articulator against another.\",\n",

It seems like something that someone new to react could easily get confused around. So how would all of you try and explain something like this to someone who's less well-versed in react? Kent, let's raise his hand. I've got a very simple definition for what a hook is. A hook is a function that uses other hooks.\",\n",

Triangular bandages can be also made into slings. One type of sling is made by lying the triangle across the chest and over the shoulder. The two ends then can be tied behind the neck to support the forearm, to support the elbow, either twist and tuck in the third corner or fold and attach with a clip. Major bleed: attending to a major bleed must be done with speed and accuracy. Apply direct pressure on the wound with a sterile dressing. Elevate the limb and keep pressure on the wound while you wrap a roller bandage around the wound site. Remember to keep applying pressure. Internal bleeding: internal bleeding can be just as serious as external bleeding. Some of the signs and symptoms of internal bleeding are pale, cold and clammy skin, rapid and weak pulse, shallow and rapid breathing, light headedness, restlessness or faintness, coughing, frothy red blood, vomiting, brown or red blood passing, red or smoky tarry faeces, red or smoky urine and decreased levels of consciousness. To care for internal bleeding, make sure the person is comfortable, treat to minimise shock and seek medical assistance. Remember: do not apply pressure to an injured area and do not give food or fluids. Embedded objects: when dealing with embedded objects, it is best to leave the object in the wound, treat the area with a doughnut bandage and apply a roller bandage around the whole area.',\n",

They are still rooted in observing nature, even if it is in a more loose and expressive fashion. The result of this shifting of concerns was the creation of room for the artist to express themselves, expression of the artist's feelings regarding their subject, expression through the interaction of colour, shape, space and line. This was the reason matisse and his mates had abandoned realism and apparent good taste. They sacrificed the surface appearance of reality in order to find a way to express a deeper and surpassing sense of beauty, which was to be found in colour, brushwork and composition. As far as examples of the movement go, matisse's portrait woman with a hat is fairly emblematic. So let's take a look at that to see some of those beastly traits in action. The painting's subject, matisse's then wife amélie, was not so much the cause for concern. As with most fauvist works, it is a fairly standard subject for a painting, in this case a portrait of a well-to-do woman in her finery, not a million miles away from renoir's portraits of the new wealthy urban classes from a few decades before. The controversial part is, of course, not the subject, but the way she was painted. The work's surface is composed of a patchwork of bright colours brushed onto the canvas with apparent speed and excitement. Worse than that, in between the cacophony of colours there are bare patches of empty canvas which matisse seemingly hasn't painted at all. As a painter, you have one job: covering things in paint.

When you discuss about political science, when you discuss about philosophy, when you discuss about economy, marx is coming everywhere. Alright, guys, so if you have this much strength in thinkers, then will you face this? Do you even want anything from here this side? No, right, i do not think how far sociologists justified in using positivist approach to understand reality direct. Here we have discussed positivism and its critique. So we discussed about august comte, we discussed about simon, we discussed about durkheim. So everything related to positivism, the elements of positivism, what to study external reality, empirical reality, and then make universal theory, use scientific methods, establish cause and effect, and then objectivity need to be ensured: testing, theory building, prediction, all those things we have discussed. And we have discussed a lot of illustrations and examples with respect to durkheim itself. You can use any of the theories and the criticism. Also our sociology related to common sense, sociology and common sense. So here you will get it. So that question is also answered. Guys, this is a very good one and i should be getting very good score in this. I should not face any problem in this particular question as well. So i am done with that. Now i am going with this.

So two and a half percent under the curve in each tail and graphically you could see this again as the same as we saw earlier, that this is a normal distribution curve and two and a half percent is in the left tail and the other two and a half percent is in the right tail. And if the test statistic is 1.96, if the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than 1.96 or less than 1.96, it falls in the rejection region and you can safely reject the null. And the null would be that the difference of mean equals to zero or, in common parlance, what we are saying is that the two means are not the same. Now let us work with the assumption or the situation where we we are testing. If the difference of means is less than zero, we are only interested in the left tail. Our alternative hypothesis is that the difference of mean is less than zero. In this case, the entire rejection region, that is, five percent of the rejection region, is to the left and in any situation in for a one tail test. If we were to get the t stat of 1.64 or less, we would reject the null that the mean is greater than zero in favor of the alternative that the difference is less than zero. And the exact opposite to this would be the right tail test, where the alternative hypothesis is that the mean is greater than zero. And if you get the t or test statistics of greater than 1.64 for a right tail test, you reject the null in favor of the alternative that the mean difference is greater than zero.',\n",

So those are two choices for how you might get into this. I'm guessing that they do mean for this to be a sort of reveal that we're going from one place to another. So i think breaking this up in two parts will make more sense. Now, when i asked the writer, andrew, if i could use his scene, he said he'd already rewritten it based on the feedback he'd gotten off of script notes. So let's take a look at the version of the scene that he wrote. So this: so this is the scene that he wrote. So this: so it is meant to be a hospital interior, a hospital room, day, close on a woman's face, asleep in bed. Her head rests on a plain white pillow. Slow dolly back, revealing more of the woman in her surroundings. Sterile and white. The lighting is almost too bright, like we're in a dream or a memory. I like all that.

If you're in a minor scale, the difference between major and minor chords is small in terms of only being off by one semitone, but they make a world of difference in the tone they create. From here chords can be expanded upon, to be spiced up a little bit. For example, a c-major triad has the notes c, e, g, recall. These are the 1,, 3, and 5 notes in the major scale. If i were to add the note b, this is now a c-major 7th chord, since i added in the 7th note in the scale in addition to my triad. From here you can use the tricks covered in this video to write chord progressions or melodies that are in key and sound good together, and you'll know why. I think that's the best part about music theory. I used to be able to cobble something together when producing music when i didn't even know any music theory, but it would just take way too long and ultimately not even sound that good. However, once i took the time to pick up the basics of music theory, my songwriting improved tenfold. So hopefully this video helped you gain a little bit of knowledge in some sort of aspect.

Okay, now let's look for n. to figure out n i can use trig. N is the side adjacent and i have the hypotenuse and so for that i know cosine of theta is defined to be adjacent over hypotenuse. So in this particular case cosine of 50 degrees equals right. The side adjacent is n, so n over 15, and then cross multiplying 15 cosine of 50 is equal to the n, or in other words, n is approximately. Our answer here: 15 cosine of 50, approximately 9.6 kilometers. So that's how far north the boat went. And then here's how far the boat went in westerly direction. So we found those values.

Yeah, i think. Well, i mean, i think i like the idea of a sort of like having that traceability. I mean i think, like you know, a lot of people don't talk about metadata a lot, but i think, like, knowing where your data came from is like probably a good start. Like cataloging, inventorying, just to have an inventory- i think you know, and there are some- it doesn't have to be the best inventory. I think you need to start with something. I think that one of the drivers for governance, too, is the idea that, like before, we would make a map and we would highly curate the data, like a gis professional would sit behind their desk and analyze the data and make sure it's good, make sure it's good, make sure it's good and then finally deliver the data. Now these things are integrated, live into other systems. So i think that that, actually that automation aspect, that ability to deliver data pretty immediately for decision-making, i think honestly, that's been a big driver too. Yeah, and, like you're saying, the metadata is key and nobody wants to sit there and fill out metadata forms. So that update has to be automated, it has to be part of the data update is the metadata update. And now you know well, is this current data or is it 10 years old?\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"Chords- chords are multiple notes played in harmony at the same time. The most common type of chord consists of three notes and therefore is called a triad. A chord is named after its root note and its quality. For example, this is a c-major chord. An easy way to remember how to make major chords is to pick your root note and draw in another note four semitones above that, and then finally one more three semitones above that note, or a total of seven above your root. Another, even quicker way to remember major triads is to draw in a major scale using the trick previously described. Let's pretend i want to be in f-major. Now pick any note to be the root of my chord, let's say a-sharp from here. Draw in a note at every other key in the scale moving upwards. In this case we skip over c, the next highest note in the f-major scale. Draw in a note at d, skip over e and draw in a note at f. for this reason the major chord is referred to having the pattern of 1-3-5,, since our root is the first note and from here we use the third and fifth notes in the scale respectively, we now have an a-sharp major chord and, just like magic, it also follows the pattern we previously described, where the gap between the root and the second note is four semitones and the gap between the root and the third is seven. And making minor triad chords is also very similar. In fact, the only difference from a major triad is you drop the second note down by one semitone. So to make a b-minor chord, for example, draw in your root note at b, move up by three semitones again, rather than four in a major chord, and then your third note four semitones above that.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': \"I'd now like to look at some equalization principles and techniques that are common in mastering. An eq technique used in mastering can be crucially different from an apparently similar technique used in mixing. For example, when mastering, adjusting the low bass of a mix will affect the perception of extreme highs. Similarly, if a snare drum sounds dull but the vocal sounds good, then the voice may suffer when you try to equalize for the snare. These problems occur even between different elements in the same frequency range. During mixing, bass range instruments that exhibit problems in their harmonic range can be treated individually, but in mastering their harmonic range overlaps with the range of other instruments. Another key to effective mastering is that everything starts with the mid-range. The fundamentals of the vocal, guitar, piano and other instruments must be correct or nothing else can be made right. Parametric and shelving. There are two basic types of equalizers- parametric and shelving- named after their characteristic curves. Parametric eq, invented by george mason berg in 1967, is the most flexible curve, providing three controls: center frequency, bandwidth level, boost or cut. The parametric curve, also known as the peaking or bow curve, is also the most popular eq shape used in mastering, because it can be used surgically to remove certain defects such as an overly resonant bass instrument, or enhance narrow ranges of frequencies. By comparison, shelving equalizers are more popular in mastering than in mixing, since they provide boosts or cuts to the entire spectrum below or above a selected frequency and can alter the tonality of the entire mix. Gentle equalizer slopes almost always sound more natural and less harsh than sharp ones, so q values of 0.6 and 0.7 are therefore very popular in bow shapes and gentle slopes.\",\n",

The good news is, neither do most of the other students who are taking this exam. They also don't remember some of the terms. They might not remember the same ones as you.

Now we can go, use some inquiries on your equifax and use your trade union to get more cards or more funding or a personal loan or something like that.

You know what i'm saying. I'll still lower it, even from $40, but you don't want to have a whole lot of inquiries if you don't have to have them, if that makes sense.

So note that what she's saying is here. You can't just call a strike the night before. That's not how it works. It's highly constrained, significantly. The union in this matter had learned well the lessons of 2018 when they were cancelled. The action proposed was carefully calibrated to avoid the kind of threat to welfare, health, safety or life that would require the commission to make an order suspending it. The inability of management clearly to articulate this threat and to seek an order on sunday suspending the action on this basis speaks volumes about the credibility of the claim itself and casts a serious cloud over the necessity of the management's decision to shut down the network. But now the management's withdrawn its work commission claim. What happens next? So note that they had to claim in for the work in the commission fair work commission and they have withdrawn it. Since the union's right to take protected industrial action is not suspended and it insists the proposed action is safe. If it's genuinely not safe, as claimed, management seek a suspension order under section 424, sending the parties back to the bargaining table. Otherwise, the union action will continue in accordance with the scheme of the act and if management choose to shut down the network again, it should own the decision for what it genuinely is, and this is shea's opinion: a lockout in support of its bargaining claims, not an employee strike.

And this is going to bring a bunch of options so that you don't have to type them, but you actually want to select them over here. So in this case, what we want to do is to use the, let's say, the test command, because we want to build the code and then test the code right and what's the path to the project.

       "  'input_text': 'If there are multiple plans with the same lowest cost, then one can be pricked at random. A conceptualisation of a goap system looks like this, with actions, goals and world states being fed into a planner. The planner chains the actions together according to the goals and starting states to determine which plans are achievable. The planner uses the astar algorithm to find the best plan using the cost values. Once a plan has been generated, the agent goes about achieving it using a very, very simple finite state machine that basically moves the agent to where the action needs to take place and then performs the action. The agent works its way along the chain of actions until a goal has been achieved. Before each action is performed, it is always checked to see if it is still valid. If not, the entire plan is discarded and another one is generated. The beauty of goap is that more and more actions can be added to the pool available to the agent and these will automatically be picked up by the planner. This means very little extra programming to recognise graphs like the ones in complete setups of finite state machines, as the graphs are generated on the fly by the planner. This makes goap a very powerful and flexible option for programming the behaviours of your npcs. Thanks for watching.

So i can add a little bit of water and try it out with one coffee filter at a time. Let's see if that's lighter than the last one. I suspect it will be. So i like this colour and you can see the variation. So i'm going to take my coffee filters for one long stem rose. You're going to want one filter that is dark in colour, so your darker centre, and then you're going to want two filters for the petals on the outside. So it only takes 2-3 petals for each rose. But if you're making a bunch of roses, then yeah, you want to just make a whole bunch of coffee filters. You can always use them in another project at any time. So i'm just going to make a few more. Now. One thing that was really interesting was that i got this rose which goes from darker to lighter, so the tips of the petals are darker. Then it becomes a two toned rose, if you can see that. I've done one in the pink, i've done one in the yellow. So these are two tones, and in order to get those tones, you're going to dye your coffee filters.\",\n",

So these settings include how long the term is, what the renewal period and the grace period is, who to bill, how to bill them. So let's take a quick look at the contract template and then we'll finish our contract. So the contract template has a certain type: renewable, expiring and unlimited. Expiring is essentially the period, the duration of the contract, but at the end you can't renew it. Renewable is similar, but you can continue to renew it at the end of the period. Unlimited means the contract has no end date, it just goes on forever, and this may be applicable if you're using the contract to do, for example, a monthly billing. So here's our duration. So it's one year, but we can choose different increments here if we want to. If the contract is refundable. We turn this on here. The refund period within 30 days. Mass renewal allows us to open up a process screen where we can see all of our contracts and renew them from one place. But if you want to handhold this contract, then you may uncheck this. Our renewal period is 30 days before it expires. This means that inside the contract, we can do an actions: renew 30 days prior to the expiration. So we have that window.

It's the deliberate part of this is you have to do it consciously and intentionally. You've got to pay attention to what you're doing. It's not that you practice, it's how you practice. You have to do it in a fully considered way. You got to pay attention to what you're doing. Don't be impulsive about that. Control your practice, and that is what leads to success.

So, without further ado, i will pass this over to dr vicki gibson, who will be talking with us today about classroom management for differentiating instruction and collaborative practice, dr gibson, thank you. Thank you for the nice introduction and thank you for those of you that are working with us today. I want to begin with this- and this is some of the newest research, which is basically a finding- that learning takes place in the absence of disruption, and i think that the challenge for teachers, especially implementing standards-based instruction, is managing the flexible grouping so that they are experiencing less problems with behavior and can focus more time and attention on their instruction. The research on classroom management really reports nothing new. Recently, we already know that an organized environment significantly enhances and impacts student achievement. So my job today is basically: i want to talk to you about ways to structure that environment that are affordable and practical. They work, they're evidence-based, so that you can implement standards-based differentiated instruction and collaborative practice, and we'll talk a little bit about standards-based instruction. But what do we want classroom environments to do for us when we are teaching? We want to encourage self-regulation, so that means we need routines and procedures that students can follow and develop as daily habits for when they enter a classroom, so that we are focused more on instructional management, delivering content, providing collaborative practice and feedback, and less on environmental management. We want our environment to support our instruction. So assisting students with achieving the outcomes and the standards is going to require some changes in classroom practices. In other words, we're going to have to depart from some of our traditional habits if we are using mostly whole class lecture format for our delivery of this more rigorous content.\",\n",

International business is technically defined as all commercial transactions, including sales, investments and transportation, that take place between two or more countries. In other words, it is the act of doing business across national borders. The reality is that when you cross national borders, many of the taken-for-granted assumptions about the way the business world works need to be re-examined. Take opening up a restaurant in the united states, for example. When you do business in the us, there are many external factors that are fairly consistent across companies and even industries. You assume that you can pay your employees what you want, as long as you don't go below the minimum wage and meet other basic work requirements, all of which are readily available, you can assume that these requirements will not change much over time. You can also assume that the government will not mind if you open up another restaurant. As long as you get a business permit and a food license, you're good to go. You also correctly assume that you will be able to either buy or rent a building for your restaurant and that you can choose the location. You can search on your own or through a realtor, and you'll be able to negotiate the price. You are also fairly familiar with the local tastes and preferences, so you have an idea of what foods people will like. Essentially, they like what you like. You assume that the us dollar will hold its value and that people will be able to pay with cash or credit cards. You assume that you will not be asked for bribes to open or continue with your business and that you will not need to pay protection money to organized crime leaders in your area.

But anyway, a logarithm is not defined for a zero argument, so you assert that x is not zero. Moreover, the function here is implemented with a lookup table, so you additionally assert that you don't index beyond the end of the table. So now, in main, you just call the div and log functions with various parameters and print the results. The last two calls intentionally violate the assertions, so that you can see what happens. Now i will demonstrate how to build and run that simple program on a desktop computer from the command prompt using the gcc compiler. The code will be provided in the lesson 47-underscore-desk directory. If you work on windows as i do here, you might not have the gcc compiler, but one way of getting it is to download the qp bundle for windows, which, among others, contains a mingw gcc toolset. You build the assert program with gcc as follows. When you run the assert executable, you can see that the program continues until an assertion fails, whereas the printout tells you the assertion expression and the line of code where the failure occurred. In a regular run, the output produced by the program and the error message from the failing assertion are combined. But when you redirect the output into the stdout and stderr streams, you can see that the failing assertion sends the error message to the stderr stream, whereas the normal output from the program goes to the stdout stream. Finally, you can see that the failing assertion apparently aborts the program because the final end output is not produced. This is consistent with the premise that continuing after a failing assertion makes no sense.\",\n",

In medicine, such as surgery, pathology and radiology, precise terminology must be used to accurately describe the location of the procedure, for example, a change in pathology or a radiographic abnormality. Key regions of the body can be described using anatomical landmarks. Using this image, let's describe the different regions of the body, beginning with the head. The forehead, the buckle or cheek and the chin make up the cranium and facial, which together make up the cephalon or head. The trunk of the body includes the beginning of the thorax, the mammary or breast, the abdomen, the umbilicus or navel, as well as the pelvis. The armpit is also known as the axilla, and the bicep region of the arm is known as the brachium. The antecubitus is the front of the elbow and the antebrachium is the forearm. The manus or hand includes the carpus or wrist as well as the palm. The lower part of the body, the kneecap, is also known as the patella and the shin area is the crust. The ankle is known as the tarsus and at the foot, the digits or toes, as well as the hallux or great toe. We use this image to describe the posterior anatomical landmarks. The upper limb is the arm and the lower limb is the leg, the cephalon or head, and the cervicus or neck region. The shoulder can also be called the acromion, the back, the dorsum or the back, is about the middle of the back and the lower back is the lumbus or loin.\",\n",

The horizontal, crosswise or from left to right can be named as segment st or segment ts. In the following number line, the segment whose end point is located at the coordinate of negative 1 and 1 is denoted as line segment bd or segment db. Likewise, a segment that has a coordinate at negative 2 and 2 is denoted as segment ae or segment ea. So we learned about lines which extend forever and ever in both directions, and we learned about segments which have a definite length and do not go on forever and ever. Is it possible to create a figure that contains both of these characteristics? The answer is yes. These hybrids are called rays. Rays, like lines and segments, are made up of points and are straight. A ray differs from a line or segment in that it begins at an end point and then extends infinitely far in one direction only. Segments extend in two directions. Rays extend in one direction only, so make sure you keep that in mind. The following are examples of rays. Now, when it comes to denoting them, we actually need to be careful and make sure we start denoting a ray by naming its end point first. This way, it becomes clear where the ray begins. So the ray in the left is denoted as ray ab. Notice that we add a ray on top, going from left to right. This is the appropriate way to denote rays. It would be completely wrong to denote the ray as ray ba. Remember, we want to start with the end point first. The ray in the right can be called ray rs or ray rt, as long as the end point is given first. Any other point on the ray can be used to denote the ray.',\n",

Die idee wird zu einer maschine, die die kunst macht. Und schließlich gibt es noch eine einschlägedefinition von joseph korshut, einem konzeptkünstler, und er schreibt: kunstwerke sind analytische propositionen. Das besagt, dass sie keinerlei information über irgendwelche tatsachen liefern. Ein kunstwerk ist insofern eine tautologie, als es die intention des künstlers aufzeigt. Gut, wenn man jetzt diese vier charakterisierungen sich anschaut und versucht, sie auf diese exemplarischen, kanonischen konzeptkunstwerke anzuwenden, dann merkt man sehr schnell, dass sie immer nur auf einige wenige beispiele passen, und das heißt so viel, dass die konzeptkünstler eigentlich eine legitimation ihrer eigenen werke geschaffen haben mit diesen konzeptkunstdefinitionen.',\n",

       "  'input_text': \"Hungry equals false. The goal is the end state of the agent, not the starting state. If you think about it, a recurring human goal is to have hungry equal false as often as possible. Plans can generally only occur when the world and or the agent are in a particular state. For this example, let's add two: has ingredients is true and has phone number is true. The planning stage in goap always works backwards from the goal to see if it is achievable. It does this by matching the effects with preconditions into a chain. It works all the way back to the world states. If it can't find a matching world state, at the end the plan is abandoned. In this example, there are two possible plans available: order a pizza and bake something to eat. Notice the reuse of the eat action. It fits into both plans and illustrates how actions can be mixed and matched to form different plans. As long as the preconditions and effects fit together, any actions can be chained together. Now that we have two plans that will achieve the goal, which one do we choose? Simple, we add a cost to the plans. We might assign each action a monetary cost. In this case, the pizza plan works out dearer, assuming we already have the ingredients for baking. We might instead opt for a time-based cost as well. This would make the baking option more costly. With costs assigned to each plan, when there are multiple, the cheapest one can be selected first. If there are multiple plans with the same lowest cost, then one can be pricked at random. A conceptualisation of a goap system looks like this, with actions, goals and world states being fed into a planner. The planner chains the actions together according to the goals and starting states to determine which plans are achievable. The planner uses the astar algorithm to find the best plan using the cost values.\",\n",

But by repeating these kinds of reasonings you'll get practice at them. Ok, that's an example of a quantum state. It turns out it's not pure. And the reason we can say that so very quickly is that the eigenvalues of a pure state, represented by a matrix like this, has one eigenvalue equal to 1 and the rest equal to 0. And that would mean the determinant is 0.. So i'm going to give you an example now of a pure state. Let's see if i can just think one up. Here's one: this is a pure state. Now, how can we convince ourselves of this fact? Well, think about this trick i showed above: the determinant of rho is 0.. So that's a good starting point. It's positive because the trace is 1.. But this doesn't tell us immediately that the state is pure. Pure means that rho is a matrix which has specifically this form where you can write it as a column vector times by a row vector, and i'm going to do that right now. You can write rho in this form here: root 2, 1 over root 2, 1 over root 2.. So you can always write rho like this: the product of this column vector times by this row vector. This always kind of freaks. There's a kind of freak out moment when you see this thing here. How can you multiply this? Well, you can.

Send them all to take training together and again they come back and they talk about it. It bonds them together as individuals through a shared experience. Shared meals is also a very powerful team-building activity and there's a couple of ways that this can go. At one company where i worked, the general manager would have a monthly all-hands meeting and at this meeting they'd serve breakfast. But the breakfast was prepared each month by different teams from the organization, different departments. The teams would compete to see who could make the most extravagant, the wildest, the greatest breakfast possible. They worked together as a team to make breakfast and then they'd serve it in the conference room while the general manager gave a report on the state of the business. Everybody would sit down for a shared meal, which was a very powerful team-building activity. You could also have everybody go out for meals. You could have a dumpling night, a pasta night or a pizza night. Another msp owner said that his company brings in lunch for everybody once a week. He said it was a perk, that they offered a benefit. But i'll say it's way more than a perk or a benefit. It's a wonderful team-building and bonding activity to sit down for a shared meal. So find ways for your team to share experiences.

Well, while there's nothing wrong with having a garden like that, they usually lack a focal point, and that's another element of design. To create a focal point, we need to establish hierarchies and use the power of line and rhythm to direct the eye towards the focal point. Traditionally, tree-lined paths called alleys have been used to frame out focal points in the distance. Generally, focal points are created by difference in complexity. It can be a statue, a group of colorful plants, a house, an unusual tree, etc. Balance and symmetry are the next elements. They organize the other elements to create order and harmony. A symmetrical composition is usually balanced and pleasing, but can also be too stiff. An asymmetrical but still visually balanced composition is often more dynamic and naturalistic. Finally, value, color and texture are the last element that can contribute to balance, symmetry, rhythm and focal point. A small, bright, active, colorful cluster can balance out larger, heavier, duller masses. Repeating value, color or texture likewise can create organizing rhythm and also establish focal points. By studying these elements of design, we can create better compositions and understand why they work. With the more large-scale garden structures in place, i could now turn my attention to creating small-scale supports for plants. If you organize the big picture first, small-scale structures will fall in place. I'm doing a few more of the rustic towers.

But the problem is not just there. Look at the second slide to the right. We can see what the business analyst understood. Here we see a small sailboat with a fan attached to it and it's unplugged. What kind of functionality is that? Then we see what the sales team described. And the sales team, what they will be selling, or what they will be describing, looks like this huge yacht with trained dolphins on a sunset. But look at what the project management team actually delivered: a submarine with sails and a plug that is not even plugged- not practical at all. What was actually documented is nothing, and that is one of the main problems in project management: the lack of documentation. But when we see what the customer was paid for, he paid for the titanic, but it was implemented the same way that the titanic was implemented, and the type of support that was provided was probably the same kind of support that the victims of the titanic accident had to go through. Now, what the customer actually needed was a very simple type of sailboat in order to satisfy their needs. But look at the disparities between what the customer needed and what the customer requested. So it's not just a matter of listening what they're saying, but understanding what they need. And once you understand their need, it's important to have a clear, transparent and smooth communication throughout the entire project management team to ensure that this kind of mistakes don't happen. Now, the customer is not the only person whose the project is going to have an impact on. Here is when the concept of stakeholders needs to be analysed.\",\n",

I like to think of it like from this point of view, because i'm kind of like dean. It's like governance doesn't always sound like the most exciting idea sometimes, but when you think about what it allows you to do, that's what's really exciting. So how does it help us? Well, if you want to build something really significant- and you know and you want it to, you know, last, over time and in the world now, that's, you know, a multi-user, multi-systems, multiple platforms, and where gis data is getting kind of like integrated into other business processes and lines, this is where governance really comes into play, because this is what really allows us to really build something significant and exciting.

Effective writing style, since style affects the readability, the comprehension and engagement with readers of a particular journal. This is extremely important to journal editors and publishers, for the ultimate goal of the journal is to have it be read by a wide readership. So the whole purpose of this presentation is to give you practical ways to improve the quality of your writing. What i want to convince you is that, by acting in the role of researcher, author and editor, all three of those manuscript writers can take control when it comes to getting their work published. So to add to this evidence that quality of writing does play a role in our journal acceptance or rejection, i want to show you a 2013 study of papers that were submitted to medical journals. These were papers based in african and asian countries, some of the journals you may even be familiar with. In this study, there were 42 papers analyzed and they found crucial flaws in every section of the manuscripts. Just a few stats from this: nearly 68% had problems in the introduction and results section, so almost 70% introduction and results. 86% had flaws in material and methods section and 71% in the discussion section. So, as you can see, the errors are manifold and various throughout the essay. But what do we mean by flaws? The author gives some details about this in the results. They discuss that there's insufficient background information, inappropriate review of literature, a lack of a clear problem statement and research objectives, an introduction whose lengths were inappropriate, and there's actually quite a bit more. I thought this was particularly interesting. The end of the results. Here the authors say that a large proportion of the reviewed articles lacked good grammatical writing.\",\n",

So here are the fundamental, the basics of regression model. First of all, you need a question to answer using regression model. For instance, do male instructors get higher teaching evaluations than female instructors? Or does the beauty score decrease with the age of the individual instructor? Or is there an association between an instructor's looks and the teaching evaluation score they receive? Do good-looking professors get higher teaching evaluation scores? So with these questions in mind, we focus now on the terminology of regression model. So there are two types of regression variables that we use. One is a dependent variable. That is the variable that we are really interested in, for example the teaching evaluation score of an individual instructor, and the explanatory variables that explain the variance or differences or values of the dependent variable. So, for example, teaching evaluation score could be explained by the looks or the gender or the english language proficiency of an individual instructor. So you have two types of variables: dependent and explanatory. Now let's look at the notation for a regression model. The dependent variable is donated as y, so this y would be the teaching evaluation score and the explanatory variables are denoted as x's. So beauty, the gender and the english language proficiency would be an x, and the underlying assumption is that y is explained by x, that is, teaching evaluation score. Y is explained by x, that is the beauty score. Or y is a function of x, which we write as y is equal to function of x, that is, the teaching evaluation score is some function of beauty.\",\n",

Now this person could go to the recovery account and file a claim with the recovery account and the recovery account would pay out $50,000.. now in my story the client lost $75,000, but the recovery account, remember, for any one transaction, the maximum amount that they'll pay is $50,000.. So, again, $50,000 is a maximum amount. On any one deal, $250,000 is the maximum amount per licensee. What that means, again, is for your whole life as a real estate agent, the maximum amount that the recovery account will ever pay out to cover something you screwed up is $250,000. Now, this is not like insurance, and the main way this differs from insurance, of course, is that insurance you don't necessarily have to pay back. With the recovery account you do have to pay this money back. So you might want to make a note of this at the bottom of 28 or the top of 29.. I would write the words: license suspended until paid back, plus interest. Your license will be suspended until you pay the recovery account back this amount plus interest. So, again, this is not like insurance. This is, of course, a situation where this must be reimbursed to the bureau of real estate or your license will stay suspended.

It's really that simple. Now we just need to tell our software that we use what microphone we have plugged in and not to use the internal microphone built into the computer. Most computers will default to the internal mic, so you want to make sure that you don't miss this step. Without doing this, you'll have a lot of great gear plugged into your computer that's doing absolutely nothing. In audacity, you can change your mic source like this. In garageband, it's right here. In pro tools, it's right here. And in audition, it's right here. If you're using another workstation, a simple google search should figure that out for you. Now let's go ahead and add phantom power if you're using a condenser microphone, like i am. So that's this plus 48 volts here. Dynamic mics won't need this, and we'll also enable our track and just like that, you can see that audio is getting into our computer. So let's do a quick check to make sure that we're sourcing from the microphone that i have plugged in and not the internal mic. The best way to do this is to scratch the microphone, and i do the scratch test because it makes it sound that only this mic is going to pick up and it makes it much easier to tell which one is on.

But this creates a completely different type of art music. New music is no longer absolute music, but that would be my suggestion- it becomes relational music. Relational music crosses the border to the other arts and with it a constitutive border of the historical notion of new music is dissolved. Absolute music was the dominant idea of art music in the 20th century, because it was almost impossible for composers to compose with any other aesthetic material than sounds produced by acoustic instruments. Relational music is emerging and is increasingly shaping art music, because today all composers can use the corresponding computer programs. Equally, relational music, like 19th century program music, is a counter concept or the opposite term to the idea of absolute music. In contrast to program music, however, relational music refers not only to a narrative in program music, but to any extra musical material that becomes an essential part of the composition. The so-called extra musical material has so far been excluded from the notion of art music, which defines itself as absolute music. In contrast, the extra musical material is included in the notion of art music, which defines itself as relational music. One could of course object that the idea of relational music is not really new. Composers like pierre chopin, maurizio carvi or helmut lachemann have long since composed with everyday sound, theatrical movements and language. However, the extra musical material was once again subjected by these composers to the logic of absolute music. The everyday noise recorded on tape are processed by schoepfer until they sound completely abstract and all external references are erased.',\n",

Start with a big square u or, if you prefer, the top half of rugby league or rugby goal posts. Then split this up evenly with the 12 months at the bottom. Then, with a ruler, set out even spaces for your rainfall and throw up the numbers on the left hand side. Remember to always include rainfall in milliliters so that the person reading the graph knows what each number signifies. Once you've done that, grab your ruler and put a dot in the middle of each month exactly where the average rainfall fell for that month. Then complete your bar graph. As i said, guys, i'm not spending a whole bunch of time making this look pretty. Once you've completed this, it's always helpful to double check that you've got your measurements right with the average rainfall for that month. Once you've done this, on the other side of your graph, set out in equal parts the temperature going up the right hand side. Don't forget to write out temperature in celsius so that people know what those numbers signify. Then, once again with your ruler, plot out for the middle of each month where the average temperature fell. Make sure the dot is right in the middle of each month and exactly equal to where it should be temperature wise. Then plot it out as a line graph with the dots still being visible. This will help people to read it. And there is a finished climate graph. As you can see, we've got the rainfall as a bar graph down the bottom and the temperature average as a line graph at the top. Here's the same graph with the temperature and rainfall switched around to show you it's pretty much the same thing.\",\n",

Mysql, of course, or any sql database, is something you might be integrating with your hadoop cluster. You can not only import data from scoop into your cluster, you can also export it to mysql as well. So a lot of these technologies like spark have the ability to write to any jdbc or odbc database and you can store and retrieve your results from a sql database if you're so inclined. Cassandra, like hbase and also mongodb, are both also columnar data stores and they're also good choices for exposing your data for real time usage to say, a web application. So you definitely want some sort of layer like this, like cassandra or mongodb, sitting between real time applications and your cluster. We'll talk about those in a lot more depth. Both are very popular choices for vending simple key value data stores at very large transaction rates: mysql, cassandra, mongodb- all external databases that might integrate with your cluster- and there are also several query engines that sit on top of your hadoop cluster. So if you want to actually interactively enter sql queries or whatever, you can do that using these technologies. Again, things don't always fit neatly into different circles here. If you remember hive, that actually is a similar thing as well, but again, since hive is more tightly integrated into hadoop, i chose to leave it out of this particular circle, but it too is a way of querying your data. Apache drill- pretty cool stuff. It actually allows you to write sql queries that will work across a wide range of nosql databases potentially.\",\n",

The older students starting in fourth and fifth grade. They organize that work chronologically and by subject area and they review and discuss what they've learned with their partner. And they return that work packet organized back to either their mailbox or some teachers have a take-home file. Notice at the bottom that kindergarten through second grade takes home a work packet only on tuesday. Grades three through five take home a work packet on thursday and middle school and high school follow a similar pattern. So now our parents know exactly when to expect a packet of work and we usually put the student's contract on top of that packet and they can look through that packet, see where we're differentiating instruction. See our comments, because often i'll make a comment when i'm reviewing that packet. Remember the students are going to organize the packet on friday but they don't go home until the earliest is the following tuesday. So i have several days to look at that packet and make a comment so that i am communicating with home and to the student about work that's happened at school. So differentiating teaching and practice has these simultaneously occurring activities. There's that teaching table, that small group, teacher-led instruction, and that's where you're going to introduce new content. You've introduced it as an overview in whole class but now it's in small group. So what you introduce in whole class that morning is exactly what you're going to teach explicitly in that small group and that's where we're going to use that on-grade level rigorous text and help students access meaning and then other groups of students will be in assigned small groups in collaborative practice.\",\n",

We manage security risks by doing all kinds of different things. Performing a risk assessment is the first part of that equation, and once you've done a risk assessment, now you need to make a decision. You have all the data in front of you. Now you need to decide what to do with the risk that you've discovered and then monitor that decision after you make it. We don't just make a decision and say, yeah, do that. We want to make sure we made the right decision: due care, deciding what to do, due diligence, maintaining that over time, monitoring it over time, making sure that that decision was properly made. So what kind of risk decisions can we make? These you're going to see, you're definitely going to see these in the industry with risk. You can know a risk is there and just accept it.

As part of this exam and this episode, you should be able to understand and describe the key elements of cloud adoption framework and how does it help with the adoption process itself. Before we move to the framework itself, well, let's start with what cloud adoption is. Cloud adoption is simply a strategic move by your organization, your company, in order to leverage cloud in their current business, and this is done simply because cloud has a lot of things to offer to accelerate your business and allow you to innovate and build solutions faster, therefore provide more value to your customers. And cloud adoption framework is a set of tools, best practices, guidelines and documentation created by microsoft to help companies like yours with this journey. This framework is what i will be focusing on today, but please know that i've spent over 40 hours trying to compress this very lengthy, very complex process into high-level overview, so sometimes i might oversimplify some topics, but if any topic will pique your interest during this episode. Feel free to dive into the details. I will include a lot of links in the video description and on my website. That said, let's start with the framework itself. Cloud adoption framework is divided into stages, and the first stage that we'll look at today is called strategy. Strategy is simply building organizational alignment for moving to the cloud. To begin the cloud adoption, the first step in the strategy is called motivations. During this step, you want to answer the question: why move? As such, you want to meet with your key stakeholders and executives in your company to document what are the motivations behind the cloud adoption, and to do that, you need to understand what are your motivation triggers. The most common motivation triggers are either migration triggers, so moving your current infrastructure to the cloud so that you can gain some cost savings.\",\n",

And often just throwing these questions out of the blue, where the patient has no idea where they've come from- the people who are watching you have no idea where they've come from- can look a little bit haphazard and a bit odd. So one thing that's really good is putting a signpost in before you do your psychosocial questions. We're very good at putting signposts in for things like red flags- it's quite natural to us, but for psychosocial we don't do it very often. A couple of reasons for doing signposts. Number one: you're telling the patient that this is what you're about to do here, so they understand you're about to ask some questions about psychosocial. And secondly, you're giving yourself a heads up. You're letting yourself know that this is my time where i've decided i'm going to do my psychosocial questions and i'm going to try and make sure i get them all done together so it looks a little bit more reasonable. So, for example, mrs smith- you know we've not met each other before- i'm just going to ask you a few questions about you and your lifestyle. Sometimes they can affect headaches. Mr jones, i've met you before. I'm just going to ask you a few questions about you and your lifestyle. Sometimes they can affect the bowels. So try and put a signpost in and link it to the symptom that comes. It just helps them to understand why you're doing it. The second thing that you can do is sometimes things like smoking and alcohol can also sound very random.\",\n",

Wenn wir nun allerdings dieses elektron entfernen würden, würde auch hier eine positive ladung auftreten. Gleiches gilt natürlich auch für den p-halbleiter, nur eben andersherum. Das loch ist positiv geladen. Vorsicht an dieser stelle, dass es hier nicht zu verwechslungen kommt: ein loch ist positiv geladen, aber es ist kein proton des atomkerns, sondern ein fehlendes elektron. Wie sieht es nun mit der ladung des dotieratoms im p-dotierten halbleiter aus. Dieses positiv geladene loch zieht ein negativ geladenes elektron an.

Lightly lean into the tamp, applying slow and gentle pressure. The amount of pressure is not as important as repeatability and consistency. Once you feel resistance, remove the tamper carefully to avoid disrupting the coffee bed. Now that our coffee bed is leveled and tamped, we are ready to pull a shot. No matter which machine you use, make sure that it's warmed up and ready to go. Flush some water through the group head for a few seconds to guarantee that it's hot and clean. Insert your portafilter into the group and tighten it into place until it feels snug and tight, but don't over-tighten. Place your scale and cup on the drip tray and then start your shot and timer. Once you reach your yield, stop your shot and note the time. Remember we're looking for our 1 to 1.5 ratio to pull in 30 seconds. If your shot takes well over 30 seconds, you'll need to coarsen your grind. If your shot time is under 25 seconds, you need to adjust your grind finer. Try tasting every shot you pull, even the ones that aren't perfect. You might discover another recipe that's more pleasant to you. That's the beauty of espresso at home. You're the barista and the consumer. Like old towel kind of vibes, not good, smell it? Not so bad right? Perfecting the art of espresso at home takes time, patience and lots of practice.

All of this is pure abstraction, but you can see some representational images here, these figures. You can make that out, that they're figures. So it's not entirely abstract as long as you can make out some representational images within the illustration. It's not pure abstraction because it still has subject matter and story and in this example, again, you can see the abstract shapes that he uses. It's all more abstract because you really can't make out what all of this is really supposed to be. Therefore, it's not really representational. You can make out a figure over here, though his illustrations are highly surrealistic. So here's another example of a more abstract approach. See a lot of abstract shapes everywhere, but within all of this abstraction he introduces these more representational images. You can make out what this is supposed to be. So he's combining abstraction with representational or figurative elements. The style becomes more semi abstract, not entirely abstract or pure abstract. So back again to this page. I hope that those examples helps in gaining a better understanding of abstraction in illustration. I'll be showing more examples later, and it's very important that you see a lot of examples in which the illustrator creates this synthesis of abstraction and realism, of which mark english, as you saw, is a superb example. So what is abstraction? How can it be defined? As it pertains to picture making, it's about simplification, simplifying the forms and shapes in your pictures, and it's about painting shapes and forms that are not representational of any kind of subject matter and that don't have a story.\",\n",

So what does that mean? I mean everybody's ignoring the second sentence. It says in the sba guidelines that the reason the s-corp employee owner doesn't get the health insurance on top of the wages is because wages is to include the health insurance makes total sense to me that the s-corp owner is, yes, getting the health insurance because they're getting wages. The difference is from the c-corp is that the wages are capped at 20,833.. So if you have an owner employee and they're paying themselves over $100,000 and on top of that the health insurance is included in the wages of the s-corp owner, then yeah, there's a haircut there.

But if you have an owner employee and they're paying themselves 60 grand and they have $12,000 in health insurance taxable fringe benefits that are included in their wages, they as the s-corp owner employee get to include $72,000 as part of their payroll costs, plus the retirement.

It's all about the electrons and some lewis dot structures, which, in my opinion, may be the key to happiness. When we get started here, we're really talking about what stuff is made of, and stuff is made of matter. From here you can really kind of go off a cliff in terms of how far you want to go into this. This is really the realm of physics. So i just want to say from the outset that this is a highly abbreviated version of an understanding of what the stuff is in the universe. Matter is made of elements. Elements are pure chemical substances that you can't break down into anything else. Now we organize elements in this amazing table called the periodic table of the elements. It's really amazingly organized and i'm just going to say it: it's beautiful. Okay, how much of a geek am i to say that? But it really is, because if you understand how this table is organized, this is tremendously powerful. Notice, i didn't say if you memorize it. I do not have my students memorize any part of this table. That's what it's there for that's why you can look it up, but you have to understand how to use it and what it means. In terms of elements in the universe, the vast majority of them are the two smallest elements- hydrogen and helium- on our planet, in the earth's crust by weight, we've got oxygen, silicon and aluminum. If you take the earth as a whole, not just the crust by weight, the most abundant element is iron.\",\n",

There's the ones for hypertension, which are the dipines, the dihydropyridines- you don't need to know that dihydropyridines so much, but they're just the dipines. The other ones are the phenylalkamines. The phenylalkamines are verapamil- that's another one you've probably heard of- and the benzothiopines, which is diltiazem. Now, why do we use? Why is there three different classes? Well, the easiest way to remember is that the dipines are for hypertension and that those are definitely vasoselective, whereas verapamil and diltiazem are cardioselective, or cardioselective and vasoselective. You know they work on cardiac and the vessels, but mostly cardioselective, so they're going to work on the heart. So why do we use diltiazem? Oh, i just don't know. I just can't remember. I just i've got this diltazer and this v-wrapper in this, in this image. I just don't know why we use it. Well, that's why we have big monics: they help you remember everything. Diltiazem is a cardioselective calcium channel blocker. We block calcium channels. We stop excitability, we slow it down. We calm it down, calm down calcium- you don't need to get so excited, getting all those channels excited. So we usually see diltiazem, used in atrial fibrillation for rate control.\",\n",

If you enter this course already knowing how to program, my job is to put you out the other end of the course as computer scientist. So what do we call this thing that i said then, if you already know how to program, what's the jargon word for that? It's a precondition, something that must be satisfied. Have you learned this already in 1917? Yes, no, yes, no, no, no. Okay, now you've learned it in 1927. The things that you have to satisfy before starting are called the preconditions. The qualities that you can rely on after finishing are called postconditions, and a function is something that goes from preconditions to postconditions. In c, when you write a function that has preconditions. How do we deal with that? If you're writing a function to divide a number by zero, excellent. You're writing a function to take two numbers in divide one by the other, and the precondition is that the number that goes on the bottom is not zero. How do you write that function?

It should be managed. If there is any break in the flow- this is what we have explained- if there is any break in the flow, there will be a disturbance. So how the disturbance came, when there is a break in the flow, and how this disturbance will be solved through this moving equilibrium. So you need to explain social change by using these two. So this is the concept of social change: whether it is adequate or not. We have to take a stand and we need to explain inadequate or whether it is adequate or whatever it is. So it is a pretty simple question. So every question in this section is very, very easy. I do not find any problem with any of the choices, maybe. No, i do not find anything as a problem. Okay, now we are going to look into this one. This is what we are going to answer. So explain the pattern of patriarchy. And a patriarchy is being altered in a family and at the workplace in the present society. So, guys, it will be. It has been discussed already. So here you can see this one: patriarchy and sexual division of labor. And some of you will not find pdf here, the pdf of this lecture. This is actually the lecture, right? Yeah, the pdf of this lecture is actually given in.',\n",

       "  'input_text': \"Its background lies in and the natural principle of evolution. So through mutation we get different variations of genes and then, through natural selection, those that don't perform well get ruled out, and this process repeats itself until we end up with a diverse set of very well adapted genes. And if we translate that to design, the individuals in a population are the different design solutions and the genes the chromosomes are represented by the values of the properties of the model, so in a parametric model, the values for the parameters. So what we want to do is basically generate a bunch of different design solutions, evaluate them based on their performance and then use the principles of evolution to optimize them and generate new solutions. And to imitate this process of evolution, a few different genetic algorithms have been developed in the past couple of decades. The ones that we use today work quite similarly. So a population is generated, then for each individual the fitness is calculated and then we use the evolutionary operators of selection, crossover and mutation to create a new generation. And what a genetic algorithm is supposed to do is preserve previously found good solutions- that is a principle called elitism- and progress to the true pareto front as fast as possible, which is the convergence rate, as well as- and this is especially important in design- provide a diverse set of solutions to the human decision maker, so that the final solution can be selected by the human designer. And this is especially important in design because we are most of the time dealing with multi objective optimization problems. That means we have multiple, often contradicting, design goals or objectives. So how, in this case, how can we determine if one solution is better than another? And this is where the concept of non domination comes in, that says a one solution is better than the other if it is equal, or if it scores equal or higher in all of the objectives but better in at least one of them.\",\n",

One way you can check for these manually in your manuscript would be to underline all the nouns that you use and make sure that the corresponding, if you have a longer sentence with more than two parts, that they are all parallel. So look at each noun themselves and the accompanying verbs that go with them. Okay, next we're going to talk about writing style. So in our breakdown of these papers, we found that overwhelmingly the passive voice and wordiness accounted for the majority of style issues, and i want to reiterate what i had said earlier, that this is not a hard and fast rule to say don't use the passive voice, only use the active. Far from it. And editors have a difficult time discerning when the author would like us to use the passive and active. It's simply regardless of how good the editor is, they have to make that call, and it could change your meaning, your intended meaning, to some extent. So you want to be able to make that decision for yourself. So, regarding the use of active passive voice, it's advisable to use the active if you can with an agent.

So what do you recommend for students with test anxiety, as semesters are gonna be wrapping up in a few months here and yeah well, there's lots of little tips for test anxiety and, angela, i'll turn this over to you after. I just make a few starting points here. First of all, you need to be prepared for your exam. If you're going to be prepared for your exam- that's going to help some- you need to think about some techniques that will work for you to keep your mind focused. So deep breathing always helps. That helps an awful lot of people with helping them to focus and direct their attention to what they're doing and relieve that test anxiety. So you breathe in through your nose, hold that for a count of four and then breathe out through your mouth. Now remember when we have post-operative patients in the clinical area and their pulse ox drops, what do we tell them to do? We tell them to deep breathe. That's the first thing we ask them to do is to deep breathe, and we watch their pulse oxes most of the time go right back up again. Well, that's why deep breathing is important, because it's going to help to bring a lot of oxygen into your body and it's going to bring it to your brain where you want it the most- when you're taking an exam. The other thing that i have seen happen with students is when they're coming to class and they're taking an exam, they'll all congregate outside the classroom till the classroom is empty from the previous group of students that were in there and they all start talking about what they studied, what's going to be on the exam, what this, what that.\",\n",

Now, the whole thing here was done in real time, so what else can i do here? Well, i'm going to introduce a circle shape and i'm thinking of a sun that i'm going to add here.

Pieck is the master. He really knows what to do to arrive at this style that he used for rollerball. It's more abstract.

This will give you 42.96.. If we do the same thing for tenured male instructors, we will take the row total 361, multiply by the column total 268, divided by 463.. we get 208.96.. If we repeat the same procedure for all of them, we get these values. If we take the row totals, column totals and grand total, we will get the same values as the totals, as the observed values. Now, going back to this formula, if we take a summation of all the observed minus the expected values, all squared divided by the expected value, we will get a chi-square value of 2.557, and the degree of freedom will be one. On the chi-square table we check the degree of freedom equals row one and find the value closest to 2.557.. Here we can see that 2.557 will most likely fall in between a p-value of 0.1 and 0.25.

       "  'input_text': \"Compressors can have hard or soft knees. Soft knee refers to the rounded knee shape or a gentle transition, and hard knee refers to a sharper shape where the compressor reaches full ratio immediately above the threshold. A soft knee can also sweeten the sound of a compressor near the threshold. For those models of compressors that have only hard knees, some of the effects of a soft knee can be simulated by reducing the ratio or raising the threshold, which will result in less action by the compressor. Attack time: attack time is the time it takes for a compressor to implement a full gain reduction after the signal has crossed the threshold. Because digital compressors can react with essentially infinite speed, a digital compressor set to 100 milliseconds may sound similar to an analog compressor set, say, to 40 milliseconds. The method the designer uses to define attack is not standardized so it is not possible to compare specific attack times between brands. It's better to remove all labels besides slow and fast, and just listen. With digital compressors, typical attack times used in music for mastering can range from 30 milliseconds to 300 milliseconds, or even longer on some occasions, with the average time used being probably around 100 milliseconds. But go by your ears, not the numbers, to help set your attack time. Listen to the percussive and transient quality of the music. Shorter attack times soften transients and produce the more closed sound. Longer attack times: let the music breathe and reveal more of the percussive transients. Release time: release time or recovery time is how long it takes for the signal to return to unity gain after it has dropped below the threshold.\",\n",

It's a method of time management that involves setting aside specific periods of time to complete specific tasks. This helps to eliminate distractions and get more things done. Time blocking creates what psychologists call an implementation intention. This simply means that when we time block something, we are more likely to actually do it, because we know what we'll do and when we'll do it. So how do you time block? It's simple: first write out all the stuff you want to get done on a sheet of paper or your notepad. Then open your calendar and allocate blocks of time to each task. Make sure to leave some buffer time in between tasks in case one takes longer than expected. Also, don't try to do everything on your to-do list, because there are always more things to do than how much you can actually do in a day. Personally, i like to use something called the 1-2-3 method: pick one big, important task, two medium ones and three small, miscellaneous ones. I talk about this in another video, if you're curious. Implementing these habits may take some practice, but eventually they will become your second nature. Thanks for watching and make sure to subscribe if you like this video.\",\n",

So it's the line element, or space time interval. It's this object here. Now, the curve geometry is not spherically symmetric like the schwarzschild case, due to the frame dragging effect and the dilation in the equatorial plane due to rotation. So in the schwarzschild case we had a spherical shape. This one is oblate spheroidal because of the rotation, so it bulges in the direction of the equatorial plane. Okay, it dilates away from the rotation axis. So for those two reasons, there you have a geometry that's not spherically symmetric. Now that has some implications. So that means that purely radial paths for test particles are not possible, meaning that the total angular momentum of these particles is not conserved.

That is, signal delay varies with frequency. The higher the q, the more phase shift. This kind of filter will always alter the musical timing and wave shape, also known as phase distortion. Whenever you have to equalize, you will always alter the signal in both the time and frequency domains. There will always be a time artifact in the analog-styled equalizer, which is usually mathematically termed minimum phase, the alteration will be primarily to spread the signal downstream, ie it does not lead the original signal by much. A downstream modification translates into different delays at different frequencies, dispersing the original signal. In some cases this effect is quite audible. If one uses a digital approach, one can either mimic the analog behavior or use a linear phase, aka constant delay filter. This filter will equally proceed and follow the signal. Part of the filter may create a pre-echo effect, modifying the leading edge of the transients and signal changes. A high q linear phase filter can introduce audible pre-echo in the short millisecond range. It's exactly like a floor bounce, but without the cone filtering. Anytime that a high q filter is used, careful listening with both types of equalization may be necessary to decide which choice is best. If you're looking for an aggressive sound, perhaps minimum phase is your best choice, but if you're looking for a natural sound, particularly at high frequencies, linear phase is your best choice. Narrow band peaks and dips can be accomplished in linear phase, avoiding the smeary quality that occurs in minimum phase with sharp bands. The majority is still out on which type of equalizer is best for low frequencies. Mid-side mastering.\",\n",

I got to hear some more evidence. Just based off of what i know, the germany would still do their actions with the schlieffen plan. There's also a discussion about culture and mentality in 1914. That's part of me. James joel, for example, suggests that the cultural, military and strategic zeitgeist saw war as a practical and indeed desirable, actual for social change and defense of national interest. Okay, yeah, i was interpreting that differently. Militarism, absolutely. We're talking about how all these tough guys and fake tough guys and governments and militaries, the way that they spoke and the tough guy persona of the glory of warfare. You know that these guys have been bored and bread with since childhood is a very legitimate argument, since modern war also involved the need for a quick mobilization by a rail timetables.\",\n",

       "  'input_text': 'Of course there were always counter-movements, such as program music, but these always remind a kind of secondary idea in the self-description of art music. The next question is which normative guiding idea belonged to the paradigm of new music? The short answer is newness. The modern arts have developed through a negation of the central idea of classical art, namely through a negation of the idea of beauty that has been valid in the arts for centuries. Even today, old art academies carry the classical idea of beauty in their name. Literally translated, the academy of arts in munich is called academy of beautiful arts. However, modern art no longer wants to be beautiful, but above all it wants to be new, which is reflected in the name of new music. New music was new, above all because of it used new compositional techniques to create new music experiences. In this respect, new music in the 20th century followed a material aesthetic whose normative idea was to permanently create new aesthetical material. With adorno, one can say that new music followed the ideal of so-called material progress. The paradigm of new music in the 20th century is thus composed of a descriptive and of a normative guiding idea. It was in itself understanding as absolute music and followed the normative ideal of material aesthetics or material progress. For a long time, the idea of material aesthetics was a source of innovation, but as early as the 1970s the end of material progress was reached. The last new isms, such as music, concrete instrumentals, spectralism, minimalism- they are all developed almost half a century ago. Since the 1990s, the dilemma of innovation has become evident, as even helmut lachenmann noted in an essay at that time.',\n",

This is evident when you set a breakpoint in the debugger and then step through each line of code. You can think of this path of execution as a thread. In fact, you write all of your code in what is known as the main thread. This is the thread that runs your code, but also the code that manages the user interface as well. As you add threads to your code, you actually have more paths of execution. This means you can do multiple things at once. One thread can be responding to user input and another thread could be downloading files across the network. A thread runs on a cpu core. The more cores that a device has, the more threads can run at the same time. If there are more threads than resources to run them, then the cpu will switch between them. One moment a thread is trucking along drawing a circle on the screen and the next moment it is asleep. Moments later it is awake, unaware that it was ever asleep. Computers process information so fast that you can't see the process. Writing synchronous code or code that runs one step at a time on the main thread is the most straightforward way to write code. All lines of code you write are performed on the main thread, unless you or the api you're using do otherwise. In this scenario, if some function, call or operation takes a fair bit of time to complete, then your program's interface might stop responding until this finishes. Unresponsive, choppy or laggy apps are a poor user experience and should be avoided. The alternative to this is to perform your time-consuming tasks asynchronously or concurrently on multiple background threads in order to keep the rest of your app running smoothly.\",\n",

But right across the area in michigan there's beautiful stands of medium red clover in 120-plus bushel and acre wheat. So one thing i've seen with medium red clover: it's rarely this happens, but it might get up too tall in the wheat so it'll affect the harvest. So it'll be more like a forage and a grain harvest at the same time. That's never fun, but we can produce significant amounts of nitrogen with this good root system, good soil builder, often our least cost cover crop. Again, it's something we frost seed, starting here relatively soon. Well, once the three foot of snow's gone, easily killed and excellent for forage. And i need to understand, there's not three foot of snow out there and it's 60 degrees. So after this presentation, go out and sun yourself. Okay, outside clover seed cost is generally a little higher than the medium red clover. Not as good for forage as some of the other clovers. Good okay for cattle, not so good for horses. So we've got to be careful how we're using our forage. Again, a very good nitrogen producer, lower growing than the medium red clover is going to be. It does very well in the wetter soils. So if you've got a situation where you want to frost seed this in to wheat and you've got some lower areas, this may be one that would be a little more productive in those areas. So a medium red alpsite mixture might not be a bad mix to use as well.\",\n",

Here, the conservator uses high-pressure steam concentrated through a nozzle to clean the surface of this mosaic. An absorbent material called a poultice is applied to the surface of this mosaic. This is to remove an old, discolored resin applied by previous restorers to consolidate the mortar or to enhance the sheen of the tesserae. This poultice is a soft gel of synthetic clay and solvents. It is applied over a barrier layer of tissue and covered with a layer of plastic to slow evaporation, allowing it time to dissolve the resin. The poultice is left on for several hours before it is removed. Ultraviolet light is used to assist the conservator in identifying areas where the discolored resin still remains. In 1889, the art institute made its first purchases of ancient art. The first president of its board of trustees, charles l hutchinson, and the first director of the museum, william french, went on a journey to europe, and on that journey william french took with him a very small notebook where he made observations. He made notations about museums that he had visited, but he also made note of the objects that he and hutchinson had purchased.

Now that's a really nice one to work on. I would do that every session. You do your run leg even multiple times per week, especially because you're going to get tight quads on the bike. You're going to get tight quads when you are running. So this exercise relieves off that tightness, makes the muscle more efficient, gives you more mobility through the hip and the knees, so when you're running it's not as stiff and you're more fluid with that. But also it tackles any type of femoral pain that might be coming in. If you're getting tightness around the quad it'll drag that patella femoral compartment tighter and that will maybe give you some of the problems that you're having in your knee. So this quad exercise is gold for you. One minute, maybe up to two minute stretches with a full glute on both sides and with the mobility section.

Now the first one i like to always start off with is one of my favorites. It's beta blockers. Beta blockers- as soon as i say beta blockers, you should say beta blockers, you should say beta fish. Right, and we've got here our character, which is a blue beta fish. Beta fish- now the way we're going to talk about staying in line- are beta blockers, knowing the drug ending. Well, beta blockers- always- a few rare exceptions and for good reason- end in o-l-o-l, so o-l-o-l. you need to remember that. Well, i like to remember here at pygmonic, we have our blue beta fish sitting on these blocks for beta blocker and then we've got, of course, licking a lollipop, a fish with lips licking a lollipop. Oh, my goodness, i know it's just great. I love our little beta fish here, so cute. But just by learning that right there, you can learn tons of different beta blockers. There's so many different ones. Look at this list of beta blockers here there's so many different ones and there are a couple of key ones that end in a-l-o-l, which means they have alpha blocking capability as well. But that's not what we're going to stick with today. Learning this, you can immediately learn a beta blocker. Now there's one thing you should be thinking about when i say beta blockers. What do you need to be thinking about? When i say beta blockers?\",\n",
