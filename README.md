If you want to experiment with the notebooks, you will need to download these files
    -merged_data_for_AI.csv
    -sentence_transformer_embedding.csv

from 

https://bechtle365.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/BG365-Artificial-TheIntelligents/EkNtlvsuooJHhumJdNCP7WMByCLd3Dbfgmv2wuoVU6OYYQ. 


Then place them into notebooks/learning_journeys/data/ . 

If you want to experiment with the corrected punctuations, you'll need also to copy the punctuation_correction from this link into the data directory. 


Transcripts with corrected punctuation and the sumy summaries created from them can also be found in
